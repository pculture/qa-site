Chet Rong here
with the Rong way to do Agile

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,317
Today, stand-ups.

6
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:13,757
First, do you stand-ups sitting down

7
00:00:13,757 --> 00:00:16,008
so that everyone is comfortable.

8
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,220
<i>The more people, the better</i>
so invite the whole office.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,854
<i>Be sure to vary meeting time and places</i>

10
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,926
<i>to keep everyone on their toes.</i>

- Hello?

12
00:00:24,393 --> 00:00:26,393
<i>- Next, pass an object around</i>

13
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,856
<i>and make sure that the object is heavy</i>

14
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:30,980
<i>so everyone can feel the weight</i>
of what is being said.

15
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,467
Whoever is holding
the object should listen

16
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,628
while everyone else talks.

17
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:37,823
Talk about whatever you need
for as long as you want.

18
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:41,427
Discuss any and all issues at length.

00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,087
These meetings will take up
most of the morning

21
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:51,669
but you'll still have a few hours
in the afternoon

22
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:53,679
to get project work done.
