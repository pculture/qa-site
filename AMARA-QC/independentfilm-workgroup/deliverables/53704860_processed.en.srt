&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME OLD

207
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,567

00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,633
&gt;&gt; Baron: THE NEXT MORNING, IT

212
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,133

213
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,700
INDUSTRY WAS SHOWING OFF ITS

214
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:22,833
LATEST AND GREATEST.

215

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,333
&gt;&gt; Baron: WHAT IS HOT-N-HARD

218

219
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,133
&gt;&gt; IT IS A MALT BEVERAGE WITH A

220
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,100
SERRANO PEPPER IN IT.

221
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,733
&gt;&gt; Baron: IF YOU DRINK THIS, DO

222
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,033
YOU GET THIGH LIKE THAT?

223
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,000
&gt;&gt; IF YOU DRINK A LOT.

224
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,067
&gt;&gt; Baron: OKAY, GREAT.

225
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,167

226
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,467
&gt;&gt; OH, HE JUST LIKES TO "QUACK"

227
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:38,600
ONE OPEN ONCE IN AWHILE.

228
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:39,933
&gt;&gt; Baron: OKAY!

229
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,833
MEANWHILE, IT WAS ALL QUIET AT

230
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,133
THE ANHEUSER-BUSCH BOOTH.

231
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,433
IS THERE LIKE A HOTPRODUCT THAT

232
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,467
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

233
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:46,867
&gt;&gt; NO.

234
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,100
&gt;&gt; Baron: WHAT WAS THE LAST HOT

235
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,067
THING THAT YOUREMEMBER THAT WAS

236
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:49,467
LAUNCHED?

237
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:50,400
&gt;&gt; MIKE'S LEMONADE.

238
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:51,867
&gt;&gt; Baron: REALLY?

239
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,867
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I DID MISS

240
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,633
THESE GUYS.

241
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,467
BUT WHAT I DIDN'TMISS WAS BEING

242
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,067
IN THE TRENCHES OF THE BEER

243
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,767
BUSINESS, 24-7, IN A WAR THAT

244
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:01,700
NEVER LET UP.

245
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,167
&gt;&gt; ...CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT

246
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,233
FOR DOMESTIC BEER RIGHT NOW.

247
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,633
THEY'RE ALL FIGHTING TO GET A

248
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,000
BIGGER PIECE OF APIE THAT'S NO T

249
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,033
GROWING.

250
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,367
&gt;&gt; Baron: DO YOU THINK BEER IS

251
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:11,300
IN DECLINE, OVERALL?

252
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,633
&gt;&gt; ALL THE BIGBREWERS ARE DOWN.

253
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,433
THE DOMESTIC BEERSARE DECLINING

254
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,967
A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT.

255
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:17,533
IMPORTS ARE GROWING SOLIDLY.

256
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,867
CRAFT BEERS AREGROWING SOLIDLY.

257
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:21,633
BEER IS ALSO FIGHTING AGAINST

258
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,800
WINE AND SPIRITS.

259
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:27,333
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING VERY...

260
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,533
UNCERTAIN.

261
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,367
&gt;&gt; Baron: HOW DID WE GET HERE?

262
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,233
HOW DID THREE COMPANIES COME TO

263
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,867
DOMINATE THE AMERICAN BEER

264
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,300
INDUSTRY?

265
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,233
THE FOUNDERS OF ANHEUSER-BUSCH,

266
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,633
MILLER, AND COORS CAME TO

267
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,033
AMERICA IN THE MID-1800s WITH A

268
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,800
DREAM AND A BEARD.

269
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:45,333
BY 1900, THERE WERE OVER 1,800

270
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
BREWERIES.

271
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,100
THESE DREAMS WERE CRUSHED BY

272
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,933
PROHIBITION, BUT THEN BUILT UP

273
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,900
AGAIN IN THE 1950s.

274
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:58,067
&gt;&gt; BEER AND ALE HOLDTHEIR PLACE

275
00:07:58,133 --> 00:07:59,900
ON THE SHOPPING LIST TODAY,

276
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,833
ALONG WITH THE BREAD AND MILK

277
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,067
AND VEGETABLES.

278
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,433
&gt;&gt; Baron: WITH THEIR HUGE

279
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,800
MARKETING BUDGETS, THE BIG

280
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:07,400
BREWERS KILLED OFF MANY LOCAL

281
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,133
AND REGIONAL BREWERIES.

282
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:10,900
&gt;&gt; THE BREWERS ARESPENDING MORE

283
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,233
AND MORE ON MARKETING AND

284
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,800
ADVERTISING, DOING WHAT TOBACCO

285
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,000
COMPANIES HAVE DONE FOR

286
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,067
GENERATIONS.

287
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,633
WE SEE HORSES -- BIGONES -- FOR

288
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,967
BEER, BARS -- NICE ONES -- BEER

289
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,333
BASKETBALL, BEER SOFTBALL, BEER

290
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,433
VOLLEYBALL, EVEN BEER SOCCER.

291
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,667
&gt;&gt; Baron: THE RESULT WAS

292
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:27,900
DEVASTATING TO THE SMALL

293
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:28,433
BREWERS.

294
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,967
&gt;&gt; THE GREAT AMERICAN BEER WAR,

295
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,833
A BATTLEGROUND OF CORPORATIONS,

296
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,300
CAREERS, AND CASH.

297
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:36,867
SINCE 1970, 35 LOCAL BEERS HAVE

298
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,700
BEEN KILLED OFF, DRIVEN OUT OF

299
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,500
BUSINESS, OR BOUGHT OUT BY THE

300
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:41,867
GIANTS, GONE FOREVER.

301
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,000
&gt;&gt; Baron: BY 1978, THERE WERE

302
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,933
ONLY 45 BREWERIES LEFT IN

303
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,167
AMERICA.

304
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,200
AND THE GIANTS WERE FIGHTING

305
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,100
EACH OTHER FOR SUPREMACY.

306
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,333
&gt;&gt; MILLER IS THE COUNTRY'S

307
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,767
SECOND-LARGEST BREWER AND WANTS

308
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,633
TO BE NUMBER ONE.

309
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,100
ANHEUSER-BUSCH ISNUMBER ONE AND

310
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,033
WANTS TO STAY THERE.

311
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
&gt;&gt; NEVER WILL THEY KNOCK US

312
00:08:59,167 --> 00:08:59,800
OVER.

313
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,133
&gt;&gt; WE FEEL THEY FEEL OUR HOT

314
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
BREATH RIGHT ON THEIR BACK.

315
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,833
&gt;&gt; BUT OUR MAJOR PROBLEM IS

316
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,867
MILLER.

317
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,833
WE MUST ATTACK THEM WHERE THEY

318
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,000
ARE STRONG, AND WE MUST DO SO

319
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,067
NOW.

320
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,900
&gt;&gt; AS THE QUARTERBACK OF THIS

321
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,400
TEAM, I CAN ASSURE YOU OF

322
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:24,500
AGGRESSIVENESS, DETERMINATION,

323
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,100
AND HUMILITY.

324
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,033
IT HAS BEEN CORRECTLY SAID THAT

325
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,900
WARS PRODUCE ADVANCEMENT.

326
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,500
WE NEED TO BE LEANAND HUNGRY TO

327
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,467
TAKE ON ALL COMERS.

328
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,233
&gt;&gt; WHO WILL OWN THE FUTURE?

329
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,400
WHO WILL OWN TOMORROW?

330
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:41,800
THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT WE DO

331
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,767
TODAY.

332
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,867
FOR US, THE ANHEUSER-BUSCH

333
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,400

664
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:04,967
NEXT.

665
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,500
IF IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE, IT'S

666
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:07,800
NOT REALLY SOMETHING WE'RE

667
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:08,800
INTERESTED IN DOING.

668
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,100
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU READY TO DUMP THIS

669
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:10,600
SHIT IN?

670
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,933
&gt;&gt; THIS CHOCOLATE APHRODISIAC?

671
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,300
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU KNOW IT.

672
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:14,600
&gt;&gt; PHILOSOPHICALLY, I THINK

673
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,067
THERE'S A GIGANTIC GAP BETWEEN

674
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,267
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A BIG

675
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,633
BREWERY AND A SMALL BREWERY.

676
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,600
BIG BREWERIES AREUSUALLY PUBLIC

677
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:22,233
COMPANIES.

678
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,767
SO, WHETHER THEY'RE MAKING BEER

679
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,200
OR SODA OR WHATEVER, THEY'RE

680
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,733
REAL GOAL AT THE END OF THE DAY

681
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,867
IS MAXIMIZINGSHAREHOLDER VALUE ,

682
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:30,900
WHEREAS OUR GOAL IS MAXIMIZING

683
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:32,933
THE FLAVOR OF WHAT WE'RE MAKING

684
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,767
FOR OUR OWN ENJOYMENT AS THE

685
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,133
PEOPLE MAKING IT.

686
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,300
&gt;&gt; MAN, THOSE ANCIENT HONDURAN

687
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,100
KNEW WHAT TO DRINK.

688
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,167
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

689
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:42,300
&gt;&gt; YES, THEY DID. YES,THEY DID .

690
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,867
I STARTED HOME BREWING IN '93,

691
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,333
BUT RIGHT AFTER I BREWED MY

692
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,900
FIRST BATCH, I STARTED TELLING

693
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,533
PEOPLE, "THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO

694
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,500
DO WITH MY LIFE.

695
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,133
PRETTY. IT'S NICE.

696
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,900
TO START THE BREWPUB WAS A REAL

697
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:53,633
CHALLENGE.

698
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,300
I WAS NAIVE ENOUGH TO THINK I

699
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,067
COULD JUST GO TO A BANK AND GET

700
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:58,633
MONEY FROM A BANK TO OPEN A

701
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,767
BRAND-NEW VENTURE.

702
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,433
I WAS 25 WHEN I MOVED DOWN HERE

703
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,033
AND STARTED THE BREWERY, AND I

704
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,667
JUST STARTED, YOU KNOW, WORKING

705
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,433
ON THE BUILDING,SIGNED A LEASE .

706
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,833
AND THEN SOMEBODYCAME UP TO ME ,

707
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,233
AND THEY WERE LIKE,"YOU DO KNOW

708
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,500
IT'S ILLEGAL TO OPEN A BREWERY

709
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:11,200

I'M LIKE, "REALLY?"

711
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,100
WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO, I WAS

712
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,333
ARGUING IN THE FLOOR OF THE

LEGISLATION.

715
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,533
IT CAUSED A LITTLE ANXIETY AT

716
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,833
THE 11th HOUR, BUT WE GOT IT

717
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,233
LEGALIZED THREE DAYS BEFORE WE

718
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
OPENED.

KNOW?

724
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,167
WE WERE LITERALLY THE SMALLEST

725
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:34,633
BREWERY IN THE COUNTRY WHEN WE

726
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,500
OPENED IN 1995.

THE CONCEPT OF HONEYMOON CAME

748
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,533
FROM THESE KINDS OF DRINKS IN

&gt;&gt; WHEN I WROTE MY BUSINESS

762
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,267
PLAN, MY GOAL WAS TO MAKE

763
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,167
SPECIAL, UNIQUE BEERS AND SELL

764
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,867
THEM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

765
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,500
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

766
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,200
MEANT, IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION

767
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,267
AND HOW DIFFICULTTHAT WOULD BE ,

768
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,967
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE'RE IN

769
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:51,767
COASTAL, RURAL DELAWARE.

770
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,767
I NEVER DREAMED THAT WE'D GET

00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,400
THAT BIG.

772
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,833
IT'S AN OBSCENE AMOUNT OF DEBT

00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,200
THAT I'VE GOTTEN MYFAMILY INTO.

774
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:00,600
SO, PERSONALLY, WE BETTER GET

775
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:06,233
OUR STUFF RIGHT.

776
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,600
OUR BREWERY'S GROWING AT A

777
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:08,467
RIDICULOUS RATE.

778
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:10,000
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BREWERY OF

779
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:11,900
THIS SCALE IN THIS STATE.

780
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,000

781
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:16,767
HAVE.

782
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,667
EXTREME GROWTH CAN BE PAINFUL.

783
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,067
IT'S KIND OF A NIGHTMARE,

784
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:21,633
REALLY.

785
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,400
WE'RE ON PACE TO DOABOUT 40,000

787
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:26,667
SUCH THAT IF WE COULD FILL THEM

788
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,200
FROM OUR DISTRIBUTORS, WE'D

789
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,700
PROBABLY BE DOING 50,000 OR

790

60,000 BARRELS.

BECAUSE IT'S A NEW ENTRY INTO

829
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,633
THE BEER MARKETPLACE.

830
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,733
IT HAS CAFFEINE IN IT.

831
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,900
AND THAT'S GOT A PRETTY GOOD

832
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:52,567
STORY BEHIND IT.

833
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:53,567
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NEED

834
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:53,933
ANYMORE.

835
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,300
&gt;&gt; OH.

836
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,433
WELL, THAT'S ALL THERE IS, AND

837
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,467
IT'S SITTING OVER THERE...

838
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:57,567
&gt;&gt; IF IT SELLS LIKE WE THINK

839
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:59,267
IT'S GONNA SELL,THEN IT'LL KEEP

840
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,967
A FULL FACE FOR THE TERM.

841
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:01,433
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

842
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,100
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL.

843
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,467
&gt;&gt; I WOULD -- I'DLOVE TO PUT UP

844
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,433
A SIGN SOMEWHERE, BUT...

845
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,867
&gt;&gt; WE CAN HANG A SIGN FOR YOU.

846
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:08,967
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

847
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:10,200
&gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU -- WHAT

848
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:11,600
LOCATION IS GONNA BE THE MOST

849
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:12,967
VISIBLE AND HAVE THE LONGEST

850
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:13,367
LIFE?

851
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,833
YOU GO PUT UP A SIGNONE DAY AND

852
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,233
YOU GO BACK TO THATSTORE OR BAR

853
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,533
THE NEXT DAY AND IT'S DOWN AND

854
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,700
THERE'S ANOTHERBANNER IN PLACE .

855
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,133
THAT'S WHAT BEER WARS ARE ALL

856
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,567
ABOUT.

857
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:25,667
I'LL SEE YOU THURSDAY.

858
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,367
I LOVE THE BEER INDUSTRY, AND

859
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,300
SOMEHOW IT'S BEEN IN MY BLOOD.

860
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:31,667
YOU KNOW, I'M CO-FOUNDER OF

861
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:35,100
SAM ADAMS, AND I WAS WORKING

862
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,067
WITH JIM KOCH, THE FOUNDER OF

863
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:39,967
THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY.

864
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,867
&gt;&gt; WHEN I THOUGHTABOUT STARTING

865
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:43,600
THE COMPANY, I THOUGHT, "WELL, I

866
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,233
KNOW BREWING, BUT I DON'T KNOW

867
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,700
BARS.

868
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,967
I NEED SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS BARS."

869
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:50,100
AND A BAR WAS RHONDA'S NATURAL

870
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:50,900
HABITAT.

871
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,900
SHE WAS TOTALLY COMFORTABLE,

872
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:54,500
COULD LIGHT UP A BAR.

873
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:55,867
BARTENDERS LOVED HER 'CAUSE

874
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:58,167
SHE'D BEEN A BARTENDER HERSELF.

875
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,233
&gt;&gt; MY COLOMBIAN FRIEND.

876
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,833
SMOOTH, EASY TO DRINK.

877
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,700
&gt;&gt; THAT IS NICE.

878
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:05,000
&gt;&gt; IT'S REALLY THE ULTIMATE

879
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:05,667
PARTY BEER.

880
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:06,967
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, I'LL BUY

881
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,233
YOU WHAT YOU DRINK, BUT I THINK

882
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,167
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

883
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:10,600
LITERALLY, I SPEND FOUR OR FIVE

884
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,700
NIGHTS A WEEK INSIDE BARS.

885
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:14,567
&gt;&gt; HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

886
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,933
&gt;&gt; TAKING A LITTLE MOONSHOT.

887
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,500
HERE, YOU CAN PUT ONE AROUND

888
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:19,800
EACH WHATEVER.

889
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:20,867
&gt;&gt; EACH NOSTRIL?

890
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:22,733
&gt;&gt; YEAH, OR ANYWHEREYOU WANT TO

891
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,333
PUT IT.

892
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,100
IT'S A TEDIOUS, DIFFICULT WAY

893
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,667
TO DO IT, BUT WHEN YOU'RE

894
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,367
UNDER-CAPITALIZED AND YOU'RE

895
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,300
BUILDING A SEGMENTFROM SCRATCH,

896
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:32,133
YOU NEED TO BE THERE TO REALLY

897
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,867
UNDERSTAND THE REACTIONS FROM

898
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:34,500
PEOPLE.

899
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:35,800
&gt;&gt; SO, IT'S A CURE FOR WHISKEY

900
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:36,167
DICK?

901
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:38,300
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

902
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,900
&gt;&gt; IT'S A CURE FOR WHAT?

903
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:40,833
&gt;&gt; WHISKEY DICK.

904
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,200
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST REALLYHAND-TO-HAND

905
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:42,633
COMBAT.

906
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,500
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU MARRIED?

907
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:44,133
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.

908
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,300

00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:47,200
GOING TO THE BARS AND

911
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:47,700
EVERYTHING?

912
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:48,800
&gt;&gt; WELL, WHEN HE MET ME, I WAS

913
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:49,967
IN THE BEER BUSINESS,SO THIS IS

914
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:50,467
ALL I KNOW.

915
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:51,333
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

916
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,933
&gt;&gt; CHEERS TO MOONSHOT.

917
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,833
&gt;&gt; I'M LEARNING EVERY DAY ABOUT

918
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,800
HOW TO SEE THE BRANDIN THIS NEW

919
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:02,100
CENTURY.

920
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,767
WHAT I DID 23 YEARS AT

921
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,133
SAM ADAMS -- IT'SVERY DIFFERENT

922
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,267
NOW, GIVEN 35 BREWERIES THEN,

923
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,567
VERSUS THE 1,400 INTHIS COUNTRY

924
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:16,267
NOW.

925
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,600
&gt;&gt; WE STARTED IT TOGETHER,SO WE

926
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,600
WENT THROUGH ALL THE TRENCH

927
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,867
WARFARE, THE UPS AND THE DOWNS.

928
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,967
BUT WE SHARED ALL THAT, YEAR

929
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:25,967
AFTER YEAR.

930
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,600
AT THE END, SHE CAME TO ME AND

931
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:29,200
SAID, "WELL, YOU'VE TAUGHT ME

932
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:30,833
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW AND THAT'S

933
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,533
GREAT, BUT NOW I'M NOT LEARNING

934
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,633
ANYTHING NEW.

935
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,533
AND I CAN'T GETPROMOTED BECAUSE

936
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,300
THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER JOB FOR

937
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,200
ME TO MOVE INTO ANDTHAT'S YOURS

938
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:41,033
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE."

939
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,033
WHEN SHE LEFT, I FELT LIKE SHE

940
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,867
WAS READY.

941
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:45,100
&gt;&gt; Baron: DO YOU MISS HER?

942
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,733
&gt;&gt; OH, SURE.

943
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,933
&gt;&gt; I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE

944
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,267
NEXT EVOLUTION OF THE INDUSTRY

945
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,600
IS INDEPENDENT.

946
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,067
THE BEER BUSINESS DOES NEED

947
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,700
INNOVATION, AND IF A CONSUMER'S

948
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,233
DRINKING SOMETHING OTHER THAN

949
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,800
THE BIG THREE, THEN THERE'S A

950
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:00,733
REASON FOR THAT.

951
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,100
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A

952
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:03,200
STATEMENT.

953
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,467
MY PLAN FOR THE LAUNCH OF

954
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:08,333
MOONSHOT IS BOSTONAND NEW YORK .

955
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,233
SO, I'M PICKING MY SPOTS, AND

956
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,033
I'M GERMINATING IT -- JUST A

957
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,433
HANDFUL OF ACCOUNTS.

958
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,200
FOR NOW, WITH THIS STORE -- I

959
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:17,633
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

960
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,000
TIGER BEER, BUT MAYBE WE COULD

961
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:20,100
SQUEEZE RIGHT IN THERE.

962
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,733
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINKIT'S REASONABLE

963
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,067
TO ASK THEM FOR ONE CASE.

964
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,400
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THIS ISREALLY GONNA BE

965
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:27,100

IMPORT AGAIN.

968
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,700
I'D SAY IN THIS AREA, THOUGH

969
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:33,933
IT'S NOT THE FASTEST-MOVING

970
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,667

THE BIG GUYS HAVE THE MUSCLE TO

MUSCLE US OUT IF THEY WANT.

976
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:51,600

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,900

&gt;&gt; WELL, AS A BREWMASTER,I HAVE

1481

WHAT YOU MIGHT CALLTHE GREATEST

1482
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,433
JOB IN THE WORLD BECAUSE I GET

1483
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,067
TO MAKE BEER AND TO WORK FOR A

1484
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:10,833
COMPANY LIKEANHEUSER-BUSCH THAT

1485
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,433
IS AS PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING

1486
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,833

DA-DA-DA THAT.

1490
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:21,100
I DON'T WANT TO SEE A SIX-PACK

1491
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:23,467

1492
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:25,833

I KNOW WHAT IT TOOK TO GET US

1495
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:29,633
INTO THAT BOTTLE.

1496
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,767
&gt;&gt; CRAFT BEERS HAVE BEEN DOING

1497
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,933
WELL LATELY IN THE MARKET, AND

1498
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,133
SO WE'RE BREWING BEERS THAT ARE

1499
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
COMPARABLE IN TASTE, PROFILE,

1500
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,233
AND APPEARANCE WITH THEIRS.

1501
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:41,733
A BEER LIKE PUMPKIN SPICE WOULD

1502
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,133
HAVE SOME SPICES IN IT AND,JUST

1503
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,467
LIKE WHEN YOU COOK ON THE STOVE

1504
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:45,800
AT HOME, YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE

1505
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:47,033
OF THIS AND A LITTLE MORE OF

1506
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,300
THAT UNTIL YOU GET IT THE WAY

1507
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:49,733
YOU LIKE IT.

1508
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,667
&gt;&gt; TO THE UNINITIATED CONSUMER,

1509
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:53,167
HE GOES UP TO THAT DOOR --

1510
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,933
"WELL, I'M NOT GONNA RISK EIGHT

1511
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,367
BUCKS, BUT I'LL RISK FOUR

1512
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:56,967
BUCKS."

1513
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,067
AND THEN, IF THAT PRODUCT ISN'T

1514
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:00,833
MADE WITH THE CARE THAT THE

1515
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,933
SMALL BREWERIES MAKE IT WITH,IT

1516
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,600
MIGHT TURN THAT CONSUMER OFF

1517
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,267
FROM EVER WANDERING TO THAT

1518
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,833
CRAFT SEGMENT OF THE STORE

1519
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,400

1520
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:09,933

BEER.

1527
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:21,033
SO, THE POPULARITY OF ORGANIC

1528
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,233
FRUIT PRODUCTS IS ON THE RISE.

1529
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,867
ORGANIC BEERS ARERELATIVELY NEW

1530
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:27,167
ON THE SCENE.

1531
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:28,667
&gt;&gt; Baron: HERE'S A COMPANY THAT

1532
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:30,100

[ HORN HONKING ]

1536
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,467
[ HORNS HONKING ]

1537
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:46,467
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

1538
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:46,900
&gt;&gt; SURE.

1539
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:48,100
&gt;&gt; Baron: DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE

1540
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,167
GREEN VALLEY BREWINGCOMPANY IS ?

1541
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,267
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

1542
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,600
&gt;&gt; I KNOW WHEREGREEN VALLEY IS,

1543
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:54,933
BUT NOT THE GREENVALLEY BREWING

1544
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,400
COMPANY.

1545
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:56,433
&gt;&gt; Baron: IS THERE ANOTHER

1546
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,267
BREWERY IN THIS TOWN?

1547
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:57,800
&gt;&gt; OH, YES.

1548
00:43:57,867 --> 00:43:58,933
&gt;&gt; Baron: WHAT BREWERY IS IT?

1549
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,600
&gt;&gt; BUDWEISER.

1550
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:00,533
&gt;&gt; Baron: BUDWEISER.

1551
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,400
&gt;&gt; ANHEUSER-BUSCH.

1552
00:44:01,467 --> 00:44:02,233
&gt;&gt; ANHEUSER-BUSCH.

1553
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,100
&gt;&gt; ANHEUSER-BUSCH.

1554
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,033
&gt;&gt; BUDWEISER -- THAT'S THE ONLY

1555
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:04,933
BREWERY I KNOW OF, AND THAT'S

1556
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,233
NOT LIKE A MICROBREWERY, WHICH

1557
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,533
SOUNDS LIKE WHATYOU'RE SPEAKING

1558
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:07,833
OF.

1559
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,600
&gt;&gt; Baron: MM-HMM.

1560
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:09,733
WILD HOP -- IT'S AN ORGANIC

1561
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,133
BEER.

1562
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,500
HAVE YOU HEARD OF IT?

1563
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:11,933
&gt;&gt; NO.

1564
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,267
&gt;&gt; Baron: IT'S LIKE AN ORGANIC

1565
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,367
BEER, AND IT SAYS ON IT

1566
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:15,433
"GREEN VALLEY BREWING."

1567
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
&gt;&gt; NO. I'M A BUD MAN.

1568
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:17,567
&gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS LIKE A

1569
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:19,033
MICROBREWERY TO ME BECAUSE IT'S

1570
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,200
NOT SOMETHING LARGE AND

1571
00:44:20,267 --> 00:44:21,100
CONGLOMERATE LIKE

1572
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:22,033
ANHEUSER-BUSCH.

1573
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,367
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE ANHEUSER-BUSCH

1574
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:24,467
BREWERY RIGHT OUT HERE,

1575
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:25,900
ABSOLUTELY.

1576
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:27,500
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THEY'RE OUT THAT

1577
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:27,900
WAY.

1578
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,633
&gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN GETON HIGHWAY 12

1579
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,633
AND GET TO BOTH JELLY BELLY AND

1580
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,633
BUDWEISER.

1581
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,433
&gt;&gt; Baron: MAYBE IT'SBEHIND THAT

1582
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,033
BANK.

1583
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,800
THIS IS THE GREENVALLEY BREWING

1584
00:44:44,867 --> 00:44:46,900
COMPANY?

1585
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:48,867
NO WONDER ANHEUSER-BUSCH DOESN'T

1586
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:54,167
PUT ITS NAME ON THE LABEL.

1587
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,800
&gt;&gt; LET'S POUR OURSELVES A

1588
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,400
WILD HOP HERE.

1589
00:44:57,467 --> 00:44:59,200
WE PROVIDE ORGANICBEERS FOR OUR

1590
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:00,967
BEER DRINKERS BECAUSE THEY TOLD

1591
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:02,633
US THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO

1592
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,333
THEM AND WE WANTED TO BE THERE

1593
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,000
WITH AN ORGANIC BEER THAT WE

1594
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:07,500
THOUGHT HAD ANHEUSER-BUSCH

1595
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:09,267
ATTRIBUTES OF CRAFTSMANSHIP AND

1596
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:10,133
QUALITY.

1597
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,067
THE COOL PART IS I GET TO TASTE

1598
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:12,800
THEM ALL.

1599
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,733
SO, MY INVOLVEMENT IS PART OF A

1600
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,367
BIGGER GROUP THAT DEVELOPS

1601
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:18,133
PRODUCTS AND THEN DETERMINES

1602
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,933
WHICH ONES ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO

1603
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,867
HAVE THE ANHEUSER-BUSCH NAME ON

1604
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:24,833
THEM.

1605
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,400
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A SMALL BREWER,YOU

1606
00:45:26,467 --> 00:45:27,533
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT

1607
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,867
ANHEUSER-BUSCH BECAUSE THEY'RE

1608
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:30,067
GONNA GO AFTER EVERY SINGLE

1609
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:31,433
NICHE, EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITY

1610
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,167
THEY CAN FIND.

1611
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:34,200
AND IF THEY HAVE TO HAMMER AWAY

1612
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:36,233
AT SOME LOCAL BREWER'S SHARE OF

1613
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,133
A MARKET IN PEORIA, ILLINOIS,

1614
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,167
WELL, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GONNA

1615
00:45:40,233 --> 00:45:43,267
DO.

1616
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,567
&gt;&gt; I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY THAT I

1617
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:47,833
LITERALLY WAS IN THE SHOWER IN

1618
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,033
THE MORNING, AND STREAMING ON

1619
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,267
ABC "GOOD MORNING" WHATEVER IT

1620
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,767
IS, "ANHEUSER-BUSCH TO LAUNCH A

1621
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,867
BEER WITH CAFFEINE."

1622
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,067
A CATEGORY KILLER IS A BRAND

1623
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,133
THAT IS CREATED TO LITERALLY

1624
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,767
KILL THE COMPETITION.

1625
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,700
MY INITIAL THOUGHT WAS,"THEY'RE

1626
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:07,000
JUST GONNA CRUSH ME."

1627
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:09,033
THEY WENT FOR IDEAS TO REALLY

1628
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,000
GAIN TRACTION, AND THEN THEY

1629
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:12,867
COME IN AND FORCE YOU OUT.

1630
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:14,167
THEY WANT A PIECE OF IT.

1631
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,100
THEY WANT A PIECE OFEVERYTHING.

1632
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:17,933
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A

1633
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,333
REPEATABLE MODEL THAT I CAN USE

1634
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,633
TO EXPAND INTO OTHER MARKETS.

1635
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,300
RAISING THE MONEY IS THE HARD

1636
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:26,500
PART.

1637
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:29,467
THERE IS NOT A DAY THAT I DON'T

1638
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:32,533
MAKE INTRODUCTIONSOF MYSELF AND

1639
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,867
MY COMPANY TO POTENTIAL

1640
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,067
INVESTORS.

1641
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:37,600
THEIR ISSUE IS THEY LOOK AT THE

1642
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:38,833
GIANTS, THEY LOOK AT THE

1643
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,367
BEHEMOTHS AND SAY, "HOW ARE YOU

1644
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:42,667
GOING TO COMPETE WITH THEM?"

1645
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,367
&gt;&gt; I THINK...

1646
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:46,167
&gt;&gt; MY KIDS ARE 10, 8, AND 5.

1647
00:46:46,233 --> 00:46:48,167
AND ALL OF THEM WERE BORN INTO

1648
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:49,467
THE BEER BUSINESS.

1649
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:51,067
I THINK THE EXAMPLE'S GREAT,

1650
00:46:51,133 --> 00:46:52,967
THAT YOU CAN -- YOU CAN BE

1651
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:54,900
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE.

1652
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:55,400
&gt;&gt; YAY!

1653
00:46:55,467 --> 00:46:56,833
&gt;&gt; WE BOUGHT THIS HOUSE WHILE

1654
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,333
SHE WAS STILL WITH BOSTON BEER.

1655
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,900
I RENOVATED IT WITH A WHOLE

1656
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:01,733
CREW, AND SO WE GOTA GREAT DEAL

1657
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,600
ON THE HOUSE.

1658
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:04,867
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE --

1659
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:05,933
EVERYTHING'S ON THE LINE.

1660
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,133
IT'S -- IT'S, YOU KNOW, SINK ORSWIM.

1661
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,833
IF THIS FAILS, WE WON'T HAVE

1662
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,033
THIS HOUSE ANYMORE.

1663
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,167
&gt;&gt; [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

1664
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:15,767
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, THE EARLY DAYS WITH

1665
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,300
BOSTON BEER WAS JUST SHE AND

1666
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,933
JIM, AND SOME OF THE STUFF THAT

1667
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,600
THEY PULLED OFF NO ONE HAD EVER

1668
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:21,367
DONE BEFORE.

1669
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:22,833
SHE WAS THE QUEEN OF BEER.

1670
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,500
SHE CREATED THE BEST-RUN SALES

1671
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:25,767
FORCE IN THE INDUSTRY.

1672
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,100
EVERYBODY KNEW HER.

1673
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:28,333
&gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONEROOT BEER IN

1674
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,300
THE FRIDGE, GUYS, SO SHARE IT.

1675
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:33,200
&gt;&gt; I HONESTLY THOUGHT THAT ON

1676
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,133
HER NEXT VENTURE IT WOULD HAVE

1677
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,333
BEEN EASIER.

1678
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,933
IT'S JUST BEEN SOFRUSTRATING TO

1679
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,133
SEE HER COME HOME AT2:00 IN THE

1680

MORNING AND BE UP AT7:00 AND ON

WHO ARE BARTENDERS WHO ARE

1684
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:50,667
TELLING HER WHAT SHE'S DOING

1685
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:51,167
WRONG.

1686
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:52,800
&gt;&gt; DID YOU GIVE THEM YOUR LUNCH

1687

1688
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:55,133

1695
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,233
BUT SHE SMILES AND AGREES AND

1696
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,767
SAYS, "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH," AND

1697
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:08,867
GETS RIGHT BACK ON.

1698
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:10,633

I MEAN, WE'RE JUST EXPERIENCING

1779
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,633

THEY DIDN'T WANT THE BREWERY

1796
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,667
ITSELF.

1797
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:13,200
WHAT THEY WANTED WAS THAT BRAND

1798
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:14,733
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE

SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED, POWER

2115

WAS GIVEN TO THE STATES, WHO

2116
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:08,667
THEN SPLIT THEMSELVES INTO

2117

2118
00:59:09,467 --> 00:59:11,167
SO, TODAY IN MOST STATES, THERE

2119
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:12,667

00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,867

2125
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:22,300
&gt;&gt; IN A LOT OF CASES, OUR

2126
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:23,467
WHOLESALERS ARE THE SAME

2127
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:25,200
WHOLESALERS FOR MILLER.

2128
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:26,600
WHAT'S HAPPENED INCREASINGLY

2129
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:28,267
OVER TIME IS THAT THE

2130
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:30,300
WHOLESALERS THAT DON'T SELL

2131
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,533
BUDWEISER, IN MANY CASES, SELL

2132
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,700
ALL THE OTHER BRANDS.

2133
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:36,733
&gt;&gt; FOR SMALL BREWERS, IF THERE

2134
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,667
ARE TWO DISTRIBUTORS, ONE OF

2135
00:59:38,733 --> 00:59:40,667
WHOM WON'T CARRY ANYTHING BUT

2136
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:43,200
THEIR BREWERY'SPRODUCTS AND ONE

2137
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:45,333
OF WHOM HAS A VERY CROWDED

2138
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,300
HOUSE, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

2139
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:49,500
GET INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

2140
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:51,333
&gt;&gt; THEANHEUSER-BUSCH NETWORK - -

2141
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,100
THEY ARE A DIFFICULT COMPETITOR

2142
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:54,700
BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY DEEP

2143
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:56,533
POCKETS AND THEY CANMAKE ALMOST

2144
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,767
ANYTHING HAPPEN.

2145
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,533
&gt;&gt; Baron: TODAY, 70% OF

2146
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,400
ANHEUSER-BUSCH DISTRIBUTORS

2147
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:03,167
CARRY ONLY THEIR PRODUCTS,

2148
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:05,200
EFFECTIVELY SHUTTING OUT SMALL

2149
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:07,667
PLAYERS.

2150
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:09,367
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINKANYBODY HAS THE

2151
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:10,867
POWER OVER THEIR WHOLESALER

2152
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:12,933
NETWORK THATANHEUSER-BUSCH HAS.

2153
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,300
I MEAN, IT'S THE HEART OF YOUR

2154
01:00:14,367 --> 01:00:14,833
BUSINESS.

2155
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,100
IF THE WHOLESALER'S NOT WITH

2156
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:17,433
YOU, YOU CAN -- YOU CAN STAND

2157
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,967
THERE AND BANG A BALL-PEEN

2158
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,700
HAMMER OFF YOUR THUMB ALL YOU

2159
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:22,433
WANT, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET

2160
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,100
ANY RESULTS.

2161
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:25,867
&gt;&gt; WHEN THAT SYSTEM BEGINS TO

2162
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:27,700
BREAK DOWN AND THAT MIDDLE TIER

2163
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:29,367
IS NOT AS INDEPENDENT AS IT

2164
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:31,067
SHOULD BE, THAT'S WHEN CRAFT

2165
01:00:31,133 --> 01:00:33,900
BREWERS HAVE CHALLENGES IN

2166
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:35,167
GETTING THEIR BEER TO THE

2167
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:35,800
CUSTOMERS.

2168
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:37,867
&gt;&gt; THE THREE-TIERSYSTEM CREATES

2169
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:39,733
A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL

2170
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,300
BREWERS, RETAILERS, AND

2171
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:42,500
CONSUMERS.

2172
01:00:42,733 --> 01:00:44,500
&gt;&gt; THIS SYSTEM HAS SERVED US

2173
01:00:44,567 --> 01:00:45,800
WELL FOR 70 YEARS.

2174
01:00:45,867 --> 01:00:47,700
SPRINGING FROM THE FAILURE OF

2175
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:49,767
PROHIBITION, WHATHAS EMERGED IS

2176
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,733
A VIABLE SYSTEM OF SAFEGUARDS,

2177
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,800
STATE AND LOCAL CONTROL,ORDERLY

2178
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:55,867
MARKETS, ANDTREMENDOUS CONSUMER

2179
01:00:55,933 --> 01:00:56,333
CHOICE.

2180
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,700
&gt;&gt; Baron: CLEARLY, IT WORKS FOR

2181
01:00:57,767 --> 01:00:58,800
THE BIG BREWERS AND BEER

2182
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:00,633
DISTRIBUTORS, BUT ISIT GOOD FOR

2183
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:01,367
CONSUMERS?

2184
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:03,567
&gt;&gt; I OFTEN LOOK AT IT IN TERMS

2185
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:06,300
OF -- IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR THE

2186
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:08,600
BEER DRINKER -- ACCESS TO THE

2187
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:10,500
BEERS THAT THEY LIKE.

2188
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:17,300
&gt;&gt; ♪ DO DO DO ♪

2189

2193
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:25,533
&gt;&gt; SO, HERE WE ARE, THE

2194
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,833
COUNTDOWN TILL BREW DAY.

2195
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,433
I THINK WE GOT ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

2196
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,100
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

2197
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:30,033
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PLAN.

2198
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,500
YOU CAN SEE THERE'STHE LAST FEW

2199
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:32,633
THINGS THAT HAVE TO COME

2200
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,200
TOGETHER.

2201
01:01:33,267 --> 01:01:34,800
SO, FINALLY WE GOT OUR BIG-BOY

2202
01:01:34,867 --> 01:01:35,467
BREWHOUSE.

2203
01:01:35,533 --> 01:01:37,000

01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:39,267
BREWHOUSE.

2206
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:40,767
RIGHT NOW, MYSELF AND -- I

2207
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,600
KNOW -- ALL THEBREWERS ARE JUST

2208
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:44,300
REALLY EXCITED TO GROW INTO A

2209
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,133
TRUE REGIONAL BREWERY,YOU KNOW,

2210
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,067
LIKE BEFORE PROHIBITION, WHEN

2211
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:50,333
THERE WERE, YOU KNOW,DOZENS AND

2212
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,433
DOZENS OF BREWERIES THAT WERE

2213
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,033
OVER 100,000 BARRELS.

2214
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,900
AND THAT -- THAT ERA, YOU KNOW,

2215
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:57,733
DISAPPEARED, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE

2216
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,667
OF THE GREATMARKETING SKILLS OF

2217
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:01,600
THE MILLERS AND THEBUDS AND THE

2218
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:03,300
COORS OF THE WORLD.

2219
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:04,700
YOU KNOW, I'M PROUD OF THIS

2220
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:06,267
100-BARREL BREWHOUSE, BUT I'M

2221
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:07,900
PROUD TO SAY MYBUDDIES AT STONE

2222
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:09,167
HAVE A BREWERY THIS BIG.

2223
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:10,967
MY BUDDIES AT NEW BELGIUM HAVE

2224
01:02:11,033 --> 01:02:13,767
ONE TWO OR THREE TIMES.

2225
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:15,367
THE CHALLENGE, AS YOU GROW, IS

2226
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:17,000
HOW CAN YOU KEEP YOUR IDENTITY

2227
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,300
SPECIAL, AND HOW DO YOU

2228
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,933
DIFFERENTIATE YOURSELVES FROM A

2229
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,367
BIGGER BREWERY ONCE YOU'RE

2230
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:23,033
BREWING ON THE SALE WE'RE ABOUT

2231
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,567
TO BREW ON?

2232
01:02:25,633 --> 01:02:27,000
THE GREAT THING IS I SEE ALL

2233
01:02:27,067 --> 01:02:28,300
THESE PEOPLE STEPPING UP.

2234
01:02:28,367 --> 01:02:29,633
THERE'S 100 PEOPLE AT THIS

2235
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,300
COMPANY WHO -- YOU KNOW, THEIR

2236
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:33,033
OWN JOBS ARE AT RISK IF WE DON'T

2237
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,767
MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

2238
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,833
THEY'RE AS AMBITIOUS AS I AM TO

2239
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:42,767
SEE THIS EXPANSION WORK.

2240
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:44,767
I WOULD HATE TO SEE A DAY WHEN

2241
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,633
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING

2242
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,733
HERE EVERY DAY NOLONGER HAD 51 %

2243
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,833
OF THIS COMPANY, NOLONGER COULD

2244
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,767
DECIDE TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING

2245
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:54,600
BECAUSE IF WE -- IF THAT DAY

2246
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:57,267
CAME, A BEER LIKE THIS, AT $150

2247
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,900
A CASE -- THAT'D BE THE FIRST

2248
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:00,833
THING THAT WOULD GO.

2249
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,667
I'M VERY WORRIED THAT WE'LL

2250
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:04,633
OUTGROW THE LOANS THAT WE JUST

2251
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,267
MADE.

2252
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,300
IF WE KEPT GROWING AT 40%, 50%,

2253
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,133
60% A YEAR, THE WAY WE HAVE

2254
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,667
BEEN, THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY

2255
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:12,200
MIND THAT WE WOULD NEED MORE

2256
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:13,900
MONEY TO EXPANDBEFORE I PAY OFF

2257
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:15,333
THIS $9 MILLION WORTH OF DEBT

2258
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,033
THAT I HAVE.

2259
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,533
WE'RE GETTING ALL THESE CALLS

2260
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,967
FROM VENTURE CAPITALISTS AND

2261
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:20,400
SUITS FROM NEW YORK WHO ARE

2262
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:21,833
LIKE, "OH, WOW, YOU GUYS ARE

2263
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,600
KICKING ASS.

2264
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,000
WE WANT TO TAKE YOU PUBLIC.

2265
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:25,200
WE WANT TO INVEST IN YOUR

2266
01:03:25,267 --> 01:03:25,767
COMPANY."

2267
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,633
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GROW AT THE

2268
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,533
RATE THATNECESSITATES US LOSIN G

2269
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,967
CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

2270
01:03:31,033 --> 01:03:32,867
AND THAT'S WHAT I WORRY ABOUT,

2271
01:03:32,933 --> 01:03:34,933
IS THAT SOME OUTSIDEFORCE WOULD

2272
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,867
BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, DETER US

2273
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:39,967
FROM OUR LABOR OF LOVE.

2274
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:41,867
&gt;&gt; Baron: HELLO!

2275
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,700
HOW ABOUT A TAXI?

2276
01:03:45,933 --> 01:03:46,900
HEY!

2277
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:48,433
TAXI!

2278
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,933
&gt;&gt; I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO

2279
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,400
YOU...

2280
01:03:50,467 --> 01:03:51,933
THE MONEY RAISING HAS PROBABLY

2281
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,500
BEEN THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART.

2282
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:56,533
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OFA CATCH-22.

2283
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,300
THE PEOPLE WITH THE MONEY ARE

2284
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,233
WAITING TO SEESOMETHING HAPPEN.

2285
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,733

STOP US FROM USING THE WORK

2806
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:26,833
"CHICORY" AND USING THE WORD

2807

"PUNKIN" ON OUR LABELING.

PURSUE YOUR PASSION?

2845
