And here I am, carrying your baby.

How do I know it's my baby?

Do you know what your problem is?

You've got a chip on your shoulder.

Is there anything you need?

I love being OFF Broadway!

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,933
Ladies and gentleman,

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,733
welcome to the first preview
of "Adam and Steve -

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,033
Just the Way God Made 'Em."

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,800
Before the show begins,

28
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:07,400
we need to let you know that
the show was rated "FLAMING"

29
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:10,033
by the Coalition of Christians.

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,533
But that doesn't mean
it's about homosexuals.

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,233
It just means,
that if you enjoy this show,

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,200
you'll end up burning in hell,
right next to us.

[applause]

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,800
Hi! I'm Adam.

35
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,733
And I'm his husband, Steven.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,733
And this is our story.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
In the beginning,

38
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,300
God created the Heavens
and the Earth.

39
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,300
Wait a minute!

40
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,433
That's not how it's supposed to begin.
You grabbed the wrong book.

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,200
Sorry.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,333
In the beginning,

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
God was... bored.

44
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,333
He was all alone in the universe,

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,533
and the thought of being alone
forever bothered Him.

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,033
He realized what he needed
were beautiful beings to entertain Him.

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,500
So, God created the angels.

48
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,400
And they were hot.

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,533
Each angel was hot and sexy

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,000
and male.

51
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,200
God loved the angels,

52
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,433
but soon realized
that He wanted more.

Every song you sing
has to be from a show

165
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,633
or from a songwriter
that has written a show.

166
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,933
Oh, actually you can sing
whatever you want

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
if you tip twenty dollars.
We don't care.

beginning Mostly Sondheim

my gorgeous co-host,

Kate Pazakis' gregarious,
fabulous vocal chords.

171
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,800
Gregarious?

172
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,100
I don't know. I just
made up the word.

173
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,733
So, hit it Jack!

You're gonna finally play

You're ready to go?

195
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,433
I'm ready for a lot of things.

196
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,967
Hmm,
I like the way that sounds.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,500
Look!

198
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:31,833
The homosexual lifestyle
is the biggest threat our nation has,

199
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,400
even more so than terrorism.

200
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,733
And they call themselves
Christians.

201
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,533
Didn't Jesus say

202
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,300
"Do to your neighbors as you
would have them do unto you"?

203
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,467
Well, that sounds
like a good philosophy.

204
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,033
-Wait!
-What?

205
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,700
No flood?
No lightning?

206
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:55,200
No wrath of God?

207
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:57,200
I guess He approves.

208
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,700
C'mon.

209
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,600

Honey, you've been
single forever.

215
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
If I were you I'd call
him a boyfriend

216
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,433
just so I could say
I had one this millennium.

217
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,333
It's not about having
a boyfriend.

218

It's about finding
the right one.

for you.

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,467
Hey Adam.
Look what I just made.

240
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,633
OK, now it's official.
You are a genius!

241
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,533
Oh you're too sweet.

242
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,433
Who would've ever thought
you could get

243
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,633
this awesome juice
out of a potato?

you made.

-They're hand blown!
-That has always been one of your specialties.

246
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,233
What about last night? You figured out
how to pull the skin back.

247
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,200
It's so much better that way.

248
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:43,633
I know, now I really like bananas.

249
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,533
Hey, I wonder if our kids
are going to be like us...

250
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,933
or like them.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,833
What do you mean?

252
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,533
How do we now if our kids are going
to be cultured and stuff?

253
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,200
Or like us?

254
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:59,033
Well, we'll just have to teach our kids
to be like us, that's all.

255
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,900
And tell them to stay away
from the garden.

256
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,900
Hey! Who are you?

257
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:13,033
Hi, I'm Adam and this is my husband Steve.

258
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,433
What's your name?

259
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,933
Cain.

260
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,433
Do you want a banana?

261
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,433
Mommy, can I eat Adam's banana?

262
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,233
Make sure you pull the skin back.

263
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,433
Stay away from them!

264
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,700
They're trying to convert our children.

265
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,100
That's how they plan to do it.

266
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,433
They don't have to go
through labor pains at all.

God doesn't like the gay people.

That's why he keeps them locked
up in the gated garden.

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,433

Hey.

327
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,667
Hi.

328
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,533
You're cute.

329
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,300
Thanks.

330
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,733
I'm just here to relax.

331
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I can help with that.

332
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,933
I'm actually seeing someone.

333
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,700
I'm not gonna tell him.

334
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,533
I'm not here to hook up.

335
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,633
C'mon,
just let me suck you off.

336
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,233
No!

337
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,600
Just leave me the fuck alone.

338
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,600
I tried to be nice but Christ!

339
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,000
Dick.

340
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,033
Can I talk to you about
something?

341
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,400
-Sure, what is it?
-My parents are coming to opening night.

342
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,933
-That's great!
-It is. I mean they've always been

343
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,633
so supportive, but I never expected them
to come all the way for this.

344
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,600
It is your first New York opening.
You shouldn't be surprised.

345
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,100
I know, but my parents
are very religious.

346
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,900
Oh, so do your parents know
what the show is about?

347
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,733
I told them it was "Adam and Eve
- The Way God Made 'Em".

348
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,100
Yeah, there gonna be surprised.

349
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,000
And they don't know
about me either.

350
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,367
This is gonna be good.

351
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,833
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm serious. I'm freaking out.

353
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,900
They wouldn't let us read Harry Potter,

354
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,000
because it was all magic
and against God.

355
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,133
Well if they think Harry Potter
is sacrilegious,

356
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,133
I cant wait to hear
their review of this show.

357
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,433
I try to be good, I don't have sex...

358
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,900
But you've had sex right?

359
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,133
What? Seriously?

360
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,533
I wanted to wait for the right guy.

361
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,833
But I don't really go out and meet people
so I never really found one.

362
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,000
Wow. But haven't you
ever been curious?

363
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,833
No.

364
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,033
Yes.
I don't know. Look!

365
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,633
Sex is the last thing on my mind
right now. What am I gonna do?

366
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,300
I wish I knew what to tell you.

367
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:47,100
My parents are gonna hate me.

368
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,100
No they're not.
It's all gonna be OK. Trust me.

369
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:51,133
Look, we gotta go.
We'll talk later?

370
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,133
Yeah.

371
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,000
Ok.

372
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:57,133
God I wish this wasn't happening.

373
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,433
And just as the prophecies foretold,
five thousand years later,

374
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,933
God put Adam and Steve back on the Earth
to prove their love was real,

375
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,700
and able to beat the obstacles
of the modern world.

376
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:09,233
They were put in different places,

377
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,333
and in homes that used the Breeder's
Informational Book of Living Examples.

for bringing me Patty Maye.

Now, do you know
what it is time for?

422
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,300
Well, I hope so.

423
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:07,933
It is time to hear about Jesus!

424
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,233
-Amen!
-But before...

425
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,833
I can tell y'all
about the word of the Lord,

426
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,133
I need to talk to you
about something very important.

427
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,500
My friends, partners
in my ministry,

428
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:23,333
we have fallen on hard times.

429
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Now, we want to express across
the world our message,

430
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,533
but, we are running out of money!

431
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,933
Now you know all
the money in your wallets

432
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,133
and in your bank accounts
and on your credit cards,

433
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,833
well, that is not your money!

434
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,300
That is God's money,

435
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,633
and God needs his money back!

436
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,833
Hallelujah!

437
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,833
And then last thing, just
at the end of "creation"

438
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,933
I want a sforzando on the "aah",

439
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,733
so just watch me,
it will be like "aaaaahh!"

440
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,933
Like that, yeah?

441
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,100
Yes.

442
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,433
Thank you so much.

443
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,633
Have a good second act.

444
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,500
Thank you.

445
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
So, what do you think I should do?

446
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,300
About what? Your parents
or your virginity?

447
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:07,133
What? Huh? What? You're a vir...

448
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,633
You'll have to excuse her. She's never had
to use that word before.

449
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,833
That is not true. I used to pray to Mary
and she was a vir-

450
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,900
-Are you really a virgin?
-This probably wasn't the best place

451
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,633
for this conversation.
-We can help you out with your virginity.

452
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,833
Oh, no you can't. Leave him alone.

453
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,200
I didn't mean it like that.
I meant come out with us tonight.

454
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:28,700
We know a lot of hot boys.
We can get you laid.

455
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,933
-Come out with us!
-I'm not trying to get laid.

456
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
Going out tonight might be good for you.
Take your mind off things.

457
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:36,900
Give you a chance
to clear your head.

458
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:39,200
And Sebastian and I will be there
to make sure these whores

459
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,633
don't put you on an express train to hell.

460
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,800
Are you calling me a whore?

461
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:46,133
If I wasn't sitting in this chair
right now,I'd take my...

462
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,300
But you are, Blanche!
You are!

463
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,867
To alcohol!

464
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,833
Go-go dancing.
I couldn't imagine doing that.

465
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,633
Is he for real?
Red panties.

466
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,500
I know, he has a zit
on his right butt cheek.

467
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,533
Alright, let's get him another.

468
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,900
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

469
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,933
Hey! Hey you! How you doing?

470
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,233
I've never been better.
This was such a good idea.

471
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,600
Are you sure? You seem pretty wasted.

472
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:49,033
You can call it "wasted',
I call it "free!"

473
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,800
Okay, just don't do anything stupid.

474
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:07,700
I'll show you guys dancing.

475
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,100
What is this?

476
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:14,367
No, no, no, no.

477
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,167
Alright, I am so over you
and your friends.

478
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Oh my God.

479
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,867
So good! Don't knock yourself out.

480
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,800
I think this is yours.

481
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,500
I have no idea how it ended up off of me.

482
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:11,733
May I help you put it back on?

483
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,833
You can help me do anything.

484
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,733
Oh really?

485
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,700
Yeah.

486
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,233
Not in front of my friends.

487
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
What?

488
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:29,800
We can't kiss in front of my friends.

489
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:31,233
You know you kissed me right?

490
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,400
Yeah, I know, but

491
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:35,367
we can't do this in front of my friends.

492
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,300
Do you want to go somewhere?

493
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:47,933
I've always wanted to go to Paris.

494
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,533
Well, for tonight, lets go to my place.

495
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,367
That will do for now.

496
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,900
Hey hold this,
I'll be right back.

497
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,433
Hey Eddie!

498
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,233
-Can I talk to you a minute?
-Sure, what's up?

499
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,033
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

500
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,633
Yeah, why?

501
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,533
I just want to make sure.

502
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,733
You and your newfound freedom.

503
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,733
You don't have to go home with anyone.

504
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,267
Yeah I know.

505
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,933
I wanna go home with him.

506
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
He's really hot.

507
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:32,600
Okay.

508
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:36,333
I appreciate it. Goodnight.

509
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,500
-Be safe.
-Uh huh.

510
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,300
I've never done this before.

511
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,600
Just relax.

512
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:08,100
Doesn't this feel good?

513
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,167
Yes.

514
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,633
Wait, shouldn't we get a con...

515
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Don't worry about it.

516
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:29,233
Do you do this a lot?

517
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,067
No, you're special.

518
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,000
-So, what happened to you last night?
-What do you mean?

519
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:42,533
Well, first you were drunk,
and then you were with that guy...

520
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,733
-Scott?
-Scott.

521
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,900
Did you do it?
Did you tap his little ass?

522
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:50,300
Well, he actually...

523
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,233
-No!
-What?

524
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,433
You bottomed for a bottom?

525
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,433
I don't even know what to say to that.

526
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,533
-But you were safe, right?
-What?

527
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,733
-You were safe, right?
-Safe?

528
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,800
When you had sex, you used a condom?

529
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:08,733
He doesn't have sex a lot.
He said it would hurt more if...

530
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,233
Are you serious? He's a slut!

531
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,033
Don't you ever have
unsafe sex again, you hear me?

532
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,133
Never! I don't care
who you're with.

533
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,133
You just met him, that's crazy!

534
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,400
-But he...
-Never have unsafe sex!

535
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,533
Ok?

536
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Yes. Fine.

537
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,133
Five minutes guys!

538
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,533
Thanks five.

539
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,100
So, what should I do
about my parents?

540
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,433
Well, whatever you do, don't tell them
a bottom banged you bareback.

541
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,100
I'm serious!

542
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,333
Look, whatever you do, whatever
you tell them, just...

543
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,833
make sure you do it
before they get here.

544
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,600
[text signal]

545
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:46,933
What the hell?

546
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,200
What's wrong?

547
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,500
Someone told Sebastian
that I was HIV positive.

548
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:58,700
Oh, that makes sense
now, all the safe stuff.

549
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,500
-I'm so sorry, I didn't...
-I'm not!

550
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,467
I'm not positive!

551
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:08,500
Benny, you know what
I think it's time for?

552
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,700
I think it's time to tell
all our Christian friends

553
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:14,900
just what's going on
in our own family right now.

554
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:17,100
Are you sure you're up
for it, Sugar Plum?

555
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,233
I'm strong.

556
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,233
Strong.

557
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,433
For Jesus!

558
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,567
That's my Patty!

559
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,733
I'm not sure if y'all know this or not,

560
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,833
but one of our very own singing angels
is my nephew, Steven.

561
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,000
My sister became a Catholic
for her husband,

562
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:40,033
and they have been raising Steven

563
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,300
as a Catholic!
-Oh Lord.

564
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,300
Jesus just told me
how much that hurt Him!

565
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,200
Now, a couple of weeks ago,
Steven came to me and he said,

566
00:32:55,267 --> 00:33:00,233
"Aunt Patty, I think there's something
you need to know."

567
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,700
Well, I clutched my heart and I said

568
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:06,633
"Please, dear Jesus. Let him tell me
he's leaving the Catholic Church!"

569
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Praise Jesus!

570
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,400
But no, he said, "Aunt Patty,

571
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:18,033
I am a hhh...homosexual."
-Homosexual!

572
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,833
Well, I fell to my knees and I said,
"No Jesus! No! He's become a priest!"

573
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,900
Oh no!

574
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,733
Well, thank Jesus,
he was not a priest.

575
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,400
But he was a hh...homosexual.

576
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:35,733
But at least that's a disease
we can cure him of.

577
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,833
Well, Benny and I talked to him,

578
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,900
and we read him parts of the Bible
where it says homosexuality is wrong.

579
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,300
God hates them.

580
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,233
Hates them!

581
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,633
And then, Jesus gave me my mission.

582
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,633
And Benny and I together
started a retreat program

583
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,533
to help those young homosexuals
on the straight path to Jesus!

584
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,933
-Good Lord!
-To scare that demon of homosexuality out of them!

585
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,233
-Praise Jesus!
-And we found a wonderful recovered homosexual

586
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,033
named Bruce Cohan,

587
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,533
not Cohen.

588
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,433
And he used to be a choreographer
on the Broadway

589
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,300
until he found Jesus.
-Yes indeed!

590
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:25,733
-And he will lead that retreat!
-Yes Lord!

591
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,433
Now part of your donations today

592
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,800
will go towards the "Foundation
Against Gayness Society."

593
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:39,333
Now, here's our nephew,
the reformed Catholic,

594
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,633
and soon to be reformed homosexual,
-Praise Lord!

595
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,967
Steven, to give his testimony.

596
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,267
-Praise Jesus.
-Praise Jesus.

597
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,933
This whole situation has been
very difficult for me.

598
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,533
You see,

599
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,633
I love the Lord,

600
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,700
but, I know He doesn't love me.

601
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,633
I know He doesn't want me to be gay.

602
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,000

until I stop being this way.

-It's ok.

656
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:04,600
Is it strange
that he's not calling me back?

657
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,867
Who?
Oh, thanks.

658
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,733
Scott.
He isn't calling me back.

659
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,433
What'd you think was gonna happen?

660
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,933
You met him. You had sex.
That's pretty much the end of it.

661
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,333
But I thought he liked me.

662
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,233
Eddie, it's not about liking you
or not liking you. It was just sex!

663
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,933
-But it was so special.
-It was just sex, trust me.

664
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,633
Just sex? So I should just go out
and have sex with people?

665
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,500
What the hell do I know?

666
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,500
Why does being gay
have to be this hard?

667
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:44,133
I don't know, but you can't
let this get you down.

668
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,100
You can't let this asshole hurt you.
You just have to pick up and move on.

669
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:50,500
Everything is gonna be OK.

670
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:53,133
And if you're looking
for more then sex,

671
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,000
you don't sleep with the guy
an hour after you met him.

672
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,067
I just feel awful.

673
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,000
And my butt still hurts.

674
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:02,400
I'm sorry.

675
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,633
As Homer Simpson so admirably put it,

676
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,233
"To alcohol, the cause of,
and solution to, all of life's problems."

677
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,567
So, what are you gonna do
about Sebastian?

678
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,133
Paul?

679
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,500
Yeah.

680
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,833
Hey!

681
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,633
Thanks for calling me back.

682
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,200
No, I'm fine.

683
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:08,633
I just have a lot on my mind
right now. A lot!

684
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,633
Look, I can't really talk right now.
I'm on my way to a dance class,

685
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,133
but I'll call you later.

686
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,767
Bye, love you.

687
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,833
Hey Sebastian, it's Paul.
Again.

688
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,333
Listen, I just got tested for you
and I'm negative.

689
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,900
We need to talk.

690
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,700
What are you writing,
your memoirs?

691
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:34,533
No, I'm just trying to get
my thoughts together.

692
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,200
You're OK?

693
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:40,333
Yeah, this whole Sebastian thing
is just freaking me out.

694
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,300
Oh, I got tested.
-And?

695
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:46,800
-I'm negative.
-Of course.

696
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:49,500
But no matter how safe you are, those tests
are just so nerve-wracking.

697
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,933
What did Sebastian say when you
told him you were tested?

698
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,133
Nothing. He hasn't even
called me back yet.

699
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,533
He's an asshole.

700
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,333
No, he's just confused.

701
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,500
No, he's an asshole.
You at least deserve a phone call.

702
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:03,333
You know, I try and look
for a healthy monogamous relationship,

703
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,333
or someone to spend
my life with,

704
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,633
but I always end up getting fucked.
And not in a good way.

705
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,633
That's why I don't do the love thing anymore.
It get's too complicated.

706
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,233
What you need is to get fucked...
and in a good way!

707
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,900
I want a husband, two point five kids,
a house in the Hamptons and a dog.

708
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:24,433
I don't wanna be a slut
like everyone else.

709
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,000
Are you talking about me?

710
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,533
Oh, I don't think the word slut
does you justice.

711
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,833
Bitch!

712
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,933
Whore!

713
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,933
Slut!

714
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh, you wish!

715
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:36,233
Look, if you wanna change,
then change.

716
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,533
If you don't,
then stop bitching about it!

717
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,733
It's just sex,
it doesn't have to be special.

718
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,933
It's just like working out.
But with someone else.

719
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,800
But I want sex to be special -
to mean something.

720
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:50,300
But why?

721
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,600
Imagine if you went to a theme park
and walked around

722
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,633
until you found
the perfect rollercoaster.

723
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,133
By the time you picked the right one,
the park would be closed,

724
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,633
and you wouldn't have gotten
to enjoy anything.

725
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,233
Sometimes you should just
shut up and enjoy the ride.

726
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,100
Cute analogy.

727
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:10,233
I am impressed.

728
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,633
Thanks.

729
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,033
Go on.
Be a slut.

730
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,933
Be a great big slut. Try 'Manhunt.'

731
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,900
I'm not going on 'Manhunt.'

732
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:26,433
Position?

733
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,400
Top.

734
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:32,500

Steve, why don't you get him a T-shirt?

Thanks.

learn our camp song.

what it's called,

832
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,033
all you have to do is look down
on your camp T-shirt.

Excuse me! I saw the show.
I just wanted to say hi.

867
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:53,533
-You saw the show?
-Yeah.

868
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,800
There's no way you could have seen it
and made it back here this fast.

869
00:50:56,867 --> 00:50:59,700
Oh, well, I saw the show last night,

870
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:02,133
but by the time I made it
to the stage door you'd already left,

871
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,800
so I came to meet you tonight.

872
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:06,800
Glad you liked the show.

873
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:09,033
You look familiar.

874
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,300
Oh, I go to Mostly Sondheim
once in a while.

875
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:15,833
Oh, cool! Well, make sure you say hi
next time you're at Sondheim.

876
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:21,733
Do you... think maybe we could grab a drink
or go for coffee or something?

877
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,000
I don't know. I have to run but,
I'm sure I'll run into you again soon, OK?

878
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,100
Hey!

879
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,833
So, how was your workout?

880
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,333
Fine, yours?

881
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,100
It was good.

882
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,000
So I was thinking,

883
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,267
maybe we could...

884
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,600
-You know what would be really hot?
-What?

885
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:25,300
Not you.

886
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,533
Do you want to take a walk?

887
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,933
OK.

888
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,633
But don't try anything.

889
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,667
I won't touch you I promise.

890
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:44,800
It's so beautiful here.
-I know.

891
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:48,133
Isn't it wonderful how God
has brought us here to help us?

892
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,833
Help us?
Help us what?

893
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,500
He should be helping us break out.

894
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,733
Are you OK? Is there a problem?

895
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,133
-Am I doing something wrong?
-Huh?

896
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,733
You haven't even tried to touch me.

897
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,800
-You just told me you didn't want me to.
-I thought you'd at least try.

898
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:10,733
I didn't take you here to molest you.
I just wanted to talk to you.

899
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,933
You're not even attracted
to me, are you?

900
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,033
I think you're absolutely adorable.

901
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,633
Then kiss me.

902
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,133
I want to know what its like.

903
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,933
You've never been kissed before?

904
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,133
No.

905
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,767
Just kiss me, please.

906
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,400
-I can't!
-Forget about the promise.

907
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:30,000
It's not about the promise.

908
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:32,333
It's about this fucked up place.

909
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,933
-We should get back.
-Why?

910
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Are we just hanging out so we can make out?
-No.

911
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:41,800
What else could we do?

912
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:45,800
Well, we could talk
about this sick place.

913
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:49,533
We can talk about who we really are.
We can talk about...

914
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,700
Sick? This place is here to help us become
who God wants us to be.

915
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:56,733
Yeah. You go on
and find out who that is.

916
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,733
I'm already what God
wants me to be.

917
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,600
And where are you going
tonight mister?

918
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:04,633
My first online date.

919
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,500
Oh look, our little boy's getting
all dressed up for a trick.

920
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:10,833
It's like he's growing up right before our eyes.
-Shut up!

921
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,000
I'd say good luck, but you know
these things are kind of a given.

922
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:17,533
-He's real hot too.
-Yeah, if he sent you a real picture.

923
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,833
-What do you mean?
-Don't listen to the bitter, dear. Just go

924
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,233
have fun, and give it to him
once or twice for me.

925
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,433
Goodnight boys.

926
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,433
Oh, thanks for the help
with the profile.

927
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,767
That's what slutty friends are for.

928
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,200
Where are my pants?

929
00:54:32,267 --> 00:54:34,133
Right here.

930
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,100
Thank you

931
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,933
Oh, hey! I guess we bumped
into each other after all.

932
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,700
Hey!
Nice to see you again.

933
00:54:46,467 --> 00:54:50,633
Yeah, I gotta go to work.

934
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,633
Hopefully we bump
into each other again.

935
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,200
Yeah sure.

936
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,700
Paul?

937
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,300
You look just like your picture.

938
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,200
I need a drink.

939
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,633
Cranberry vodka.
-Alright.

940
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,433
You're really cute.

941
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,800
Thanks!
I see you in here a lot.

942
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:29,233
I like the ambiance.

943
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,800
I bet you do.

944
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:33,500
I work down the block
in the show "Adam and Steve -

945
00:55:33,567 --> 00:55:35,800
Just The Way God Made'Em."

946
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:38,733
I hear it's great.
I'd love to see it.

947
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,233
I can get you comps. Give me your number
I'll call you tomorrow

948
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,633
and hook it up.

949
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,700
Yeah, that'd be great.

950
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:53,500
Let me know when you wanna...

951
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:54,533
cum.

952
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,100
Yeah.

953
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:57,333
What are you doing after work?

954
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,100
Huh?

955
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:02,033
-The change is your tip.
-Thank you.

956
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,833
I got a tip with your name all over it.

957
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,800
Thanks. I'm already taken.

958
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:10,433
Come on!

959
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,233
Come home with me, I'll fuck you
like you've never been fucked before.

960
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,633
Whoa Sparky, now you're getting
a little inappropriate.

961
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,700
Just give me another drink.

962
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:19,033
How about I give you
a little water?

963
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,133
Why don't you just give me
a little vodka?

964
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,733
Why don't you go home and sober up?

965
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,400
Why don't you just give me another
fucking drink? You know I know the owner.

966
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,300
Yeah, everyone knows the owner.

967
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:29,400
Just give me another fucking drink!

968
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,733
Are you fucking serious?

969
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,000
Go sober up.

970
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:29,200
Mom, Dad - I need to tell you something.

971
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:38,400
So, how does this usually start?

972
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:43,333
How do you want it to start?

973
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,900
This is all about you.

974
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:50,100
Umm...
Well...

975
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,433
Would you like me to undress for you?

976
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,700
Sure.

977
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,600
So, tell me about yourself.

978
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:08,600
Sure.

979
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:13,733
What would you like to know?

980
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,333
Where are you from?
Why do you do this?

981
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,833
Well, I'm from Washington.
Seattle, actually.

982
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:28,333
I go to NYU.
And this is how I pay for it.

983
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,233
Nothing crazy or anything.

984
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,300
Does your family know you do this?

985
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:35,033
No. They do know I'm gay though.

986
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,800
Are you seeing anyone?

987
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:38,033
Yes.

988
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,767
Does he know?

989
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,967
How would you like a massage?

990
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,200
Sure.

991
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:05,433
Isn't this whole thing
strange for you?

992
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,200
It was... at first.

993
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:13,333
And you probably end up
sleeping with fat old men.

994
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,967
Sometimes I get to sleep
with hot young guys like you.

995
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:23,333
Do you sleep
with hot young guys a lot?

996
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,100
A lot of young guys just don't wanna
deal with dating or meeting anyone.

997
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:32,933
And with me there is
no drama, you know?

998
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,533
No bitching, no nagging.
And what you see is what you get.

999
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,933
I don't care if you want me
to top or...

1000
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,967
if you want to fuck
the shit out of me.

1001
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,300
Do you kiss all your clients?

1002
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,200
Only the ones I want to.

1003
00:59:51,267 --> 00:59:53,300
Can I ask you a question?

1004
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,933
You sure are full of questions.

1005
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,067
I know this is strange but...

1006
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,900
can I hold you?

1007
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:10,300
I meant...

1008
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,800
cuddle, hold you.

1009
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:17,867

I didn't realize you were working here.

1018
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:10,400
I'm not having a good day.

1019
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:11,533
You wanna talk?

1020
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,900
Yeah.

1021
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:14,267
Let's go downstairs.

1022
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,333
What's wrong?

1023
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,533
I told my parents.

1024
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,533
-Did you tell them everything?
-Yeah.

1025
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,833
It didn't go well.

1026
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,333
What did they say?

1027
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,667
Nothing.

1028
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,333
They always say they love me
and they said nothing.

1029
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,833
I think my mom started crying.

1030
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,333
I could almost hear
their disappointment,

1031
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,600
hear their hearts break.

1032
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,733
They hate me.
-They don't hate you.

1033
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,033
It's tough for parents to hear
their kids are gay. It just takes time.

1034
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,700
I can't imagine being anything worse than gay.
-Don't say that.

1035
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:01,733
It's all going to be
OK, you'll see.

1036
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,600
No, it's not Paul.

1037
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:08,233
You always say everything's going
to be OK, but it's not.

1038
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,233
Sometimes its going to be horrible.

1039
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,133
Sometimes things turn out
to be disasters.

1040
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,733
You don't know what it's like
to have your parents hate you.

1041
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,733
You don't know what it's like
to disappoint the people who raised you,

1042
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,400
and gave you everything.
You don't know!

1043
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,500
I just wish there was a cure.

1044
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,533
Something I could take
to make me normal.

1045
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,400
Some pill. Some shot.

1046
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:37,600
You are normal Eddie. Why would you
wanna change who you are?

1047
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,900
You know what,
you should go see that show,

1048
01:03:41,967 --> 01:03:43,233
"Adam and Steve - Just the Way
God Made 'Em."

1049
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,433
It might help you out.

1050
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,033
Yeah, I hear the guy
playing Adam is a slut.

1051
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,833
I hear the guy who plays Steve
just popped his cherry.

1052
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,900
Paul, don't you ever
just wanna fit in?

1053
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:57,233
No, I never try to fit in.

1054
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,633
Could you imagine if I tried
to be like the people I grew up around?

1055
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,800
I'd be watching professional wrestling
and drinking beer out of a can.

1056
01:04:04,867 --> 01:04:06,933
A can, Eddie!

1057
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,400
For a date I'd buy
a nice box of wine,

1058
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:13,633
drive to a parking lot
to grab some girl's titties.

1059
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,900
I don't mind being different.

1060
01:04:15,967 --> 01:04:17,433
I like it.

1061
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,400
Because I know I'm better!

1062
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:21,400
This is me.

1063
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,533
Take it or leave it.

1064
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,400
How is being a slut
going for you?

1065
01:04:26,467 --> 01:04:27,200
Not too well.

1066
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:30,033
I even hired a hustler.

1067
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,867
Really?
Was it good?

1068
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:37,433
We cuddled.

1069
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,933
You hired a hustler and you
just cuddled with him?

1070
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,933
And you thought bottoming
for a bottom was pathetic.

1071
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,933
I know, Eddie.

1072
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,833
I'm just trying
to figure out who I am.

1073
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,400
And sometimes,
when everyone around you

1074
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:52,333
tells you you're supposed
to be something else,

1075
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,933
you start to think you are.

1076
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,300
So you don't think
you really wanna be a slut?

1077
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,400
I just wanna be loved.

1078
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,400
Do you think my parents
still love me?

1079
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,500
What do you think?

1080
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,767
You always make me feel better.

1081
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:14,600
It is gonna be OK.

01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:55,233
also my glands are swollen, and...

1102
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,433
If you're scared
you should go get tested. It's free.

1103
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,100
Do you think I might be?

1104
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:02,233
After just once? I mean,
wouldn't it be like a sign from...

1105
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,633
From what? God? Look,
HIV is a disease.

1106
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:08,233
It has nothing to do with
God or punishment.

1107
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,133
If God wanted us dead, he'd send down
the fires of Sodom and Gomorrah.

1108
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,100
Just go get tested.

Would you go with me?

1110
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,133
Of course. But you're gonna
owe me a drink.

1111
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,900
And next time wrap it up.

1112

God you're so stupid.

1113

We're about to pop
somebody's cherry everybody.

1115
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,733
We have a Mostly Sondheim virgin!

1116
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,300
Come on up Charles!

1117
01:08:41,967 --> 01:08:43,700
Well, umm

1118
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:50,433
I'd like to dedicate this song
to a special guy I keep bumping into.

1119
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,500
I don't really know
how to talk to him so...

1120
01:08:53,567 --> 01:08:58,000
I thought I would try talking
to him in his language - music.

1121
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:00,867
So I wrote this for him.

1144
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,900
really not looking to hook
up or anything.

1145
01:10:50,967 --> 01:10:53,533
Me neither.

1146
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,533
I just came out to my parents
and it didn't go very well

1147
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,933
so the last thing on
my mind is sex.

1148
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,433
I can't even imagine telling
my parents I'm gay.

1149
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,433
I'm Mormon.

1150
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,033
Is that worse than being
a Southern Baptist?

-Good. I'm fine,

1154
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,233
but they want me to come back
in a few months to do it again.

1155
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:37,633
-OK.
-Oh, I can't leave yet.

1156
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,800
They want to take me back and give me
a counseling session in a few.

1157
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:42,233
Teach me about safe sex.

1158
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,733
No problem.
I can wait.

1159
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,000
Thank you so much
for coming with me.

1160
01:11:48,967 --> 01:11:51,200
I'm glad you're OK.

1161
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,500
So...

1162
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,900
I met a cute boy last night.

1163
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:01,033
Oh, me too!

1164
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,600
Mine sang me a song.

1165
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,100
Mine's a Mormon.

1166
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,567
I think we're both
pretty damn pathetic.

1167
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,200
I think I like being pathetic.

1168
01:12:14,267 --> 01:12:17,200
Eddie, you wanna come back now?

1169
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,100
David?

1170
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,900
I can't believe we're doing this.

1171
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:06,400
We said we were going to be here.

1172
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:08,833
We can't miss
the biggest opening night of his life.

1173
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:14,033
Even if the whole show
just seems so wrong?

1174
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,900
I am just as troubled
by all of this as you are,

1175
01:13:18,967 --> 01:13:21,167
but he's still our son.

1176
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,933
Hey everyone.

1177
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,733
Now remember Patty has a new song
at the end of the show.

1178
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,600
I can't believe they're adding
a new song opening night.

1179
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,400
They don't call it off-Broadway
for nothing.

1180
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,133
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to opening night

1181
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,100
of "Adam and Steve - Just
the Way God Made'Em!"

1182
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:53,900
Before we begin, we must inform you
that the coalition of Christians

1183
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:57,200
has rated our show "FLAMING."

1184
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:59,933
This doesn't mean we condone or encourage
the homosexual lifestyle.

1185
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,600
It just means that
if you enjoy our show,

1186
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:05,900
You'll end up burning in Hell
right next to us!

1187
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:14,333
God? If you're listening,
we need some help!

1188
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,933
I'm frightened Adam, I'm frightened!

1189
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,033
We're lost in the woods and we don't know
where we're supposed to be going.

1190
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,700
Hello!

1191
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,033
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

1192
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,100
Why, I'm not a witch at all.

1193
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:35,333
I'm your guardian angel, Dorothy.

1194
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,100
An angel? Did God send you here
to bring us to Hell?

1195
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:43,733
No Dear. He sent me here
to bring you to New York City.

1196
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,733
New York City is God's favorite city,

1197
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,967
but you can't go there shirtless. Here!

1198
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,533
Wear these.

1199
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,433
Aren't they a little small?

1200
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,600
Trust me, Steve. It'll look divine!

1201
01:15:01,067 --> 01:15:03,067
These do look good.

1202
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,000
You look great.

1203
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:08,033
You too.

1204
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,333
Did you think I would steer you wrong?

1205
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,700
After all, you're both
friends of Dorothy now.

1206
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:15,033
Can I ask you a question?

1207
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,700
Of course Steve.

1208
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,933
Does God hate us because
we're gay?

1209
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,200

There are so many friends of Dorothy here.

1260
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,867
You know what this journey has taught me?
-What?

1261
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,900
That I want you in my life forever.

1262
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,900
Steve?

1263
01:19:28,067 --> 01:19:29,233
Will you marry me?

1264
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,833
Of course I will.

1265
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:36,333
No, no, no! You can't do this.
This is an abomination.

1266
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,333
The Lord God said that two men
should not sleep in the same bed.

1267
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,633
It is Adam and Eve,
not Adam and Steve.

1268
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,200
If God were here right now,
what would He say?

1269
01:19:47,267 --> 01:19:49,000
Why don't you just ask me?

1270
01:19:49,067 --> 01:19:50,633
Who are you supposed to be?

1271
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,200
What did they expect? God!

1272
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:58,500
The Father. The man upstairs.

1273
01:19:58,567 --> 01:19:59,567
Watch this.

1274
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,267
Let there be darkness.

1275
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,800
I said LET THERE BE DARKNESS!

1276
01:20:06,867 --> 01:20:08,833
Now watch this - my favorite part.

1277
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,900
Why the fuck is it so dark down here?

1278
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:19,933
If you are God, then you know
it's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.

1279
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,333
You shouldn't believe
everything you read.

1280
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,400
But your book specifically says...

1281
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,833
My book? Who said it was my book?

1282
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:32,300
What do you think,
I faxed it down here?

1283
01:20:32,367 --> 01:20:34,833
It was written by man.

1284
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,700
It was interpreted by man.

1285
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:40,533
It was abused by man.

1286
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,000
I never told people to hurt and kill.

1287
01:20:43,067 --> 01:20:44,700
I told everyone to love.

1288
01:20:44,767 --> 01:20:47,733
You mean, you love the gays?

1289
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,700
Didn't you just hear
the last song?

1290
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:53,200
Maybe we were wrong.

1291
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,433
I'm so sorry we tried to change you.

1292
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,200
Can you ever forgive us?
-Of course I can.

1293
01:21:02,267 --> 01:21:04,733
I love you both so much.

1294
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
I guess we were wrong.

1295
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,933

Is there anything you wanna
say to each other?

1331
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,233
You know, marriage is
a commitment of love.

1332
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:34,533
It's the binding together
of your two souls throughout eternity.

1333
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,900
Don't ever make this commitment
unless you sure you're ready.

1334
01:24:38,967 --> 01:24:42,733
You know I love you,
but are you ready?

1335
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,533
If not, I'm willing to wait.

1336
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,600
My whole life, I've wondered
what was wrong with me.

1337
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,500
The problem was
that I hated myself.

1338
01:24:51,567 --> 01:24:55,000
And it made me feel so alone.

1339
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:57,267
You will never be alone again.

1340
01:24:59,067 --> 01:25:00,633
You showed me how to love myself,

1341
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,833
and now I'm ready to love you.

1342
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,900

Thanks.

We are so proud of you.
