00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:44,933
BACK IN THE '80s AND '90s,
INFORMATION WAS KEY.

2
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,200
BUT NOW IT'S A WHOLE NEW GAME.

3
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,200
THESE DAYS, WITH THE INTERNET,

4
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:52,667
TWO FRESH GRADS SITTING
IN SOME SHIT WINDOWLESS BOX

00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,333
MIGHT BE PUSHING AROUND MORE MONEY

6
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
THAN SOME OF THE BIGGEST FUNDS,

7
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:58,933
AND GETTING INFORMATION
FASTER THAN ANYONE ELSE

8
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,200
BECAUSE THEY'RE MASTERS
OF A CHAT ROOM.

9
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:06,233
THAT'S WHY OUR JOB
IS NOT JUST ABOUT INFORMATION;

10
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,467
IT'S ABOUT INTELLIGENCE.

11
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,500
WHEN WE BUY A STOCK,

12
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:13,700
IT'S BECAUSE AN IDIOT
SOLD IT TO US.

13
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:15,500
AND WHEN I SAY US,

14
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:20,233
I DON'T MEAN THOSE PUSSIES
OVER ON WALL STREET.

15
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,900
HEDGE FUNDS, GENTLEMEN,
ARE THE FUTURE.

16
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:29,133
AND WE THRIVE NOT ONLY BY OUR ABILITY
TO DECIPHER THE CLUES,

17
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,367
AND READ BETWEEN THE LINES,
BUT BY DESIGNING FOOLPROOF PLANS

18
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:39,500
TO BE EXECUTED TO THE 'T'
BY SUPERCAPITALISTS.

19
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:45,233
WE ARE A SUPERIOR,
COVERT AGENCY OF OPERATIVES

20
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,833

TO MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU CAN
BEFORE YOU DIE.

23
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,167
WE WILL BEAR ARMS WITH OUR WORDS,

24
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,867
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY...

25

IMAGINABLE... AND UNIMAGINABLE.

27
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:15,867
BECAUSE WE CREATE EVENTS--

28
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:20,567
EVENTS TO UNLOCK
SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

29
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:26,033

311
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,767
I WASN'T NOTIFIED OF YOUR VISIT.

312
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,667
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO TROUBLE YOU
WITH SUCH TRIVIAL MATTERS, RICHARD.

313
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:36,000
BUT STANDARD PROCEDURE AT THIS COMPANY
IS FOR ME TO REVIEW ALL REPORTS FIRST.

314
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,767
GARY, NEXT TIME PLEASE INFORM ME
OF ALL SPECIAL GUESTS

315
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,000
BEFORE GIVING OUT PRIVATE INFORMATION.
YES, SIR.

316
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,000
SO WHEN WILL I RECEIVE THE REPORTS?
AT LEAST A MONTH.

317
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:47,267
A MONTH? I MEAN,
THEY'RE JUST SIMPLE REPORTS.

318
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:52,100
WHAT YOU MIGHT VIEW AS SIMPLE
MAY BE MORE COMPLEX TO OTHERS.

319
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,333
I CAN SEE THAT.

320
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,933
GLAD YOU'RE CLEAR.

321
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,633
ANITA, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
MARK DOESN'T LIKE SALT ON HIS EGGS!

322
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,167
SORRY, MA'AM.

323
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,500
A MONTH? WHAT'S THE HOLD UP?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD THIS!

324
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:07,933
SWEETIE, WHO'S THAT ON THE PHONE?

325
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,500
IT'S CONNER.

326
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,400
HEY, CONNER!

327
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,133
HI, JULIET.

328
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,833
NO. NO GIRLFRIEND.

329
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,667
Mark: LOOK, I DON'T CARE

330
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:19,933
WHAT THE HOLD UP IS, ALL RIGHT?

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,400
WE HAVE A 5% SHARE
IN THE COMPANY, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

332
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,700
WE CAN DO WHATEVER THE--

333
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:26,433
DADDY, CAN I HAVE A GLASS OF WATER?

334
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
YES, HONEY.

335
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,500
Conner: THAT DOESN'T SEEM
TO MEAN ANYTHING TO HIM.

336
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,633
ALL RIGHT. WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S GOT YOU DOWN ON BOTH KNEES...

337
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,667
SO WHILE YOU'RE DOWN THERE,
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HIM A--

338
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,067
LOOK, I JUST NEED MORE TIME, OKAY?

339
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,933
YEAH, FINE.

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,700
KEEP ME POSTED.

341
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,933
HEY, UH, CAN I GET A J.D. STRAIGHT UP?

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,233
MAY I?

343
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,233
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.

344
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,467
THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEAR.

345
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,033
AND WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

346
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,333
WELL, IT'S HONG KONG,
IT'S PRACTICALLY CHINA.

347
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,767
THEY CAN CHANGE THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
YOU DRIVE ON JUST LIKE THAT IF THEY WANT TO.

348
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,533
AND WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

349
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
THE STATES.

350
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:09,167
SO YOU DON'T THINK
THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS YOU THERE?

351
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,667
WE GOT A CONSTITUTION; FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

352
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:15,233
SO YOU DON'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT
USES MEDIA TO CREATE FEAR AND PANIC

353
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,100
SO YOU'LL STAY IN YOUR LITTLE BOX?

354
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,467
FEAR OF TERRORISM,
NATURAL DISASTERS, ILLNESSES?

355
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:22,233
I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE ABLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.

356
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,067
I'M CONNER. NATALIE WANG.

357
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:29,333
YOU SEEM TO KNOW
A LOT ABOUT POLITICS.

358
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,267
I STUDIED POLITICAL SCIENCE
AND NOW I JUST--

359
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,600
BUST PEOPLE'S BALLS, HUH?
DO PUBLIC RELATIONS.

360
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,100
AH, SO YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL
BALL BUSTER?

361
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:41,867
CAN I GET A GLASS OF RED WINE AND A COKE
OVER TO THAT TABLE OVER THERE? THANKS.

362
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,767
YOU'RE WITH THAT GUY?
NICE TALKING TO YOU, CONNER.

363
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,433
[grunts] LOVE IT! LOVE IT!

364
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,000
GIVE IT TO ME! LOVE THE ENERGY!

365
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,467
COME ON! UPPERCUTS! [grunts]

366
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,700
NICE, ONE MORE! [grunts])

367
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:01,067
HOW'S THE GUAN XI TODAY, BRO?

368
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,500
[speaking Cantonese]

369
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:03,800
[grunts]

370
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:06,367
DUDE, YOUR CHINESE SUCKS.

371
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,767
COME ON, WHAT'S EATING YOU?
WHAT'S THE SCOOP?

372
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,367
THE CEO'S SON.

373
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,867
AH, RICHARD CHANG!

374
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:14,633
HE'S GOT ALL THE DATA
UNDER LOCK AND KEY.

375
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,900
TYPICAL COCK-SUCKING FAMILY HIERARCHY.

376
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:19,633
[grunts] ALWAYS GETTING
IN THE WAY OF OUR MONEY.

377
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,200
[grunts] THE PRODIGAL SON,

378
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:24,433
TRYING TO WEAN HIMSELF
FROM THE FAMILIAL TIT.

379
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,000
ALWAYS TRYING TO PROVE THAT HIS COCK
IS BIGGER THAN HIS DADDY'S.

380
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:28,000
[grunts]

381
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:29,400
WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO?

382
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,100
[grunts]

383
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,667
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GOT?

384
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,900
EH? [chuckles]
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

385
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:57,267
IT'S PRETTY NICE.

386
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,733
OKAY. WE'RE TALKING HIGH-LEVEL QUAN XI.

387
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,733
RICHARD ALREADY HAS MONEY AND POWER,

388
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,267
BUT YOU CAN'T BUY HIM OUT.

389
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,800
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN TAKE
FROM HIM IS HIS RESPECT.

390
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:11,467
DO THAT, AND HE MAY JUST GIVE YOU
THE KEYS TO THE FEI & CHANG CASTLE.

391
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,433
[Quentin] LET'S GET YOU UP TO SPEED BECAUSE TONIGHT,

392
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,133
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING MANO Y MANO.

393
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,133
THE GAME DU JOUR IS BACCARAT.

394
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,767
IT'S SIMPLE. YOU CAN BET
EITHER BANKER OR PLAYER.

395
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,933
EACH SIDE GETS TWO CARDS.

396
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,933
ADD THEM UP, DROP THE FIRST DIGIT,

397
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,367
AND THAT'S A POINT.

398
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,833
CLOSEST TO NINE WINS.

399
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,167
IF YOU CAME HERE FOR ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE COMPANY--

400
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,367
NO, I JUST CAME TO PLAY SOME CARDS.

401
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,100
FINE.

402
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,733
FUN GAME.

403
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,467
GOD, YOU'RE SO AMERICAN.

404
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:34,233
I AM AMERICAN.

405
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,100
AND YOU WANT EVERYTHING RIGHT AWAY
AND YOU THINK YOU'RE ALWAYS RIGHT,

406
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,600
THAT YOU ARE ENTITLED
TO WHATEVER YOU WANT

407
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,967
AND YOU CAN TAKE AS YOU PLEASE,

408
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:47,867
WITH NO PATIENCE,
NO CONSEQUENCE.

409
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:51,100
YOU'RE THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND.

410
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:55,133
NO TIES TO FAMILY,
OR OF HERITAGE NOR TRADITION.

411
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,267
YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING,

412
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:01,633
WHEN YOU HAVE
NO UNDERSTANDING OF ANYTHING.

413
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,267
[men chanting]

414
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,500
YEAH!

415
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:09,067
[applause]

416
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,767
WANT TO GO AGAIN?

417
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,200
YOU BET.

418
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,567
[woman giggles]

419
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,400
[sighs]

420
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,133
[door opens]

421
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,700
[laughing]

422
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:35,633
WHOA. WINNER WINNER,
DIM SUM DINNER.

423
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,167
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

424
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:40,733
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
GO WAIT OUTSIDE. COME ON.

425
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:48,033
WHAT HAPPENED?

426
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,033
I JUST LOST A HUNDRED THOUSAND. OW.

427
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,267
EVERY TIME I BET, HE JUST BETS
AGAINST ME AND WINS.

428
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,167
RELAX. YOU CAN DO THIS, BRO.

429
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,267
YOU EVER PLAY BOTH SIDES BEFORE?
WHAT?

430
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,267
LOOK, FIRST YOU BET
BOTH PLAYER AND BANKER.

431
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,533
FORCE HIM TO DECIDE.

432
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,100
AFTER HE'S CHOSEN,

433
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,033
YOU BET THE REST
OF WHAT YOU HAVE AGAINST HIM.

434
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,933
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WHAT ABOUT THE TREND?

435
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,667
FUCK THE TREND. PLAY WHAT YOU HAVE
IN FRONT OF YOU.

436
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:14,733
SHAKE IT UP. LIVE A LITTLE.

437
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,800
YOU REALLY SHOULD
JUST GIVE UP NOW.

438
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:28,400
AND SPOIL ALL THE FUN?

439
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:35,200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

440
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,167
BEING AMERICAN.

441
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:39,300
WELL, PLEASE, BY ALL MEANS,

442
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,767
KEEP PUMPING YOUR AMERICAN DOLLARS
INTO OUR ECONOMY.

443
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:45,233
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
WE LET YOUR KIND IN HERE.

444
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,433
HOW ABOUT WE MAKE THIS INTERESTING?

445
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,900
I WIN; YOU GIVE ME THE NUMBERS
I NEED TO DO MY JOB.

446
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,067
I LOSE...YOU LOSE...

447
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:07,900
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE
THAT I DON'T ALREADY OWN?

448
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:11,233
I LOSE;
ME AND MY AMERICAN DOLLARS GO HOME.

449
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,267
DEAL.

450
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,833
PLAYER WINS.

451
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,400
[sighs]

452
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,333
NO HARD FEELINGS.

453
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:13,900
YOUR INTENTIONS BETTER BE
AS GOOD AS YOUR LUCK.

454
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:26,500
YEAH. NO, HE'S DOING GOOD.
HE'S DOING REALLY GOOD.

455
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:29,300
OH, HEY I GOTTA GO.

456
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,367
DID IT WORK?

457
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:34,567
YEAH, BRO.

458
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:36,700
REALLY?

459
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:37,967
YES, REALLY.

460
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,333
[laughs] DAMN!

461
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,533
I GUESS WE GOT
SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE.

462
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,933
[laughs]

463
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,900
[dialing]

464
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,767
[ringing]

465
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,767
WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

466
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:57,167
Conner: ALL RIGHT.
SO, RETAIL OUTLETS SEEM FINE.

467
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:58,567
SOME FACTORIES ARE LOSING MONEY,

468
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,167
BUT IT SEEMS
THE IMPORT/EXPORT BUSINESS

469
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:01,567
HAS SOME SERIOUS CASH FLOW ISSUES,

00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:37,100
I DON'T DRINK

725
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:24,833
ESSENTIALLY WE'RE DILUTING THE NUMBER
OF SHARES CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET.

726
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,867
WHEN WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES,
THE STOCK PRICE GOES DOWN.

727
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:29,867
SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

728
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:33,333
I SHOULD INCREASE
THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE

729
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,067
IN ORDER TO HURT
THE SHARE PRICE?

730
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:38,567
EXACTLY! AND WHEN
THE STOCK PRICE GOES DOWN--

731
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:39,800
HE LOSES MONEY.

732
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:42,167
HELL, EVERYBODY LOSES MONEY,

733
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,733
AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM.

734
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,367
LOOK, I KNOW THESE HEDGE FUND GUYS.

735
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:49,800
AS SOON AS THE STOCK PRICE
GOES DOWN, HE'LL LIQUIDATE.

736
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:52,333
AND IF I DO THIS, WHAT ARE MY RISKS?

737
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,667
RISK? YOUR LEADERSHIP
WOULD BE HIGHLY QUESTIONED!

THAT YOU ARE TALKING TO THIS GUY!

FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

750
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:25,967
YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY DOWN
THOSE DEBTS WE DISCUSSED.

751
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:29,533
THIS JUST GIVES YOU ALL
THE MORE REASON TO DO SO NOW.

752
00:42:31,267 --> 00:42:33,200
I UNDERSTAND.

753
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:42,000
SO WHERE DID IT ALL GO WRONG?

RIDING ON THIS TRADE.

790
00:45:08,633 --> 00:45:11,433
IF I GO DOWN, YOU GO DOWN.

791
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,300
GET IT DONE.

792
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:17,433
HEY, THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

793
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,867
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT, CONNER?

794
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:20,733
WELL, WITH ALL THE PRESS
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON,

795
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,433
I JUST THOUGHT WE SHOULD TALK.

796
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,533
TALK? YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW

797
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,100
AND THEN AFTER HAVE A DRINK
OR TWO UP IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM?

798
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:31,400
YEAH, I'M SORRY, NATALIE. I WISH WE MET
UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.

799
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:34,300
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES
WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED ANYTHING.

800
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,733
SO YOU GOT ME ALL FIGURED OUT, HUH?

801
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,000
YOU ASSUME I'M THIS MONSTER.

802
00:45:41,067 --> 00:45:43,900
YOU THINK ANY OTHER FUND'S GONNA
TREAT YOU ANY DIFFERENTLY?

803
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:45,767
IF IT'S NOT ME,
IT'S GONNA BE SOMEBODY ELSE.

804
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,033
THAT IS SO IRRESPONSIBLE.

805
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,967
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT GOT US
INTO THIS MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

806
00:45:51,033 --> 00:45:54,400
FOR SOMEONE THAT ACTS LIKE
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING, THAT IS YOUR BEST ANSWER?

807
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:57,400
LOOK, I TRIED, NATALIE, OKAY?

808
00:45:57,467 --> 00:46:00,300
AND I'M THE GUY JUST TRYING
TO MAKE A PAYCHECK.

809
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:02,100
AT WHAT COST?

810
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,400
ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES, CONNER.

811
00:46:05,467 --> 00:46:08,567
I'D AT LEAST RESPECT YOU
IF YOU OWN UP TO YOUR OWN CHOICES.

812
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:13,267
I'M JUST TRYINGTO DO THE BEST I CAN
IN THE BEST WAY I KNOW HOW.

813
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:15,000
YEAH, I'M SURE.

814
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:17,800
CONVINCE ME. CHALLENGE ME.

815
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:20,867
COME ONE, MAKE ME UNDERSTAND FOR ONCE.

816
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:22,567
DON'T JUST WRITE ME OFF
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

817
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:24,133
WELL, HOW DO I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU?

818
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,867
HOW DO I KNOW THAT ANYTHING I SHOW YOU

819
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:28,633
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE AGAINST ME?

820
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:33,533
WELL, FIRST OF ALL...

821
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,500
YES, I DID GO TO AN IVY LEAGUE COLLEGE.

822
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,767
WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH A PROFESSOR,

823
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:42,333
I HAPPENED TO PROVE HIM WRONG.

824
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,333
SO HE FLUNKED ME.

825
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,133
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN YOU.

826
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,133
IF YOU'VE GOT A SOLUTION THAT MAKES SENSE, I'LL LISTEN.

827
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:56,233
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.

828
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,733
BUT IF I LET YOU IN ON IT,
IT'S GONNA CHALLENGE YOUR VIEWS,

829
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,667
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO MAKE A DECISION.

830
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:06,867
I CALLED YOU, REMEMBER?

831
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:11,100
LOOK, IF YOU GOT SOMETHING
THAT MAKES SENSE,

832
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,167
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK UP.

833
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,500
OKAY, I'LL SET UP AN APPOINTMENT.

834
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:21,967
GREAT.

835
00:47:22,033 --> 00:47:24,367
WE SHOULD REALLY ORDER.

836
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:26,567
YEAH, GREAT.

837
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:27,967
I DON'T...

838
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:31,100
YES, I KNOW. I FORGOT. YEAH.

839
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:32,533
USELESS.

840
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,100
GIZZARDS, LUNG, INTESTINE.

841
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:39,367
CLOTTED BLOOD.

842
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:41,900
ALL RIGHT, YOU ORDER.

843
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:43,967
[speaking Cantonese]

844
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:50,400
[Natalie laughs]

845
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,833
SO, UH, THANKS FOR SHOWING ME THAT SPOT.
FOOD WAS DELICIOUS.

846
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,500
WELL, THERE'S MORE TO HONG KONG
THAN WHAT YOUR PALS SHOW YOU.

847
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:00,200
MAYBE I NEED A NEW PAL.

848
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:02,133
NICE TRY, CONNER.

849
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,267
NO, I THINK AS WORKING COLLEAGUES,
IT'S GOOD WE ESTABLISH--

850
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:06,600
WAIT, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
THIS IS A FIRST DATE, RIGHT?

851
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:08,133
WE'RE NOT WORKING COLLEAGUES.

852
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,933
DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK, CONNER.

853
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,533
WELL, I'M GLAD WE FINALLY MADE PEACE.

854
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,333
OR SO YOU THINK.

855
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,400
NO, WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN, CONNER.

856
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:27,600
WELL, THIS IS ME.
THANKS FOR WALKING ME HOME.

857
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:29,000
MY PLEASURE.

858
00:48:29,067 --> 00:48:31,767
YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO,
BUT THANK YOU.

859
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:33,533
I WANTED TO.

860
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,533
GOODNIGHT, CONNER.

861
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,233
GOODNIGHT.

862
00:48:41,467 --> 00:48:46,167
HEY, THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID, OKAY?

863
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:48,833
I WILL. I PROMISE.

864
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:09,233
[speaking Cantonese]

865
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,233
HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

866
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,933
[speaking Cantonese] WHAT?

867
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:21,400
YOU SHOULD GO BACK
TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

868
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:23,267
[speaking Cantonese]

869
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,933
[speaking Cantonese]

870
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,400
[hits wall]

871
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,567
AH, MR. LEE. THANK YOU
FOR COMING TO SEE ME.

872
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,200
LET'S JUST GET THIS OVER WITH.

873
00:49:51,267 --> 00:49:54,000
I TAKE IT YOU'VE DECIDED
TO MAKE THE CHANGES?

874
00:49:54,067 --> 00:49:57,700
YOU KNOW, YOU NEARLY HAD ME CONVINCED.

875
00:49:57,767 --> 00:50:00,700
AND THEN I REALIZED SOMETHING.

876
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:04,067
AND IT ALL BECAME VERY CLEAR TO ME.

877
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:07,367
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW MY COMPANY?

878
00:50:07,433 --> 00:50:08,833
INHERITED THE COMPANY
FROM YOUR FATHER,

879
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,433
MADE ACQUISITIONS IN THE '80s,

880
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,833
WENT PUBLIC IN 1992.
YES.

881
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:17,233
AND I BET YOU CAN TELL ME HOW MANY WORKERS
I HAVE,HOW MANY FACTORIES I HAVE,

882
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,233
WHAT MY TOTAL REVENUE WAS LAST YEAR.

883
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:24,833
25,320 WORKERS, 30 FACTORIES,1.7 BILLION.

884
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,700
AND YOU THINK YOU KNOW MY COMPANY

885
00:50:27,767 --> 00:50:30,433
BECAUSE YOU READ A REPORT.

886
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,367
MR. LEE, LOOK OUT THERE.

887
00:50:34,433 --> 00:50:36,033
THOUSANDS OF CONTAINERS.

888
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,033
BEYOND THE CONTAINERS
ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

889
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,833
IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO LEARN

890
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,633
THAT IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT MATTERS,

891
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,833
IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT MAKES A BUSINESS A SUCCESS,

892
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,933
NOT IDEAS.

893
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,367
IT'S THE PEOPLE WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT.

894
00:50:56,433 --> 00:51:00,233
WITH THE AMOUNT OF SHARES YOU NOW HAVE

895
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,133
COMES THE POWER TO WIELD
THAT MIGHTY SWORD.

896
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,367
THAT SWORD CAN UNITE
OR DESTROY MY COMPANY.

897
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:13,967
MR. LEE, I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU...

898
00:51:14,033 --> 00:51:17,300
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

899
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:24,767
HEY.

900
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,467
HEY.

901
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:27,833
THANKS FOR COMING.

902
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,433
A PROMISE IS A PROMISE.

903
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,000
Natalie: UNCLE? WE'RE HERE!

904
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:02,433
HI, NATALIE! HI!

905
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,000
HOW ARE YOU?

906
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:07,800
AH, THIS MUST BE THE INFAMOUS MR. LEE.

907
00:52:07,867 --> 00:52:09,100
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

908
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,800
CONNER, THIS IS MR. CHAU, V.P. OF TECH.

909
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,167
WELCOME, WELCOME.

910
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:15,900
AND I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY MET KELVIN.

911
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,533
[roars]

912
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,400
LETS SHOW HIM
WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON.

913
00:52:20,467 --> 00:52:23,600
OKAY, LET GET THINGS SET UP.
COME ON, HAVE A SEAT.

914
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:25,600
HELLO, LITTLE MAN.

915
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:26,900
[speaking Cantonese]

916
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:29,367
SO, UH, WHAT KIND OF GAME
YOU GOT THERE?

917
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:31,200
OH! IT'S AN ONLINE GAME. IT'S REALLY FUN.

918
00:52:31,267 --> 00:52:33,467
SEE, YOU CAN BUY COMPANIES
AND SELL COMPANIES.

919
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:37,333
AND YOU CAN USE THOSE MONEY
THAT YOU EARN TO BUY OTHER COOL STUFF.

920
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,333
LIKE BOATS, CARS, AND HOUSES.

921
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,933
THE MORE MONEY I EARN,
THE HIGHER MY STATUS.

922
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,533
WELL, I GOT A GAME FOR YOU.

923
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,933
YEAH?

924
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,400
READY? ROCK, PAPER... SCISSORS!

925
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:48,833
[chuckles] YOU KNOW THIS GAME.

926
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,067
ALL RIGHT. YEAH.

927
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,933
Both: ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!

928
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,933
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!

929
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,733
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!

930
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,600
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!

931
00:52:57,667 --> 00:52:58,833
YES, GOT YOU! OH!

932
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,700
OKAY, I'M ALL SET.

933
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:01,933
HERE, HAVE A SEAT.

934
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,800
ALL RIGHT.SEE...

935
00:53:05,867 --> 00:53:08,033
RICHARD AND NATALIE AND I'VE BEEN WORKING
FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS

936
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,033
ON THIS NEW SUPPLY CHAIN
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

937
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:15,467
YOU KNOW, I MODELED THE WHOLE SYSTEM
AFTER KELVIN'S GAME OVER THERE.

938
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:18,067
SO GIVE EACH EMPLOYEE
MORE INCENTIVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE

939
00:53:18,133 --> 00:53:19,733
FOR THEIR OWN SHIPMENTS AND CONTAINERS...

940
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,967
IN A FUN AND EASY FORMAT.

941
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:25,233
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GUYS
TOLD ANYBODY ABOUT THIS?

942
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,067
WELL, IT WAS RICHARD'S IDEA,

943
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:30,367
BUT DONALD HASN'T REALLY LISTENED
TO RICHARD FOR A WHILE NOW.

944
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:32,633
DAD, CAN MR. LEE STAY FOR DINNER?

945
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,367
AH, YOU READ MY MIND!

946
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:35,933
OH, WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY--

947
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,333
WE'D LOVE TO.

948

HEY.

THIS IS NICE.
YOU'RE REALLY DOING IT RIGHT.

952
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:43,900
WELL, IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO GET IT.

953
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:49,467
WORKING ALL THE TIME...
FOR WHAT? FOR MONEY?

954
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:55,733
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
ONE COULD ASK FOR IN THIS LIFETIME?

955
00:54:57,233 --> 00:54:58,933
AM I INTERRUPTING ANYTHING?

956
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,033
OF COURSE NOT.

957
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:08,100
UM, IN FACT, I NEED TO GET IN
AND GET SOMETHING CHECKED ON.

[both chuckle]

959
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:20,300
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU MIND ME ASKING,
BUT WHAT WERE YOUR PARENTS LIKE?

960
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:23,300
DAD DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT.

961
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:27,567
MOM TOOK CARE OF ME
THE BEST THAT SHE COULD.

962
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:31,567
MY DAD WAS A TRADER
ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.

963
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:35,800
USED TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME HERE, THOUGH.

964
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:40,933
ONE DAY, HE JUST NEVER CAME BACK.

965
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,067
HOW ABOUT YOUR MOM?

966
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:47,067
SHE HATED THE STATES.

967
00:55:47,133 --> 00:55:51,167
WHEN I TURNED 18, SHE JUST MOVED AWAY.

968
00:55:51,233 --> 00:55:52,600
HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE.

969
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:55,933
DO YOU MISS HER?

970
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,400
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW
YOUR MOM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

971
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:06,900
IT MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD
FOR YOU TO COME BACK HERE.

972
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:11,300
AND AFTER ALL THIS,
YOU STILL DECIDED TO BECAME A TRADER.

973
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,333
HE USED TO LOVE TO GAMBLE.

974
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,067
HE USED TO GAMBLE
AT THIS LOCAL MAHJONG PARLOR IN CHINATOWN.

975
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:21,867
HE USED TO SAY,

976
00:56:21,933 --> 00:56:24,933
[deep voice] "IF YOU AREN'T GAMBLING,
YOU AREN'T LIVING."

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,200
[deep voice] YES.

[both laugh]

981
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:38,500
THAT'S ALL I HAVE LEFT OF HIM.

982
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:40,867
IT'S A WORN OUT PIECE OF PLASTIC...

983
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:45,067
BUT IT GIVES ME PEACE.

984
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,867
I THINK THIS IS WHAT HE
WOULD'VE WANTED, YOU KNOW.

985
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:55,533
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?

986
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:00,567
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

987

WHAT'S UP, ANDY?

999
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,700
LISTEN, MAN,
I WAS FILLING ORDERS THE OTHER DAY

1000
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:36,933
WHEN I NOTICED SOME SHORT POSITIONS
OUT OF NOWHERE ON YOUR TRADE.

1001
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
WHO RUNS THE SHORTS OUT THERE?
QUENTIN. BUT HE WOULDN'T--

1002
00:58:40,067 --> 00:58:43,933
THEY'RE ALL COMING FROM AN ASIA TRADING DESK
THROUGH AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT.

1003
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,200
YOU HAVE ANY PROOF?

1004
00:58:46,267 --> 00:58:48,267
I CAN'T BE SURE. I MEAN...

1005
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:51,033
I'D HAVE TO RUN OUR IN-HOUSE RECORDS
WITH THE RECORDS FROM FEI & CHANG.

1006
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,400
FEI & CHANG? YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO GET ANY INFORMATION OUT OF FEI & CHANG?

1007
00:58:54,467 --> 00:58:55,967
CONNER, THIS IS LARGE.

1008
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:59,400
LOOK, MAN, WHEN I ADD UP
ALL THE SHORTS,

1009
00:58:59,467 --> 00:59:01,400
THE POSITION IS A BILLION U.S.

1010
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:03,667
OUR POSITION IS 200 MILLION.

1011
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:06,400
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT SOMETHING
IS DEFINITELY GOING DOWN OUT THERE,

1012
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:08,467
AND THE STOCK PRICE IS A LIKELY CANDIDATE.

1013
00:59:08,533 --> 00:59:11,200

HEY, UH, I DIDN'T KNOW
THIS WAS A GROUP LUNCH.

OH, MICHAEL AND I WENT TO PENN TOGETHER.

SO YOU'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR A LONG TIME?

BUT JUST BUMPED INTO EACH OTHER AGAIN.

1026

I GUESS EVERYBODY'S MOVING OUT HERE NOW.

1027

1031
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:48,500
MUST BE NICE TO BE IN THE KNOW.

1032
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:50,267
IT IS. IT WASN'T
ALWAYS LIKE THIS, THOUGH.

1033
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:52,700
FIRST TIME I CAME IN HERE,
THIS PLACE WAS A COMPLETE SHITHOLE.

1034
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:55,100
NO ENGLISH ON THE MENU FOR WESTERNERS,
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

1035
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:59,433
TALKED TO THE OWNER, COMPLETELY STUBBORN ASSHOLE
WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.

00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,833

THREW SOME ELBOWS, MADE SOME CHANGES.

ABOUT THE CHANGES IN THE MENU?

COME ON, TABLOIDS!
ARE YOU USING ME?

THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK FOR YOURSELF.

LOOK AT YOU. EVERYDAY YOU GO OUT THERE,
YOU PLACE BETS, YOU TAKE RISKS,

YOU LUCK BOX.

1266
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:57,567
GET OFF ME.

1267
01:18:57,633 --> 01:19:00,433

WE NEED TO TALK.

1270
01:19:04,233 --> 01:19:06,433
TALKING IS SO BLASé.
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

1271
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,167
YOU AMERICAN'S LOVE TO TALK.

1272
01:19:08,233 --> 01:19:10,900
LOOK, RICHARD--

1273
01:19:10,967 --> 01:19:12,700
NO, YOU LOOK.

1274
01:19:12,767 --> 01:19:16,433
YOU WANT TO STAY, THEN PUT
YOUR BLOOD MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS.

1275
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,500
FINE.

1276
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:22,000
AH, NOW DOESN'T THAT
FEEL MUCH BETTER?

1277
01:19:23,233 --> 01:19:28,633
MONEY, WEALTH, FORTUNE.

1278
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,900
CONNER, WHO CARES?

1279
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:35,033
YOUR WESTERN PHILOSOPHY

1280
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:40,067
IS THE ONE WITH THE MOST TOYS WINS.

1281
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:42,467
BUT CAN'T YOU SEE?

1282
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:47,767
NOT THIS TIME, MR. AMERICA. NOT THIS TIME.

1283
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:49,833
WE ALL LOSE!

1284
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,833
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN EYE TO EYE,
BUT I CAN HELP YOU.

1285
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,200
I JUST NEED TO MATCH THESE RECORDS
WITH YOUR FINANCIAL DATA

1286
01:19:56,267 --> 01:19:59,867
TO GET EVIDENCE ON WHO IS MAKING
SHORT TRADES ON YOUR COMPANY.

1287
01:19:59,933 --> 01:20:03,533
AND WHY SHOULD I LISTEN TO YOU NOW?

1288
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,667
SUDDENLY YOU CARE
ABOUT HELPING MY COMPANY?

1289
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:07,667
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR COMPANY.

DON'T YOU EVEN SAY HIS NAME!

YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

1297
01:20:55,967 --> 01:20:59,833

I'M NOT GOING IN THE CLOSET!

GETS THEIR OWN ACCOUNT,

1420
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:43,600
ONE WHERE THEY CANNOT ONLY

1421
01:29:43,667 --> 01:29:47,000
KEEP TABS ON ONE ANOTHER,
SHARE WORK ITEMS,

1422

BUT GETS DAILY POINTS
FOR THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE.

1423
01:29:49,433 --> 01:29:52,867
AND AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER
THEY CAN TRADE IN THOSE POINTS FOR GIFTS,

1424
01:29:52,933 --> 01:29:55,667
OR GAMBLE IT AWAY
FOR EVEN HIGHER REWARDS.

1425
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,300
ONLY A VIDEO GAME. MAKES NO SENSE.

1426
01:30:00,367 --> 01:30:03,567
NO SENSE TO SOMEONE
WHO'S NEXT IN LINE TO BE CEO.

1427
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:11,167
SEE, THAT WAS THE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE
THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND--

1428
01:30:11,233 --> 01:30:15,500
HOW MICHAEL AND QUENTIN WERE GOING
TO CONVINCE YOU TO TAKE THE POISON PILL.

1429
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:18,033
AND IT TOOK RICHARD HERE
TELLING ME HOW MUCH

1430
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:21,333
OF AN AMERICAN I AM FOR ME TO REALIZE.

1431
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,600
SEE, I TAKE EVERYTHING AT FACE VALUE,
BELIEVE WHATEVER I'M FED.

1432
01:30:24,667 --> 01:30:27,767
MARK SAW THAT IN ME AND THAT'S WHY
HE SENT ME OUT HERE.

1433
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:31,367
YOU ARE DOING EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING.

1434
01:30:31,433 --> 01:30:32,900
TO SHAKE IT UP A LITTLE.

1435
01:30:32,967 --> 01:30:36,100
HE THOUGHT I COULD BE BOUGHT.

1436
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:37,633
SO, SHORT POSITIONS,

1437
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:40,633
FROM INSIDE FEI & CHANG
FROM OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS--

1438
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,367
ACCOUNTS THAT ARE LINKED TO VICTOR.

1439
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:45,100
QUENTIN TOLD US EVERYTHING.

1440
01:30:47,467 --> 01:30:49,433
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!

1441
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,267
WHY'D YOU KILL MR. CHAU, VICTOR?

1442
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:59,633
WAS IT BECAUSE HE WAS BUILDING THE SYSTEM
THAT WOULD EXPOSE YOU? HMM?

1443
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:05,300
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE YOU FINALLY REALIZED
YOU WOULD NEVER BECOME CEO.

1444
01:31:05,367 --> 01:31:07,233
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1445
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,800
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ALL ABOUT FAMILY, VICTOR.

1446
01:31:09,867 --> 01:31:11,133
I CAN'T STAND THIS!

1447
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:14,700
WHY'D YOU KILL MR. CHAU, VICTOR?

1448
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,700
WHY'D YOU KILL MR. CHAU, VICTOR?
NO.

1449
01:31:18,767 --> 01:31:22,133
WHY DID YOU KILL HIM? HUH?
HE HAD A SON!

1450
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,200
WHY DID YOU KILL MR. CHAU?!
WHY DID YOU KILL HIM, HUH?!

1451
01:31:25,267 --> 01:31:27,700
I DID IT FOR THE FAMILY!

1452
01:31:34,267 --> 01:31:39,467
THE COMPANY WAS BEING
RUN DOWN TO THE GROUND.

1453
01:31:39,533 --> 01:31:43,267
YOU THINK A LITTLE COMPUTER GAME
WAS GOING TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS?

1454
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:46,533
NO!

1455
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:51,067
THIS COMPANY NEEDS REAL LEADERSHIP!

1456
01:31:51,133 --> 01:31:54,833
I LOVE WHAT FATHER LEFT TO US

1457
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:59,333
TOO MUCH TO SEE IT FAIL!

1458
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:05,467
I DID IT-- I DID IT FOR THE FAMILY.
I DID IT FOR THE FAMILY!

1459
01:32:05,533 --> 01:32:08,833

01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,533

01:32:39,933 --> 01:32:41,300
NATALIE, CAN YOU--

1463
01:32:41,367 --> 01:32:42,700
I'M ON IT, MR. CHANG.

1464
01:32:42,767 --> 01:32:44,133
THANK YOU.

1465
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,800
SO, CONNER, LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW
MY COMPANY BETTER THAN I DO.

1466
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:56,567
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

1467
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,800
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SON.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

1468
01:33:07,867 --> 01:33:10,067
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER DOUBTED YOU.

1469

1472
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,400
HEY, CONNER.

1473
01:33:54,467 --> 01:33:55,900
SURPRISED TO HEAR FROM ME?

1474
01:33:55,967 --> 01:34:01,667
WELL, I ALWAYS SAID
YOU HAD YOUR FATHER'S EDGE.

1475
01:34:01,733 --> 01:34:03,467
IT'S OVER.

1476
01:34:03,533 --> 01:34:05,767
OH, NO, IT'S NOT OVER, KID.

1477
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:07,433
IT'S JUST POSTPONED.

1478
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,433
I KNOW ABOUT YOUR POSITIONS
IN FEI & CHANG.

1479
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,167
I KNOW THAT YOU WERE
THE ONE TO SET ME UP.

1480
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:15,267
OH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I WAS SETTING YOU UP!

1481
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:18,933
I WAS SETTING YOU UP FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,
YOU UNGRATEFUL SHIT!

1482
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,067
I WAS GONNA BRING YOU IN!

1483
01:34:22,133 --> 01:34:25,067
I WAS GIVING YOU EVERYTHING!

1484
01:34:25,133 --> 01:34:29,800
YOU GAVE ME NOTHING AND NOW
YOU'VE LOST IT ALL.

1485
01:34:29,867 --> 01:34:33,633
I BUILT THIS FUND FROM NOTHING,
I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

1486
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,933
YOU WANNA BET?

1487
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,800
THE SFC ARE INVESTIGATING.

1488
01:34:38,867 --> 01:34:41,667
QUENTIN AND VICTOR-- CONFESSING.

1489
01:34:41,733 --> 01:34:44,433
MARK, YOU'RE FINISHED.

1490
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:48,000
I GUESS I BECAME THE MAN
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AFTER ALL.

1492
