      <p begin="00:00:14.800" end="00:00:18.067">CHRISTIAN MEULI: I saw the cityin the deep, deep distance,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.133" end="00:00:20.567">that was dark green, and allthese lights flickering</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.633" end="00:00:22.667">and clouds flowing over it.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.733" end="00:00:25.733">And this all started aftertremendous geometric patterns</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.800" end="00:00:29.867">that are incredibly rapid thatyou can't describe to anybody,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.933" end="00:00:31.767">they're so fast.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.833" end="00:00:32.633">After those had slowed down,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.700" end="00:00:35.833">I saw this city in thedeep distance.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.900" end="00:00:38.867">So I was sort of watching that,and then this ball of light</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.933" end="00:00:40.933">goes right past me,right in front of me.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.000" end="00:00:41.933">What was that?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:45.467">It didn't scare me,except it was so close.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.533" end="00:00:47.633">After that I started lookingaround, and it's like you are</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.700" end="00:00:51.633">in this place, and then you'regoing "Why am I in this place?"</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.700" end="00:00:54.500">Then I noticed that there wasthis woman off to my right,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.567" end="00:00:58.900">with a real long nose,she had green skin.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.967" end="00:01:01.467">She was turning this dial,and I realized she was turning</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.533" end="00:01:06.800">the volume of lights up and downon the city, in the distance.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.867" end="00:01:10.100">And as soon as I looked at her,she noticed I was watching her,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.167" end="00:01:12.367">and she said "What elsedo you want?"</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.433" end="00:01:16.667">And I said, "What elsedo you have?"</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.667" end="00:01:38.533">JOE ROGAN: This is the storyof DMT, or dimethyltryptamine.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.600" end="00:01:40.933">A simple compound foundthroughout nature,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.000" end="00:01:45.333">which has profound effectson human consciousness.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.400" end="00:01:47.500">DENNIS MCKENNA: One of thethings, besides what it does,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.567" end="00:01:52.433">one of the things about DMTthat always fascinated me was</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:56.633">the fact that it's sucha simple molecule.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:01:59.600">DAVE NICHOLS: DMT standsfor dimethyltryptamine.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.667" end="00:02:01.933">Nn- dimethyltryptamine.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.633">If you actually look at thering structure of DMT itself,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.700" end="00:02:09.367">you only have really fourpositions that you can</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.433" end="00:02:11.033">attach things to.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.100" end="00:02:13.833">So you can make diethyl,or dipropyl.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.900" end="00:02:16.467">There are some other types ofcarbon chains you can attach</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.533" end="00:02:20.867">to that end that do give youcompounds that have activity,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.933" end="00:02:25.167">but very different from DMT.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.233" end="00:02:30.233">DR. MCKENNA: Biosyntheticallyit's two steps from tryptophan.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.300" end="00:02:34.267">Right, two trivial enzymaticsteps from tryptophan.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.333" end="00:02:39.533">Well tryptophan is an amino acidof course, and it's everywhere,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.600" end="00:02:44.567">so all organisms havetryptophan, and all organisms</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.633" end="00:02:50.767">have the two key enzymes thatlead to the synthesis of DMT.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.833" end="00:02:53.600">These enzymes are veryancient enzymes;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.667" end="00:02:55.200">they're all over the place.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.267" end="00:02:59.200">They're again part of basicmetabolism, so theoretically,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.267" end="00:03:03.767">anything could synthesize DMT.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.067" end="00:03:10.300">GRAHAM HANCOCK: DMT isastonishingly widely available</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.367" end="00:03:13.367">in plants and animals allaround the world, but so far,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.433" end="00:03:18.133">nobody really knows why it'sthere, or what its function is.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.200" end="00:03:22.133">DR. MEULI: That's the 64billion dollar question.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.200" end="00:03:24.633">Why is DMT in our bodies?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.700" end="00:03:26.800">Why is it in plants?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.867" end="00:03:29.033">And all sorts of mammals?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.100" end="00:03:32.733">And what is the roleit plays in humans?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:32.800" end="00:03:36.200">DR. MCKENNA: The conventionalwisdom 30 to 40 years ago was</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.267" end="00:03:38.133">that these things hadno real function.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.200" end="00:03:42.033">They were sort of physiologicalnoise, but that's very</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.100" end="00:03:45.000">na&#239;ve understanding.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.067" end="00:03:49.000">What we now understand is thatthese secondary compounds are</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.067" end="00:03:52.233">in a sense the languageof plants.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.300" end="00:03:55.267">These are messenger molecules.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:55.333" end="00:03:59.667">This is what plants use tomediate their relationships</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.733" end="00:04:02.833">with other organismsin the environment.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.900" end="00:04:05.167">CHARLES GROB: Why is it thathuman being's central nervous</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.233" end="00:04:09.867">system are wired toreceive this experience?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.933" end="00:04:15.967">Must be that there's importantinformation to be learned.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.033" end="00:04:18.833">HANCOCK: So, I don't think it'suniversally present in nature</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:20.133">by accident.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.200" end="00:04:21.367">It has a real function.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.433" end="00:04:23.767">We have co-evolved with theseplants, there's a purpose</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.833" end="00:04:25.633">and a meaning to it.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.067" end="00:04:32.267">LEANNA STANDISH: So it reallyfits in with the notion that</p>
      <p begin="00:04:32.333" end="00:04:38.900">DMT may be the common molecularlanguage, resonate language,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.967" end="00:04:41.767">among all living beings -</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.833" end="00:04:45.400">on this planet and maybeothers as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.467" end="00:04:49.467">I can't think of a morepowerful tool to explore</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.533" end="00:04:53.867">the whole question of"what is consciousness?"</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.467" end="00:05:00.100">RALPH METZNER: These substancesare tools that can be used to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.167" end="00:05:04.000">expand awareness in all areas oflife, and apply that expanded</p>
      <p begin="00:05:04.067" end="00:05:08.733">awareness for the bettermentof peoples' lives.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:08.800" end="00:05:12.900">In their community, theirfamily and our society.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:18.333">JEREMY NARBY: The good news isthat there's a growing number</p>

      <p begin="00:05:22.600" end="00:05:26.200">artists, movers and shakers,filmmakers, and so on</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.267" end="00:05:31.533">who realize that this stuff isall too interesting to go on</p>

      <p begin="00:05:34.167" end="00:05:36.333">And meanwhile, the inquisitionwas a long time ago,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:38.667">the birth of rationalismwas a long time ago.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.733" end="00:05:42.167">At this point, there is no goodreason, apart from bad habit,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.233" end="00:05:44.400">to keep up these barriers.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45.300" end="00:05:47.133">ROGAN: With the help of twoconcepts that are</p>

      <p begin="00:05:52.500" end="00:05:57.267">reintroduce psychedelics backinto the cultural dialogue.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.333" end="00:06:01.367">ALEX GREY: DMT, the SpiritMolecule, it's a conundrum,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.433" end="00:06:02.567">it's a paradox.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:02.633" end="00:06:08.867">The spirit is the inner world,the molecule is the external</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.933" end="00:06:14.867">world, so the psychedelics,or entheogens, take us from</p>

      <p begin="00:06:19.567" end="00:06:22.100">RICK STRASSMAN: I was drawn tothe pineal gland, which is a</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.167" end="00:06:25.967">very small organ in the centerof the brain, which has</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.033" end="00:06:28.900">always been an object ofinterest, and even veneration</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.967" end="00:06:33.800">for a lot of esoteric,physiological disciplines.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:33.867" end="00:06:38.967">I thought I wasn't totallycrazy to presume a pineal site</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.033" end="00:06:43.600">of origin for DMT, which fitin nicely with my theory</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.667" end="00:06:46.500">that the pineal was somehowinvolved in naturally</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.567" end="00:06:48.767">occurring mystical states.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:53.200" end="00:06:56.400">JOEL BASKT: This hypothesisproposes that the pineal gland,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56.467" end="00:07:01.433">at certain times, it's underspecific stress or stimulation</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.500" end="00:07:07.500">it releases a significantamount of this hormone DMT.</p>

      <p begin="00:07:40.033" end="00:07:41.767">and near-death experiences.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.833" end="00:07:45.233">I had this theory that therewas a big similarity between</p>

      <p begin="00:07:53.433" end="00:07:56.767">That's one of the originalfindings that led me to start</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.833" end="00:08:00.500">looking for a spirit molecule,for a compound in the brain</p>
      <p begin="00:08:00.567" end="00:08:05.067">that elicited mysticalexperience.</p>

      <p begin="00:08:37.067" end="00:08:41.533">These hallucinatory phenomenonare explainable by the presence</p>
      <p begin="00:08:41.600" end="00:08:44.733">of compounds that are known toproduce hallucinations,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:47.133">and the only compounds that weknow of that are capable of</p>

      <p begin="00:08:55.800" end="00:08:57.900">ANDREW NEWBERG: When thinkingabout spiritual states,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.967" end="00:09:01.433">I think endogenoushallucinogenic compounds</p>
      <p begin="00:09:01.500" end="00:09:04.533">and molecules that the braincan potentially release</p>
      <p begin="00:09:04.600" end="00:09:08.833">are probably very relevant tothis topic because on one hand</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.900" end="00:09:11.533">they may really help us toelucidate what is the</p>
      <p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:13.867">neurochemical mechanismof these experiences.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.933" end="00:09:18.133">I mean if we can say that thereis a release of endogenous</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18.200" end="00:09:20.767">opiates or we can say thatthere's a release of dopamine</p>
      <p begin="00:09:20.833" end="00:09:23.767">or something like that andwe can measure that release</p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.833" end="00:09:27.167">and we can see where in thebrain those different molecules</p>
      <p begin="00:09:27.233" end="00:09:30.333">go, what receptors theyactivate or deactivate,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.400" end="00:09:33.267">and hence we can really learna lot more about what these</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.333" end="00:09:37.167">experiences are because itreally can allow us to match up</p>

      <p begin="00:25:40.333" end="00:25:43.567">In order to answer that questionDr. Strassman conducted the</p>

      <p begin="00:25:47.833" end="00:25:50.900">DR. STRASSMAN: One of the thingsthat I had established early on</p>
      <p begin="00:25:50.967" end="00:25:57.300">was being able to discriminatebetween studies in the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:57.367" end="00:26:00.600">scientific realm andrecreational use, but in the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00.667" end="00:26:04.500">early 1980's I reviewed all ofthat literature and could pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:26:04.567" end="00:26:08.900">well establish on that if peoplewere really carefully screened</p>
      <p begin="00:26:08.967" end="00:26:11.800">and supervised and thenfollowed up that the incidents</p>
      <p begin="00:26:11.867" end="00:26:16.100">of adverse reactions to LSDand related psychedelics drugs</p>
      <p begin="00:26:16.167" end="00:26:17.933">was extremely low.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:19.233" end="00:26:22.433">The drug or the compound or thechemical that seemed like the</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22.500" end="00:26:28.133">best candidate to sort ofreopen the U.S. front on</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.200" end="00:26:30.900">psychedelic researchwould be DMT.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.500" end="00:26:35.733">DR. NICHOLS: It was really,it was exciting for me because</p>
      <p begin="00:26:35.800" end="00:26:39.633">this was the first study in ageneration and not only that</p>
      <p begin="00:26:39.700" end="00:26:42.733">despite the fact that DMT hadbeen used safely and in earlier</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42.800" end="00:26:44.833">studies and it was this naturalcomponent of the brain,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:44.900" end="00:26:48.733">DMT is one of the most profoundand potent psychedelics known.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:48.800" end="00:26:52.533">So, it wasn't just an initiationof clinical research it was a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:52.600" end="00:26:56.300">reinitiation of clinic researchwith an extremely potent drug.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:56.367" end="00:26:59.233">I was of the strong opinion thatyou could do these studies</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59.300" end="00:27:00.467">and Rick agreed.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.533" end="00:27:03.467">So, we had a number ofdiscussions and at some point</p>
      <p begin="00:27:03.533" end="00:27:06.967">the discussion came up, you knowDave what if I do all this paper</p>
      <p begin="00:27:07.033" end="00:27:10.467">work and spend all this time andget to the end of things and I'm</p>
      <p begin="00:27:10.533" end="00:27:13.867">ready to go and I can't getthe DMT, and that was a real</p>
      <p begin="00:27:13.933" end="00:27:17.033">possibility because DMT,clinical grade DMT wasn't a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:17.100" end="00:27:19.633">chemical you could just buy offthe shelf somewhere, and I told</p>
      <p begin="00:27:19.700" end="00:27:22.767">Rick if you get to that pointand no one will make it then</p>
      <p begin="00:27:22.833" end="00:27:28.333">I'll do it, and ultimately Rickgot to that point and I made it.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:28.400" end="00:27:29.767">DR. STRASSMAN: The designof the study was fairly</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.833" end="00:27:33.500">straight forward, give peopleDMT and measure as many</p>
      <p begin="00:27:33.567" end="00:27:35.600">variables as possible.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:35.667" end="00:27:39.100">I had to sort of anticipate alot of objections that would</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39.167" end="00:27:43.000">come my way from the regulatoryagencies that oversee</p>
      <p begin="00:27:43.067" end="00:27:44.800">this kind of research.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44.867" end="00:27:49.700">So that point began a two yearprocess of dealing with not that</p>
      <p begin="00:27:49.767" end="00:27:53.267">many regulatory agenciesbut fairly monolithic ones.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:53.333" end="00:27:56.867">One sort of you knowsatellite of the protocol</p>
      <p begin="00:27:56.933" end="00:28:01.500">was the involvement of apsychiatrist from U.C.L.A.</p>

      <p begin="00:28:15.067" end="00:28:17.833">DR. NICHOLS: And the main thingthat Danny Freedman told Rick,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.900" end="00:28:21.300">told us, was don't even getclose to psycho therapy.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.367" end="00:28:24.133">Forget about treating mentalillness or alcoholism</p>

      <p begin="00:28:29.067" end="00:28:31.633">You're a scientist Rick,approach it as a scientist.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.700" end="00:28:34.100">Do basic simple measurements,look at heart rate,</p>

      <p begin="00:28:39.967" end="00:28:43.033">Rick did what he said but thenhe still was able to get these</p>

      <p begin="00:28:53.100" end="00:28:56.733">the spin off that reallymade it interesting.</p>
