      <p begin="00:13:38.400" end="00:13:41.433">and um, it was justsupposed to be topless,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:41.500" end="00:13:44.567">and it, was, itwas really scary.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:44.633" end="00:13:45.533">Um--</p>
      <p begin="00:13:48.300" end="00:13:49.467">It was weird.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49.967" end="00:13:52.667">Well ever since I, sinceI got into the business,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:52.733" end="00:13:55.667">I always got emails,that said that you,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:55.733" end="00:13:57.400">you don't lookquite comfortable,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57.467" end="00:13:59.967">and I think that itwas the innocence,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:00.033" end="00:14:04.433">that, attracted my,a lot of my fans,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04.500" end="00:14:06.933">is that I didn't look totallycomfortable in anything I did,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07.000" end="00:14:08.533">and even if I wasspeaking I didn't look</p>
      <p begin="00:14:08.600" end="00:14:10.800">totally comfortable and Inever looked confident,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:10.867" end="00:14:13.867">I wasn't very verbal,I wasn't, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:13.933" end="00:14:17.333">over the top with thenoises or anything, um.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17.400" end="00:14:23.000">I dunno, I just started feeling,really depressed about it.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:23.067" end="00:14:23.933">Honestly.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:27.733">And, then I hitrock bottom myself,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:27.800" end="00:14:30.833">emotionally, where Ium, got really upset</p>
      <p begin="00:14:30.900" end="00:14:34.467">and I'd go in the bathroomand I threw a glass</p>
      <p begin="00:14:34.533" end="00:14:37.833">on the ground and thenI um, just crying</p>
      <p begin="00:14:37.900" end="00:14:42.267">and fall to the groundand just started like,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:42.333" end="00:14:44.533">pounding my wrists intothe glass, and blood was,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:44.600" end="00:14:46.800">just started goingeverywhere, and...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:50.533">I dunno, I justkinda lost that hope.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:50.767" end="00:14:53.433">I did have a stalker,um, he started off</p>
      <p begin="00:14:53.500" end="00:14:54.900">just sending mehate-mail.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54.967" end="00:14:57.333">He's an atheist, sohe was pretty much,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:57.400" end="00:14:59.567">putting downwhat I believe in</p>
      <p begin="00:14:59.633" end="00:15:02.000">and trying to getme to debate him.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.067" end="00:15:04.667">He, heh, becameobsessed with me</p>
      <p begin="00:15:04.733" end="00:15:08.000">and developed likethis, crush on me.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08.067" end="00:15:10.633">And then I told himwe would never date,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:10.700" end="00:15:12.700">I don't know you Idon't know where you live,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:12.767" end="00:15:14.833">you're too young,blah blah blah.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:14.900" end="00:15:17.667">And um, he flipped out.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:17.733" end="00:15:18.800">(nervous laughing)</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.867" end="00:15:20.500">The thing that pushed meto the edge</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.567" end="00:15:22.800">was he said he wasgonna, um, he wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:15:22.867" end="00:15:24.500">to bash my headinto the concrete</p>
      <p begin="00:15:24.567" end="00:15:26.467">until my brainsspilled out.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.533" end="00:15:28.867">And then kill my catand stuff like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:28.933" end="00:15:32.033">A few fans had emailedme the last year or so</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32.100" end="00:15:34.700">and said they werepraying for me</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.767" end="00:15:36.833">and that they were notlooking at porn anymore,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:36.900" end="00:15:39.567">and, you know, and then Ihad this other guy saying</p>
      <p begin="00:15:39.633" end="00:15:41.333">you need to put awarning on your website</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41.400" end="00:15:42.633">because kidscan see this</p>
      <p begin="00:15:42.700" end="00:15:44.300">my fourteen-year-old sonfound this, and then--</p>
      <p begin="00:15:44.367" end="00:15:45.633">Just all kinds ofpeople were like,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:45.700" end="00:15:48.800">sending me these emails,random emails and--</p>
      <p begin="00:15:48.867" end="00:15:51.500">You know it uh, andof course I would,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.567" end="00:15:53.000">I was alwayskind of sympathetic</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.067" end="00:15:56.933">to whatever they saidbut, um, there was some,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57.000" end="00:15:58.700">you know I was stillkind of hardened too,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:58.767" end="00:16:00.600">at the same time,because I was like well,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:00.667" end="00:16:03.067">I can't do anything else,this is what I'm good at.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:03.133" end="00:16:04.900">This is all that,I know.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:04.967" end="00:16:09.100">And, I kind ofbelieved it at the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:09.167" end="00:16:10.933">I didn't haveanybody you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:11.000" end="00:16:13.433">saying, you'rebetter than that.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:13.500" end="00:16:15.467">So, um...(nervous laughing)</p>
      <p begin="00:16:16.500" end="00:16:18.967">Some adult stars do"find god" and leave,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:19.033" end="00:16:21.733">but those arepeople who needed,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.800" end="00:16:24.567">who needed to be goneanyway, and did not have</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.633" end="00:16:25.967">the personal strength todo it and so they do</p>
      <p begin="00:16:26.033" end="00:16:28.567">look outside for somethingto help them leave.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.633" end="00:16:29.933">Um, there are plenty ofpeople in the business</p>
      <p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:31.867">who really shouldn't behere, because they have</p>
      <p begin="00:16:31.933" end="00:16:35.067">conflict about-- ifI was-, if I'd been raised</p>
      <p begin="00:16:35.133" end="00:16:38.133">to be ashamed of mybody, and to feel bad</p>
      <p begin="00:16:38.200" end="00:16:40.700">about men and their andthe horrible desires,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:40.767" end="00:16:44.933">but, did porn for other reasonseventually those two things</p>
      <p begin="00:16:45.000" end="00:16:46.800">are gonna co-, wheels aregonna come off the bus.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:46.867" end="00:16:49.033">I can only deny it solong, people try to deny,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:49.100" end="00:16:51.533">they stuff theirfeelings with, with drugs,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:53.600">and alcohol, or whatever it isthey stuff their feelings with</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.667" end="00:16:55.633">and after a six months,one year, five year,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:55.700" end="00:16:58.000">ten years, whatever itfinally goes you know what?</p>
      <p begin="00:16:58.067" end="00:16:59.133">I can't do this anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:59.200" end="00:17:02.000">Because for religion andespecially western religion,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:02.067" end="00:17:04.000">especially Christianitysays I love you,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:04.067" end="00:17:05.833">I forgive you, youcan come home now.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:05.900" end="00:17:08.633">And I will not push you out.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:08.700" end="00:17:12.100">And so that is incrediblypowerful and incredibly potent</p>
      <p begin="00:17:12.167" end="00:17:15.767">to have someone finallysay I don't shame you.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:15.833" end="00:17:16.800">I love you.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:16.867" end="00:17:18.900">You're welcome here.</p>

      <p begin="00:17:20.500" end="00:17:21.767">When you're involvedin this industry</p>
      <p begin="00:17:21.833" end="00:17:23.167">you lose your humanity.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:23.233" end="00:17:25.067">You're no longer treatedas a human being</p>
      <p begin="00:17:25.133" end="00:17:28.167">by eighty percent ofpeople out there.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:28.233" end="00:17:29.967">You're now, now scum.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:30.033" end="00:17:33.167">Like they maybe wanna, docertain things with you.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:33.233" end="00:17:35.067">But then, you're still scum.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35.133" end="00:17:37.633">And, like if, they maybe thrilled to have</p>
      <p begin="00:17:37.700" end="00:17:39.733">a roll in the sac withyou but when they leave,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:39.800" end="00:17:41.733">when you leave they'regonna wanna burn the sheets.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:41.800" end="00:17:44.967">Uh, ah, I got intoporn by accident.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.033" end="00:17:47.133">It wasn't somethingI planned on doing,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:50.633">uh, probably mighta beenthe, the least likely thing</p>
      <p begin="00:17:50.700" end="00:17:52.467">I thought I woulda done.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:52.533" end="00:17:53.867">I was singing inbands after I,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:53.933" end="00:17:55.800">a baseball thingdidn't work out,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:55.867" end="00:17:58.800">uh, I knew I could sing so Istarted singing in rock bands.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:58.867" end="00:18:01.767">And of course like allstruggling musicians</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01.833" end="00:18:04.400">you gotta make a littleextra dough on the side.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:04.467" end="00:18:07.733">It actually, my, my first nakedjob I was a nude artmodel</p>
      <p begin="00:18:07.800" end="00:18:10.567">for like you know college artclasses and stuff like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.633" end="00:18:12.733">And I was really kinda shybut not about my body</p>
      <p begin="00:18:12.800" end="00:18:15.500">just about talking I waskinda shy about talking.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15.567" end="00:18:16.733">but yeah I'd get nakedin front of people</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16.800" end="00:18:19.100">so I did that and a couplegirls in one of the classes</p>
      <p begin="00:18:19.167" end="00:18:22.000">asked to take some picturesof me and they did and--</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22.067" end="00:18:23.900">They came out pretty good andthey said can we send them</p>
      <p begin="00:18:23.967" end="00:18:26.133">to some magazines I said Idon't care do what you want.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26.200" end="00:18:27.433">And they sent'em out andand next thing I know</p>

      <p begin="00:19:04.100" end="00:19:06.600">And uh, that's kindahow it got started.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:06.667" end="00:19:08.933">I, I used to say it's likeborrowing somebody's body</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.000" end="00:19:10.067">to masturbate with.</p>

      <p begin="00:20:05.333" end="00:20:07.700">I think I said something like,</p>

      <p begin="00:21:12.933" end="00:21:15.100">and so I kinda miss thatpart of it and that's why</p>
      <p begin="00:21:15.167" end="00:21:16.600">I still like havinga relationship,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.667" end="00:21:19.000">when it happens, you know.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:19.067" end="00:21:22.000">And uh, you know for exampleeh, Tera Patrick man,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:22.067" end="00:21:23.567">not only wasshe incredible in bed</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23.633" end="00:21:26.233">but there was just,I just liked her.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:26.300" end="00:21:28.933">And, that that, sense ofhumor and the craziness,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:29.000" end="00:21:31.933">a little bitdifferent, you know.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:35.767">So, I hadn't dated anybodyin so long when I met her</p>
      <p begin="00:21:35.833" end="00:21:38.267">I forgot howto do it, and uh,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:38.333" end="00:21:40.333">I did ask her outto dinner twice,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:42.000">and we went out to dinnerand we had a good time</p>
      <p begin="00:21:42.067" end="00:21:45.133">but I dropped her off at herplace without asking her</p>
      <p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:46.900">if I could, come in.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:46.967" end="00:21:50.300">And I don't knoweh, I might have,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:50.367" end="00:21:51.800">she mightathought I was weird.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:51.867" end="00:21:55.133">I already had sex with her acouple of times, on camera,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:56.267">and she mighta thoughtit was weird that</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56.333" end="00:21:58.400">I didn't wanna come upand finish the date,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:58.467" end="00:22:00.700">but I was kinda showing herthat I wasn't just there</p>
      <p begin="00:22:00.767" end="00:22:05.100">for the sex, and, maybeit wasn't a good move</p>
      <p begin="00:22:05.167" end="00:22:06.833">cause you leave abeautiful woman like that</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06.900" end="00:22:08.467">alone for too long and somebodyelse is gonna come along</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08.533" end="00:22:10.067">and somebody elsedid come along and,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:10.133" end="00:22:11.300">that was that.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:11.367" end="00:22:13.933">She made it today,this is Tera Patrick.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:14.933">Hello.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:17.467">And uh, Tera is reasonablyknown in the business</p>
      <p begin="00:22:17.533" end="00:22:20.000">and hasn't evenworked that often.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:20.067" end="00:22:20.967">Apparently.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:22.800" end="00:22:23.800">Um.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24.467" end="00:22:26.233">I was just trying topace myself right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:26.300" end="00:22:28.233">One of my alltime favorites.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:34.267" end="00:22:36.967">Most of the people who seekit out don't have means</p>
      <p begin="00:22:37.033" end="00:22:41.400">of making that kind ofmoney by other means.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:41.467" end="00:22:44.133">I mean very fewwomen say hmm,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:44.200" end="00:22:46.133">I'm going to become asurgeon or I'm going</p>
      <p begin="00:22:46.200" end="00:22:49.167">to becomea pornography star.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:49.233" end="00:22:50.867">This country doesnot raise people</p>
      <p begin="00:22:50.933" end="00:22:51.933">with a very good work ethic.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:53.333">They don't know howto do anything else.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:53.400" end="00:22:54.967">They don't knowhow to do retail,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:55.033" end="00:22:58.867">they don't know how todo Excel spreadsheets.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:58.933" end="00:23:01.767">Many people who make theirway to adult entertainment,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:01.833" end="00:23:04.567">like rock-and-roll, are notsuited for nine-to-fivework.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:06.333" end="00:23:08.900">I, ran away fromhome at sixteen</p>
      <p begin="00:23:08.967" end="00:23:10.900">and was living on thestreets at seventeen.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:10.967" end="00:23:14.067">Uh, everything I ownedwas in two garbage bags.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.133" end="00:23:18.867">Um, my parents were saying Ihope you just kill yourself</p>
      <p begin="00:23:18.933" end="00:23:20.933">and make life a loteasier for the rest of us.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:21.000" end="00:23:23.833">Uh, it was just on and onand on so there I was</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.900" end="00:23:26.167">out on the streets andthen, when I got taken in</p>
      <p begin="00:23:26.233" end="00:23:29.433">with a foster family,um, I made sure that</p>
      <p begin="00:23:29.500" end="00:23:31.300">I kept finishing schoolwith good grades</p>
      <p begin="00:23:31.367" end="00:23:32.800">because that was gonnabe my future that</p>
      <p begin="00:23:32.867" end="00:23:34.167">was gonna be my ticketoutta there and then</p>
      <p begin="00:23:34.233" end="00:23:36.800">when I went to college onfull academic scholarship</p>
      <p begin="00:23:36.867" end="00:23:38.167">I never actuallywent to classes.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:38.233" end="00:23:40.367">I said okay I've gotfree room and board,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:40.433" end="00:23:41.400">I need to make money.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:41.467" end="00:23:43.500">I need to get some sort ofsecurity and stability</p>
      <p begin="00:23:43.567" end="00:23:47.267">in my life so I don't haveto turn tricks</p>
      <p begin="00:23:47.333" end="00:23:48.933">to get food to eat.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:49.000" end="00:23:52.367">So I took up stripping, I wentto all the local stripbars,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:52.433" end="00:23:56.067">and from there I started doingmagazines in New YorkCity.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:56.133" end="00:23:57.167">I would take a trainto New York CIty</p>
      <p begin="00:23:57.233" end="00:23:59.000">on weekendsand do magazines.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:59.067" end="00:24:02.800">And then, uh, a photographersaid he knew a director</p>
      <p begin="00:24:02.867" end="00:24:04.833">in California named BudLee who could direct me</p>
      <p begin="00:24:04.900" end="00:24:06.267">in some movies if Iwanted to do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:06.333" end="00:24:09.767">So um, I packed up mysuitcase and a teddy bear</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09.833" end="00:24:11.533">and went out to LA.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:15.967">Made a movie for Bud Lee,married him, didn't come back.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:16.033" end="00:24:18.467">The reason that Iwanted to do porn,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:18.533" end="00:24:22.167">even though I was so smart,Miss MENSA and all that is</p>
      <p begin="00:24:22.233" end="00:24:25.433">uh, it's precisely because Iwanted to stop being known</p>
      <p begin="00:24:25.500" end="00:24:29.467">as the nerd the geek the,the one that you come over</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29.533" end="00:24:31.033">and you be nice to mejust so you can copy off</p>
      <p begin="00:24:31.100" end="00:24:32.933">of my tests, you know.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:33.000" end="00:24:33.967">(laughing)</p>
      <p begin="00:24:34.033" end="00:24:36.033">I would hang out with someof my misfit friends</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.100" end="00:24:37.867">and they had, theyhad adult magazines</p>
      <p begin="00:24:37.933" end="00:24:39.533">hidden under their bed andthey would look at them</p>
      <p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:41.400">and I would be peekingover their shoulder going</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.467" end="00:24:42.933">I wish someone wouldlook at me like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:43.000" end="00:24:45.933">And that was just likemy wildest fantasy that</p>
      <p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:47.267">someone would thinkthat I was pretty</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47.333" end="00:24:50.167">and sexy and, woo!</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.233" end="00:24:52.833">All my life I'd justbeen the nerd and the geek.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:52.900" end="00:24:54.500">So it was like a fantasycome true for me that</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.567" end="00:24:57.033">someone wanted to see meon the cover of a magazine.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:57.100" end="00:24:59.433">When I got to porn it waslike wait, I get to pick</p>
      <p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:01.400">which one of these good-lookingguys I wanna sleep with?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:01.467" end="00:25:03.000">And uh, you're gonnapay me for it</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.067" end="00:25:04.100">and then you're gonnaput me on a box cover</p>
      <p begin="00:25:04.167" end="00:25:05.100">and give me tons of money?</p>
      <p begin="00:25:05.167" end="00:25:06.100">(laughing)</p>
      <p begin="00:25:06.167" end="00:25:08.233">It was just uh, areally big step up</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08.300" end="00:25:10.267">from whereI was coming from.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:10.333" end="00:25:13.300">Porn wasn't all that muchof a mental challenge</p>
      <p begin="00:25:13.367" end="00:25:15.933">for me shall we say,um, standing there</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:19.167">and saying my silly linesjust, it didn't take up</p>
      <p begin="00:25:19.233" end="00:25:20.367">a whole lot of myday so meanwhile</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20.433" end="00:25:21.433">you got a lot oftime to sit around</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.500" end="00:25:24.133">and wait so uh, I justkept myself busy</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.200" end="00:25:26.300">by learning everysingle job on the set.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:26.367" end="00:25:29.300">Um, I (laughing)I would get</p>

      <p begin="00:25:56.100" end="00:25:58.967">Um, what made me different wasI was the first half-asian</p>

      <p begin="00:26:10.333" end="00:26:11.533">an asian girl in awhite girl movie.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:12.533">(laughing)</p>
      <p begin="00:26:12.600" end="00:26:13.700">It's justthe way it was.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:13.767" end="00:26:15.967">And then when I came inand I was only half-asian</p>
      <p begin="00:26:16.033" end="00:26:18.067">the features were soft enoughthat they could still</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18.133" end="00:26:19.367">put me on a cover and I couldstill be a white girl,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:19.433" end="00:26:21.500">or and asian girl, theycould play me either way.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:21.567" end="00:26:23.867">Or they could play meas an Indian or a Gypsy,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:23.933" end="00:26:24.733">or, Greek girl!</p>
      <p begin="00:26:24.800" end="00:26:26.533">They gave me allthe different roles.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:26.600" end="00:26:28.067">So they just, theywound up using</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.133" end="00:26:29.567">my lookas very versatile.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:29.633" end="00:26:31.967">And so I became thefirst "cross-over" star</p>
      <p begin="00:26:32.033" end="00:26:35.467">from a minority, and then uh,I guess they did pretty well</p>
      <p begin="00:26:35.533" end="00:26:37.900">with me cause after I leftVivid they got Koby Tie,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.967" end="00:26:41.133">who was full asian, so,I kinda opened the door</p>
      <p begin="00:26:41.200" end="00:26:43.333">for the minorities tobecome A-listers.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43.400" end="00:26:45.233">I, I hated doinglive appearance.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:45.300" end="00:26:47.300">Oh I'm getting sweaty justlooking at this picture.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:47.367" end="00:26:48.500">(laughing) Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:48.567" end="00:26:50.967">I spent like all yearlong dreading the CES Show.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:51.033" end="00:26:53.400">I would just have tokeep telling myself</p>
      <p begin="00:26:53.467" end="00:26:54.400">they're more scaredthan you are,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:54.467" end="00:26:55.467">they're more scaredthan you are.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:55.533" end="00:26:57.567">Cause I'd smile and I'd say"So what's your name?"</p>
      <p begin="00:26:57.633" end="00:27:00.867">and they'd go--(laughing)</p>
      <p begin="00:27:00.933" end="00:27:03.933">they'd just look at me.Okay what's your name?!</p>
      <p begin="00:27:04.000" end="00:27:05.900">If you see my very firstinterviews from when</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.967" end="00:27:07.067">I was nineteen,twenty years old,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:07.133" end="00:27:09.233">I said I'm gonna retirewhen I'm thirty.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:09.300" end="00:27:10.233">And people wouldlaugh and say</p>
      <p begin="00:27:10.300" end="00:27:11.267">oh you've got itall planned out.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:11.333" end="00:27:13.233">There really wasn'tany question about it.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:14.033" end="00:27:18.267">I had, gotten married,and, then divorced.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:18.333" end="00:27:22.067">And I met someone whohad adult bookstores.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:22.133" end="00:27:24.433">So I basically gotmy introduction</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24.500" end="00:27:27.300">to the adult entertainmentworld through working</p>
      <p begin="00:27:27.367" end="00:27:30.467">in adult bookstores,and then consequently</p>
      <p begin="00:27:30.533" end="00:27:34.200">owning adult bookstoresand I saw the women</p>
      <p begin="00:27:34.267" end="00:27:38.033">that were doing movies atthe time and, I was just,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:38.100" end="00:27:42.633">amazed, because, they hadpimples on their rear-ends,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42.700" end="00:27:45.200">they had on no makeup,their feet were dirty,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:45.267" end="00:27:48.133">their hair was dirty,and I thought my god,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:48.200" end="00:27:51.567">this is not a really goodrepresentation of women.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:51.633" end="00:27:52.700">I wanna do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:52.767" end="00:27:59.133">I mean I had done, um, afew magazines and a few uh,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:02.067">like, 8 mm loops, andthen I came to California,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:02.133" end="00:28:05.300">and I picked up one ofthe free papers and,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:05.367" end="00:28:07.000">there was an ad.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:07.067" end="00:28:10.300">My family was very, veryokay with what I did</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.367" end="00:28:13.200">because I did tell themwhat I was about to do</p>
      <p begin="00:28:13.267" end="00:28:15.667">before I actuallydid anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.733" end="00:28:18.667">I mean I'd done acouple of photo shoots,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:18.733" end="00:28:21.333">and decided that I neededto tell my family</p>
      <p begin="00:28:21.400" end="00:28:24.667">before it got out therebecause I didn't want</p>
      <p begin="00:28:24.733" end="00:28:27.200">them finding outfrom someone else.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:27.267" end="00:28:29.600">And they're likewell do, you think</p>
      <p begin="00:28:29.667" end="00:28:30.867">you can make money at it?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:30.933" end="00:28:33.200">You think you can have a goodcareer and be happy doing this?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:33.267" end="00:28:37.433">And I said yes I do, andthey said good, go do it.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.500" end="00:28:41.733">We had a very smallcommunity of people,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:41.800" end="00:28:45.233">of players, thatwe all worked with.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.300" end="00:28:48.167">And we all worked witheach other quite a bit.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:48.233" end="00:28:50.400">So the community wassmall, we were familiar</p>
      <p begin="00:28:50.467" end="00:28:53.200">with one another,and, we actu--</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.267" end="00:28:56.100">it's like when you, havea, a new boyfriend</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56.167" end="00:28:58.500">or new girlfriend or anew husband or wife,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.567" end="00:29:01.167">it takes a little whilebefore you know what</p>
      <p begin="00:29:01.233" end="00:29:03.267">pushes their buttons,what turns them on</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.333" end="00:29:07.233">what makes them feelgood, and then it starts</p>
      <p begin="00:29:07.300" end="00:29:12.733">to become very intimate,and, you can actually,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:12.800" end="00:29:15.167">have an intimaterelationship with the person</p>
      <p begin="00:29:15.233" end="00:29:16.700">you're workingwith on screen,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.767" end="00:29:19.067">and be fond of themafter the movie is over.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:19.133" end="00:29:25.067">Um, but they're justgenerally sweet nice people.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.167" end="00:29:29.067">I was beingoffered parts in movies,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.133" end="00:29:32.167">in, or photo shootsor what have you,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:32.233" end="00:29:35.100">and they didn't want to payme the amount of money</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.167" end="00:29:39.567">I wanted, and I said no.I just, I held out.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.633" end="00:29:44.533">So, um, and subsequentlyI started stripping,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:44.600" end="00:29:48.200">going across the, basicallyacross the world stripping.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.267" end="00:29:53.467">And uh, doing photo shoots withClub Magazine predominantly.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.533" end="00:29:55.667">And um, so theydidn't see me in front,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:55.733" end="00:29:57.233">people didn't see me infront of the camera</p>
      <p begin="00:29:57.300" end="00:30:00.333">so they thought okay,she's retired.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.400" end="00:30:02.167">I've been retired andcome back so many times</p>
      <p begin="00:30:02.233" end="00:30:04.267">I can't keep track anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:04.333" end="00:30:06.133">I've also beendead a few times.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:08.133" end="00:30:12.067">I saw an add in the paper itsaid "Nude fun, big bucks."</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.133" end="00:30:14.400">and uh, it was an auditionfor an X-rated movie.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.467" end="00:30:16.533">Two days later I get acall from the producer,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.600" end="00:30:18.733">they wanna give me apart in the movie.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:18.800" end="00:30:20.767">I hadn't planned on that.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:20.833" end="00:30:25.600">At the time, I had appliedto the Hebrew Union Seminary</p>
      <p begin="00:30:25.667" end="00:30:28.633">in Cincinnati, wherethey uh, train people</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28.700" end="00:30:30.200">to become Rabbis.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:30.267" end="00:30:33.667">So I'm trying tomeasure, do I wanna do this,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:33.733" end="00:30:35.633">or do I wanna be in a pornmovie because it seems</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.700" end="00:30:37.600">if I take the part inthe porn movie I maybe,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.667" end="00:30:42.633">um, cutting some of my optionsoff, for future life.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:42.700" end="00:30:46.833">And the uh, seminary inCincinnati said we'll take you</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.900" end="00:30:50.133">but the first two years youhave to go to Jerusalem</p>
      <p begin="00:30:50.200" end="00:30:52.200">and study Aramaic, which,I would rather go</p>
      <p begin="00:30:52.267" end="00:30:55.533">to Cleveland and studytheir sewer system.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:57.600">Um,no interest there.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:57.667" end="00:31:00.533">So I decided I wouldmake the porn movie.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:00.600" end="00:31:04.167">And, in any case the kindof Rabbi I would become,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:04.233" end="00:31:06.833">would be the kind thatcould've made a porn movie.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:06.900" end="00:31:09.333">And uh, I wentahead and did the job.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.400" end="00:31:12.267">I think I had to becomea sex star just</p>
      <p begin="00:31:12.333" end="00:31:14.267">to come back to normal!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14.333" end="00:31:17.367">Cause I'd been so humiliatedby being the fat kid!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.433" end="00:31:20.133">I had the largest breastsin the seventh grade!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20.200" end="00:31:21.500">The guys wouldmake fun of me</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.567" end="00:31:23.633">and point at meand tease me!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:23.700" end="00:31:25.733">Do you know howdeep those scars go?!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:25.800" end="00:31:27.233">That's ugly shit!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27.300" end="00:31:30.500">Those are the peoplethat become centerfolds!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:30.567" end="00:31:32.200">Cause they gotsomething to prove.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:32.267" end="00:31:36.133">I was lucky enough to uh, bein the era when they were</p>
      <p begin="00:31:36.200" end="00:31:37.633">actually trying to makemovies where you needed</p>
      <p begin="00:31:37.700" end="00:31:39.300">to remember lines.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:39.367" end="00:31:41.433">And I had the,I was good at that.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:41.500" end="00:31:44.767">So, I got hired formy acting ability,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:44.833" end="00:31:47.400">which being agood actor in porn,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.467" end="00:31:50.300">is like being the wisest manin the kingdom of the fools.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50.367" end="00:31:51.633">He promised that Icould fuck you next.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:51.700" end="00:31:52.867">He what?!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:53.933" end="00:31:54.700">Gah!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:55.400" end="00:31:56.200">Ow!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:56.767" end="00:31:57.200">(screaming)</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57.267" end="00:31:58.700">Let him alone!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:58.767" end="00:31:59.833">I said let him alone!</p>
      <p begin="00:31:59.900" end="00:32:00.633">(shrieking)</p>
      <p begin="00:32:00.700" end="00:32:02.867">Ow!Ah, oh uh!</p>
      <p begin="00:32:02.933" end="00:32:04.867">Get the fuckoutta here!</p>
      <p begin="00:32:04.933" end="00:32:07.400">My ankle!Ow, my ankle!</p>
      <p begin="00:32:07.933" end="00:32:09.633">I was terribleat the sex.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:09.700" end="00:32:10.633">Just rotten!</p>
      <p begin="00:32:10.700" end="00:32:12.233">I was just sotraumatized by it.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:12.300" end="00:32:16.367">But I eventually did learnhow to have sex on camera.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:16.433" end="00:32:20.633">I was on the beach in San Diegoand uh, I was by myself.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:20.700" end="00:32:23.567">and I'm sitting there,and I notice there's a,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:23.633" end="00:32:26.733">really beautiful woman,laying on a towel and so</p>
      <p begin="00:32:26.800" end="00:32:29.800">my gaze drifts over to her andher boyfriend looks at me</p>
      <p begin="00:32:29.867" end="00:32:32.300">and sees her--and I look away.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32.367" end="00:32:33.800">And then eventually I'ddrift back and I'm looking</p>
      <p begin="00:32:33.867" end="00:32:36.200">at her again and theboyfriend sees me looking</p>

      <p begin="00:32:59.933" end="00:33:01.733">I was so happy that's whatit was, he recognized me</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01.800" end="00:33:03.833">from the movie businessand he wasn't gonna</p>
      <p begin="00:33:03.900" end="00:33:06.167">kick my ass it wasa true delight.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:06.233" end="00:33:07.167">A true delight.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07.233" end="00:33:08.567">We becamefriends at that point.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:08.633" end="00:33:10.300">I hadn't told my parentsthat I was doing this.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:10.367" end="00:33:13.800">I told them I had, wasdoing commercials</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.867" end="00:33:18.233">and low-budget nothing,and, well, that I,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:18.300" end="00:33:20.733">I knew that theyweren't gonna be.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:20.800" end="00:33:22.667">I didn't suspect theywould be very approving</p>
      <p begin="00:33:22.733" end="00:33:24.433">of this kinda stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:24.500" end="00:33:27.367">I made the originalcall prepared</p>
      <p begin="00:33:27.433" end="00:33:29.533">to become the blacksheep of the family.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:31.567">It didn't happen.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:31.633" end="00:33:34.467">I'm sure they wereless than thrilled.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34.533" end="00:33:36.333">When my mother would beat the grocery store</p>
      <p begin="00:33:36.400" end="00:33:38.467">the next day and they say</p>
      <p begin="00:33:38.533" end="00:33:39.567">"Good to see you,how you doing?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.633" end="00:33:41.233">What's going on?"</p>
      <p begin="00:33:41.300" end="00:33:42.600">"Well! My son the doctor's</p>
      <p begin="00:33:42.667" end="00:33:45.267">coming back from Israel,and my other son,</p>

      <p begin="00:33:50.300" end="00:33:52.700">Well I think people mayhave a negative reaction</p>
      <p begin="00:33:52.767" end="00:33:57.667">to someone who's a porn starfor a combination of reasons.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:57.733" end="00:34:00.967">One is, somebody who seemsto indiscriminately</p>
      <p begin="00:34:01.033" end="00:34:03.400">be willing to sleepwith anyone,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:03.467" end="00:34:06.400">whether it's onfilm or not, is,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:06.467" end="00:34:09.267">no matter what peoplesay, still not somebody</p>
      <p begin="00:34:09.333" end="00:34:11.600">who's particularlyadmired and,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:11.667" end="00:34:15.967">again may pose a threatto many relationships.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16.033" end="00:34:18.967">It is legal work,but it's fucking.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:20.700" end="00:34:21.767">With pictures.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21.833" end="00:34:24.267">People say "you should,should go into politics"</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24.333" end="00:34:26.233">There's too many pictureswith dicks in my ass,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:26.300" end="00:34:28.333">it's like, it's notgoing to happen.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:29.333" end="00:34:30.800">It happenedby happenstance.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:30.867" end="00:34:34.433">I came up with some friendsand I went to a club</p>
      <p begin="00:34:34.500" end="00:34:39.267">called The Rainbow, and, Imet there Althea Flint,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:39.333" end="00:34:43.267">the wife of Larry Flint,and a photographer that</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43.333" end="00:34:46.833">she had in tow, and theyapproached me and invited me</p>
      <p begin="00:34:46.900" end="00:34:50.667">to their table, and asked meif I wanted to go to a club</p>
      <p begin="00:34:50.733" end="00:34:52.933">and have some drinksand I did.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:53.000" end="00:34:55.767">And she was, doing aninterview for Sting,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:55.833" end="00:34:58.767">and we were up there lookingto meet some rockstars,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:58.833" end="00:34:59.967">you know, wewere just girls.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00.033" end="00:35:01.833">Doing our thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:01.900" end="00:35:05.333">And she took us in her limo,she had this black limo that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.400" end="00:35:07.667">had this Think Pink onthe license plate and this,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:07.733" end="00:35:09.733">I think it was a nakedlady on the side of it.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09.800" end="00:35:12.000">And I was soimpressed by that.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.067" end="00:35:14.633">She said what do you doand I said I'm a model</p>
      <p begin="00:35:14.700" end="00:35:15.633">and she said Wow!</p>
      <p begin="00:35:15.700" end="00:35:18.400">I sh-- you know, I, Iown Hustler Magazine</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18.467" end="00:35:19.800">and we're gonna putyou in Hustler.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:19.867" end="00:35:21.700">So, that was that!</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21.767" end="00:35:26.633">Um, I went into Hustler andum, started doing magazines.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:26.700" end="00:35:30.300">My brother found out and, hehad tried to talk me into it</p>
      <p begin="00:35:30.367" end="00:35:32.600">many times, because everybodyalways said Hey Buck!</p>
      <p begin="00:35:32.667" end="00:35:34.733">Can you get your sisterto do a movie oh my god!</p>
      <p begin="00:35:34.800" end="00:35:38.700">And, um, you know, wenever worked together,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:38.767" end="00:35:43.000">on set, but, we alwayschampioned each other's careers.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:43.067" end="00:35:47.400">And so my brother said to me,um, I want you to do a movie.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:47.467" end="00:35:48.800">And he set it upwith Sin City,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:48.867" end="00:35:51.800">it was actually done forSin City and it was called</p>
      <p begin="00:35:51.867" end="00:35:53.867">Babewatch, and it was for mybrother's Babewatch series,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:53.933" end="00:35:56.567">cause he said if you'regonna do movies for anybody,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:56.633" end="00:35:59.633">you have to do, you haveto do one for me, sis,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59.700" end="00:36:01.333">so I said okay I will.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:01.400" end="00:36:03.500">And the sex wasreal, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:03.567" end="00:36:06.700">you'd say, how doyou want the blow-job?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:06.767" end="00:36:08.533">And he'd say, how doyou like the blowjob?</p>
      <p begin="00:36:08.600" end="00:36:10.867">And that would beit, you know and that,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:10.933" end="00:36:12.400">we would build offof that.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:12.467" end="00:36:14.033">You know, I wasthe kinda person,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:14.100" end="00:36:15.533">it, I lived alife of excess,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:15.600" end="00:36:18.733">and people wouldinvite me to parties,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:20.367">and they would think Wow!</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20.433" end="00:36:24.333">if I offer her someparty tools, then,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:25.600">I'm gonna havemy night set up,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:25.667" end="00:36:27.067">I'm gonna wind upgetting laid all night</p>
      <p begin="00:36:27.133" end="00:36:28.667">by this beautifulporn star.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:28.733" end="00:36:32.033">And then as my addictionwent through another door,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:32.100" end="00:36:34.700">they'd hand me the bagof coke and I'd wind up</p>
      <p begin="00:36:34.767" end="00:36:36.100">in the bathroom allnight, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:36.167" end="00:36:37.967">and you wouldn't be able todrag me out of the bathroom</p>
      <p begin="00:36:38.033" end="00:36:39.900">and I'd be likedon't touch me!</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.967" end="00:36:40.933">and oh!</p>
      <p begin="00:36:41.000" end="00:36:46.067">And all of my lifestarted to kind of spiral.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:46.133" end="00:36:49.800">I wound up getting arrested,um, on the highway,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49.867" end="00:36:53.433">and the police knewexactly who I was,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:53.500" end="00:36:55.900">when I got arrested,and, they wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:36:55.967" end="00:36:58.367">to make an example of mewith the court system.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58.433" end="00:36:59.733">They knew that Iwas, you know,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:59.800" end="00:37:03.100">a big porn star, andum, the gig was up.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03.167" end="00:37:04.967">And I had to face it.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:05.033" end="00:37:07.367">And it was the greatestthing that ever happened</p>
      <p begin="00:37:07.433" end="00:37:09.733">to me when I look backon it now because,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:09.800" end="00:37:12.167">it really broughtme into reality.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:12.967" end="00:37:16.600">For the women, they'remuch more damned by society</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.667" end="00:37:19.500">because no matter howsanctified they are,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:19.567" end="00:37:21.067">they're stillconsidered to be whores,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:21.133" end="00:37:22.800">and it's getting worseand worse and worse</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.867" end="00:37:25.633">because a lot of themhave turned to,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.700" end="00:37:26.933">what I am vehementlyopposed to,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:27.000" end="00:37:29.733">the escort services, tofurther their career.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.800" end="00:37:35.400">In many ways, it has adehumanizing quality,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.467" end="00:37:39.433">because what you'reresponding to are a set of,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:39.500" end="00:37:41.433">physical cues.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:41.500" end="00:37:43.533">You areresponding to the body,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.600" end="00:37:47.100">and you're responding tothe sexual acts per say</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.167" end="00:37:50.500">in a way that isquite animalistic.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.567" end="00:37:56.700">And, having a more fulldepiction of the person</p>
      <p begin="00:37:56.767" end="00:38:01.667">may even detract from theability to use it purely</p>
      <p begin="00:38:01.733" end="00:38:06.100">as masturbatory or otherkind of sexual stimulation.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:06.167" end="00:38:08.167">You can takeevery other category,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:08.233" end="00:38:10.133">every other idea,every other thought.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:10.200" end="00:38:13.600">Basically happiness and successin life all boils down</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13.667" end="00:38:16.000">to what are the quality ofyour bonds with other people.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:16.067" end="00:38:18.500">Having anything to do withthe adult industry hacks</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.567" end="00:38:21.500">away those bonds, so you'reisolated, alienated,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:21.567" end="00:38:23.800">um, pushed awayto the margins,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.867" end="00:38:25.767">and not treatedas a human being.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.833" end="00:38:29.167">That's a recipe for disaster,for me and for anyone else.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.067" end="00:38:33.433">Um, when I was in college acouple of us on the dance team</p>
      <p begin="00:38:33.500" end="00:38:34.700">worked at Hooters so Iwas working at Hooters,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34.767" end="00:38:36.933">I love doing that, a lotof the girls at Hooters</p>
      <p begin="00:38:37.000" end="00:38:38.900">were telling me how I wouldmake a lot of moneystripping</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.967" end="00:38:42.100">and then I had a boyfriendin college who brought me,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:42.167" end="00:38:43.933">I went with him and his friendsto a strip club one night</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:46.100">because they always used togo watch amateur night.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.167" end="00:38:47.433">He's like Ithink you could win,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.500" end="00:38:48.833">I think you could beat thesegirls at amateur night</p>
      <p begin="00:38:48.900" end="00:38:51.800">so I entered and I won, I gotfirst place out of twelvegirls</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.867" end="00:38:55.467">in the amateur contest,and I got $500.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.533" end="00:38:57.767">So I was like this is a reallycool job I get to drink,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:57.833" end="00:38:59.733">and danceand make money.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:59.800" end="00:39:01.600">This is way better thananything else I can imagine.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.667" end="00:39:03.833">When I was twenty-oneI used to watch a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:39:03.900" end="00:39:06.833">of those cinemaX moviesand so I went to uh,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.900" end="00:39:09.000">Blockbuster and I gotthe address off the box</p>
      <p begin="00:39:09.067" end="00:39:11.833">of a cinemaX movie and Imailed some Polaroids</p>
      <p begin="00:39:11.900" end="00:39:14.033">of myself and a a fewheadshots I had taken,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.100" end="00:39:16.033">um, like, and justpictures and I mailed it</p>
      <p begin="00:39:16.100" end="00:39:17.967">and I wrote this letter abouthow I think I'd reallylike</p>
      <p begin="00:39:18.033" end="00:39:18.967">to be in the movies.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:19.033" end="00:39:20.800">And I heard nothing andthen three months later</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.867" end="00:39:22.500">I actually got acall from Playboy.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22.567" end="00:39:24.067">Coming to this industry Ipretty much came into it</p>
      <p begin="00:39:24.133" end="00:39:27.267">thinking okay I'm goingto somehow be one</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27.333" end="00:39:29.700">of the most well-knownpornstars of all time.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:29.767" end="00:39:31.267">I wouldn't wanna come intoit and just be another girl</p>
      <p begin="00:39:31.333" end="00:39:33.033">that was aroundfor two years</p>
      <p begin="00:39:33.100" end="00:39:35.533">and then have to go bea hooker. You know.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:35.600" end="00:39:37.167">After I did the Hus-the Playboy thing,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.233" end="00:39:40.233">um, I shot for Hustler, thenext month I came out to LA,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:40.300" end="00:39:42.733">um, within three weeksafter shooting for Hustler,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:42.800" end="00:39:45.900">um, his wife and hisdau- uh his sister,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:45.967" end="00:39:47.133">or, his daughter, told mehow much they loved me</p>
      <p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:49.900">and they ended up taking me onthe Larry Flint Freedom Tour.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.967" end="00:39:52.467">They chose four girlsto go with Larry Flint</p>
      <p begin="00:39:52.533" end="00:39:54.133">to like different Hustlerstores on the freedom tour</p>
      <p begin="00:39:54.200" end="00:39:56.200">and they chose me andthen Hustler had me,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:56.267" end="00:39:58.133">my very first daybeing on the show um,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:58.200" end="00:39:59.733">a Hustler chose me tosign at their booth,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.800" end="00:40:02.200">cause they don't havecontract girls they pick girls.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.267" end="00:40:04.100">And then a month later therewas a Magic Convention</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.167" end="00:40:06.200">which is a clothing conventionand Hustler was launching</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.267" end="00:40:08.867">their clothing andHustler had chosen me</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.933" end="00:40:10.933">to be the model of theirclothing and they made,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11.000" end="00:40:12.200">you know, picturesof me modeling it.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:12.267" end="00:40:14.100">So I really didn'tthink about life after porn</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.167" end="00:40:16.167">because I justcouldn't believe how like,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:16.233" end="00:40:17.900">all these thingskept happening.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.967" end="00:40:19.567">I mean just the things thathappened to me as a new girl</p>
      <p begin="00:40:19.633" end="00:40:21.567">in porn don't happen tomost new girls I mean,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:21.633" end="00:40:23.500">I met Larry Flint um,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23.567" end="00:40:25.867">pretty much my secondmonth in the business.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:25.933" end="00:40:27.100">So I didn't thinkabout life after.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27.167" end="00:40:28.667">I just said--I just always said</p>
      <p begin="00:40:28.733" end="00:40:30.200">I'm gonna get marriedand have kids.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:30.267" end="00:40:31.900">I used to sayby twenty-seven.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.967" end="00:40:33.567">Now I say I wanna getmarried by thirty</p>
      <p begin="00:40:33.633" end="00:40:35.067">and have kidsby thirty-two.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35.133" end="00:40:36.867">When I was marriedI only did girl-girl.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:36.933" end="00:40:38.233">I left my husbandand did boy-girl.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:38.300" end="00:40:41.600">Um, when I got back withmy husband at kickass</p>
      <p begin="00:40:41.667" end="00:40:44.000">I only did girl-girlagain, we split up,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:44.067" end="00:40:45.133">I did boy-girl, heh!</p>
      <p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:47.767">Then I took like a hiatusfor about six-seven months</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.833" end="00:40:49.000">and didn't shoot anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:49.067" end="00:40:50.267">And that's whenI met this guy,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.333" end="00:40:52.033">um, who's my, ended upbecoming my fiance,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:52.100" end="00:40:54.233">but we were dating, andI didn't do boy-girl</p>
      <p begin="00:40:54.300" end="00:40:56.133">when I was with him forthe first six months,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:56.200" end="00:40:58.200">and then he was like, don'tyou think you should go</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.267" end="00:41:00.900">get a new porn contractbecause that's extra income</p>
      <p begin="00:41:00.967" end="00:41:01.900">we can have every month.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.967" end="00:41:03.867">And I was like well,you want me to have sex</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.933" end="00:41:04.933">with other guys?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05.000" end="00:41:06.533">And he was like well, it'sonly six times a year</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06.600" end="00:41:08.100">you're gonna do it, andit's with a condom.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08.167" end="00:41:09.167">I was like okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:09.233" end="00:41:10.900">Then of course, like, twodays before the movie</p>
      <p begin="00:41:10.967" end="00:41:13.200">my ex was like, I don't want youhaving sex with other guys.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13.267" end="00:41:14.200">Arrrrg! Arr!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.267" end="00:41:15.533">Let go of me!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:15.600" end="00:41:17.867">Your derri&#232;re may be pretty,but that don't mean</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.933" end="00:41:21.033">it's bull-worked from apromiscuous lashing.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21.100" end="00:41:21.533">SLAP!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21.600" end="00:41:22.200">Ow!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:22.267" end="00:41:25.200">&#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:41:25.267" end="00:41:26.533">Every two-and-a-halfmonths I'd have to shoot</p>
      <p begin="00:41:26.600" end="00:41:29.200">a boy-girl scene and er-usually about two days before</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29.267" end="00:41:30.700">he would start beingreally mean to me,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:30.767" end="00:41:32.700">and calling me names, eventhough he was the one</p>
      <p begin="00:41:32.767" end="00:41:33.933">who wanted meto do the movies.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:36.033">Then, on the day when I'dgo to shoot the movie</p>
      <p begin="00:41:36.100" end="00:41:38.033">he'd go out with his friendsand get really drunk,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:38.100" end="00:41:40.100">then he usually would notkiss me or anything</p>
      <p begin="00:41:40.167" end="00:41:41.833">for two days later, thenwhen my check would come in</p>
      <p begin="00:41:41.900" end="00:41:44.600">he's like that's my check, I letyou have sex with other people.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44.667" end="00:41:46.233">And then when I wouldbe asleep sometimes,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:46.300" end="00:41:48.733">I'd be asleep and I'dhear him watching my movies.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:50.000">He'd go and putit in like slow motion</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50.067" end="00:41:51.100">and make sure theguy wore a condom</p>
      <p begin="00:41:51.167" end="00:41:52.800">and I wasn'tlying about it.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:53.833" end="00:41:54.833">Um, let's see.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:54.900" end="00:41:56.600">The most I ever made in amonth was probably when</p>
      <p begin="00:41:56.667" end="00:41:58.267">I was running for governorbecause my website</p>
      <p begin="00:41:58.333" end="00:41:59.833">was making aroundtwenty-thousand a month</p>
      <p begin="00:41:59.900" end="00:42:03.033">and then my online storeselling t-shirts and buttons</p>
      <p begin="00:42:03.100" end="00:42:04.833">made about ten-fifteenthousand a month,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:04.900" end="00:42:06.600">and, I felt really badcause I didn't have time</p>
      <p begin="00:42:06.667" end="00:42:07.933">to mail'em all outso I just ended up</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:09.767">not mailing peopletheir orders.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:09.833" end="00:42:10.800">I feel reallybad about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.867" end="00:42:13.267">Um, and then my contractwas six thousand a month</p>
      <p begin="00:42:13.333" end="00:42:15.167">and I was featuredancing, at that time</p>
      <p begin="00:42:15.233" end="00:42:17.133">feature dancing usedto pay a lot more.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:17.200" end="00:42:19.200">That was like, six thousandfor like, three weeks.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:19.267" end="00:42:20.200">I dunno how much that is,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:20.267" end="00:42:22.300">maybe like 50, 60thousand in a month.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:22.367" end="00:42:23.400">That's probably the most.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:23.467" end="00:42:25.300">And then I won a gameshow around that same time.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:25.367" end="00:42:27.233">I won a game show Who Wants tobe Governor of California?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:27.300" end="00:42:28.633">I won anothertwenty-one thousand.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:28.700" end="00:42:30.667">Um, that was great.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:30.733" end="00:42:32.267">Um, I guess the most inthe year would probably</p>
      <p begin="00:42:32.333" end="00:42:34.100">be around 300 thousand.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:34.167" end="00:42:35.267">I mean I don't think Ithought I was set for life</p>
      <p begin="00:42:35.333" end="00:42:37.100">I always used to jokewith everyone that um,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:37.167" end="00:42:39.933">I'm either going to, justmake a lot of money</p>
      <p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:42.933">or I might worst case scenarioI'll marry a rich person.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:43.000" end="00:42:44.200">That's what I always said.</p>

      <p begin="00:42:59.033" end="00:43:01.100">I don't think they did thisas a short term investment</p>
      <p begin="00:43:01.167" end="00:43:03.933">in their own future,but they burned out.</p>

      <p begin="00:47:28.200" end="00:47:33.200">But, as a danger to that,because, it wears on your mind.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:34.367" end="00:47:36.533">My parents didn't take, reallyan interest in my life</p>
      <p begin="00:47:36.600" end="00:47:39.533">and I was also sexuallyabused at nine-years-old.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:39.600" end="00:47:43.933">I had a teenaged boy and hissister who was my classmate</p>

      <p begin="00:47:47.300" end="00:47:50.433">for the first time in mylife and it horrified me.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50.500" end="00:47:52.433">Yeah, as soon as Ibarely graduated high school,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:52.500" end="00:47:54.867">which, I had tocheat my way through,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54.933" end="00:47:56.900">my dad ended up comingto me and saying listen,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:56.967" end="00:47:58.567">you're outta the house, andliterally kicked me out</p>
      <p begin="00:47:58.633" end="00:48:00.267">on the street withno food, no money.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:00.333" end="00:48:03.100">And so I'm literallysitting out on the curb,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:03.167" end="00:48:06.400">on Sherman Way, that bigtough rebellious teenager</p>
      <p begin="00:48:06.467" end="00:48:08.033">was balling her eyes out.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:08.100" end="00:48:11.900">And all of a sudden, thisum, beautiful black man</p>
      <p begin="00:48:11.967" end="00:48:15.100">came over to me andsays, are you alright?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15.167" end="00:48:18.867">What's wrong, why areyou crying sweetheart?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:18.933" end="00:48:20.500">"I have no moneyand I have no food</p>
      <p begin="00:48:20.567" end="00:48:22.267">and my dad kicked me out."</p>
      <p begin="00:48:22.333" end="00:48:25.533">He put his arm around meand I- I still to this day</p>
      <p begin="00:48:25.600" end="00:48:28.367">can tell you what thatembrace felt like,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:28.433" end="00:48:31.033">and he just saidbaby I can help you</p>
      <p begin="00:48:31.100" end="00:48:35.200">and I thought Jesus hascome to rescue me.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:35.267" end="00:48:38.467">You know I really thoughthe was gonna help me.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:38.533" end="00:48:41.033">And he said there's a manin the apartment complex</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.100" end="00:48:43.233">who would love tomake love to you.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.300" end="00:48:44.233">He lured me in.</p>

      <p begin="00:48:48.633" end="00:48:52.000">really nice,and you'll get $35.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:52.067" end="00:48:54.533">So, here I ama single mother,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:54.600" end="00:48:56.933">I've doneprostitution and stripping,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:57.000" end="00:48:59.133">now for sixyears I've had, uh,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:03.433">I've been at gunpoint, I'vehad stalkers try and kill me,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:03.500" end="00:49:06.500">cops try and bust me, I meanI've been in the mafia</p>
      <p begin="00:49:06.567" end="00:49:08.900">basically for six years.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:08.967" end="00:49:13.567">So, someone came to me says,girl, why don't you do porn?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:13.633" end="00:49:15.567">I said porn? What's that?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:15.633" end="00:49:18.900">It was a lot worse thanprostitution, like,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:18.967" end="00:49:20.367">there's a wholecrew around,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.433" end="00:49:22.100">they're all strokingthemselves going--</p>
      <p begin="00:49:22.167" end="00:49:25.300">It was just totally degradingand I went oh my gosh</p>

      <p begin="00:49:37.667" end="00:49:40.433">all the things that men abusedme with in prostitution</p>
      <p begin="00:49:40.500" end="00:49:44.133">I just like, let itout, on the screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:44.200" end="00:49:48.267">He just said roll it and it'slike here I am the newbie</p>
      <p begin="00:49:48.333" end="00:49:50.933">but I like, took over theentire scene, it was weird.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:51.000" end="00:49:51.933">I just went-Rrrraw!</p>

      <p begin="00:49:57.300" end="00:50:01.933">But at the end of the sceneit just ended and I had um,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:04.333">bodily fluids on my face,and they just kinda went</p>
      <p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:06.633">here's a rag and theyjust threw it and me</p>
      <p begin="00:50:06.700" end="00:50:10.000">and I just grabbedthe rag and went.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.067" end="00:50:11.433">And I didn't wantthem to see me cry,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:11.500" end="00:50:13.967">so I just kinda turnedmy face and I was like,</p>

      <p begin="00:55:36.300" end="00:55:37.700">to make you feel sorryfor me or anything</p>
      <p begin="00:55:37.767" end="00:55:39.533">but I had an extremelytough childhood,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:39.600" end="00:55:42.733">and um, I think I got verylost for many years.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:42.800" end="00:55:46.200">Um, I didn't know who Iwas, like many people.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:46.267" end="00:55:52.433">Um, I had a very warpedunderstanding of what love was.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:52.500" end="00:55:57.333">And um, I think because of alack of love in my life ora,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57.400" end="00:56:00.367">an inability to determinewhat love really is</p>
      <p begin="00:56:00.433" end="00:56:04.500">I saw sexualattention, as love.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:04.567" end="00:56:06.733">And when you've suffered a lotof sexual abuse in yourlife</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06.800" end="00:56:09.500">it's understandable I thinkwhy you would feel that way.</p>

      <p begin="00:56:12.633" end="00:56:14.533">at what pointI made the decision</p>
      <p begin="00:56:14.600" end="00:56:17.433">to be Tiffany Million is notsomething I could answer</p>
      <p begin="00:56:17.500" end="00:56:19.800">really in justone neat sentence.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:19.867" end="00:56:21.867">It's kind of acombination of things.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:22.900" end="00:56:26.633">Essentially the whole reasonthat I even got into</p>
      <p begin="00:56:26.700" end="00:56:28.433">that business to beginwith was because I was</p>
      <p begin="00:56:28.500" end="00:56:32.900">a single mother, likemany people, and um,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:32.967" end="00:56:37.333">I was living in SouthernCalifornia, I had no family,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:37.400" end="00:56:38.933">I didn't knowthat many people,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:39.000" end="00:56:40.600">her father wasn'thelping me with her,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:40.667" end="00:56:43.533">and it was pretty scary beinga single parent honestly,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:43.600" end="00:56:45.767">and so, I mean Ifigured, you know</p>
      <p begin="00:56:45.833" end="00:56:48.767">I had a choice: I couldwork eight hours a day,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:48.833" end="00:56:51.767">and commute an hour or twoeach way on the freeway,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:51.833" end="00:56:54.367">to make, seveneight dollars an hour,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:54.433" end="00:56:56.933">only to pay outhalf of that in taxes,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:57.000" end="00:56:59.767">and child care, and mydaughter's with you know</p>
      <p begin="00:56:59.833" end="00:57:01.767">heaven knows whoduring the day,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:01.833" end="00:57:05.233">or I could re-enter theadult entertainment industry</p>
      <p begin="00:57:05.300" end="00:57:07.400">'cause I'd been astripper years before.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:07.467" end="00:57:09.567">And then I thought, causeI'd always been kind of a fan</p>
      <p begin="00:57:09.633" end="00:57:12.233">of adult films, and I'd somany times I had looked</p>
      <p begin="00:57:12.300" end="00:57:14.833">at those movies anduh, I'd thought man,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:14.900" end="00:57:17.567">you know what I could do thatand I could do it better.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:17.633" end="00:57:19.967">You know. And so I thoughtwell heck, why not?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:20.033" end="00:57:21.767">I mean I didn't have aman in my life anymore,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:21.833" end="00:57:25.267">I left her father, and uh, Idefinitely needed the money,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:25.333" end="00:57:27.833">but really it justafforded me a way to,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:27.900" end="00:57:30.967">work as little as possible toget as much money as I could</p>
      <p begin="00:57:31.033" end="00:57:32.633">to be with my daughtercause that's all</p>
      <p begin="00:57:32.700" end="00:57:35.967">I really wanted I wanted mydaughter to have a greatlife,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.033" end="00:57:37.867">and a safe home, in agood neighborhood,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:37.933" end="00:57:39.467">with good childcare,and I wanted</p>
      <p begin="00:57:39.533" end="00:57:40.967">to spend as much timewith her as I could.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:41.033" end="00:57:43.767">And working in the adultfilm industry allowed me</p>
      <p begin="00:57:43.833" end="00:57:47.267">to work a day or two a weekand be with my daughter</p>
      <p begin="00:57:47.333" end="00:57:48.700">the rest of the weekand make more money</p>
      <p begin="00:57:48.767" end="00:57:50.033">than people thanworked, you know,</p>

      <p begin="00:57:52.367" end="00:57:54.533">What you do in pornfilms is not sex.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:54.600" end="00:57:55.967">I mean I knowyou're being penetrated,</p>

      <p begin="00:58:53.100" end="00:58:54.733">and I would go and Iwould eat and stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:58:54.800" end="00:58:56.067">and then everybody wouldgo to the after-parties</p>
      <p begin="00:58:56.133" end="00:58:58.533">and I'd be like nah, I'mgoing home and going to bed.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:58.600" end="00:58:59.533">(laughing)</p>
      <p begin="00:58:59.600" end="00:59:00.867">I've always been earlyto bed, early to rise.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:00.933" end="00:59:03.567">I never wanted to be apart of that scene and um,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:03.633" end="00:59:04.900">even when I wasworking in the movies</p>
      <p begin="00:59:04.967" end="00:59:06.900">I always kinda felt likea fly on the wall.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:06.967" end="00:59:08.833">Like I know mybody was involved,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:08.900" end="00:59:10.500">because,obviously, I was there.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:10.567" end="00:59:12.600">But I always had thisstrange feeling</p>
      <p begin="00:59:12.667" end="00:59:13.900">this real feelingof disconnect.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:13.967" end="00:59:15.767">Like I was uphere looking down.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:15.833" end="00:59:18.467">When my father died in94, uh like I said</p>
      <p begin="00:59:18.533" end="00:59:19.967">he left me a wholebunch of money,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:20.033" end="00:59:22.033">and I suddenly realizedthat I'm free.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:22.100" end="00:59:23.900">I don't have tobe her anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:23.967" end="00:59:26.000">And I walked away.And that was it.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:26.900" end="00:59:29.067">No one puts a gun toanybody's head to do this.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:29.133" end="00:59:31.400">If you're not warnedabout what's gonna happen</p>
      <p begin="00:59:31.467" end="00:59:33.000">then the person who didn'twarn you is the person who's</p>
      <p begin="00:59:33.067" end="00:59:35.500">guilty in that respect,but they're doing it</p>
      <p begin="00:59:35.567" end="00:59:37.733">for the one thing thatthey cannot deny.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:37.800" end="00:59:40.733">That absolute death-wish,for the recognition,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:40.800" end="00:59:42.500">validation, andcredibility.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:42.567" end="00:59:44.667">And they're welcome toit, but eventually</p>
      <p begin="00:59:44.733" end="00:59:47.733">their past will catch upto them and they have</p>
      <p begin="00:59:47.800" end="00:59:50.867">to be aware of the factthat X is forever.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:52.067" end="00:59:56.367">When I got into the business,um, I, did have a goal.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:56.433" end="00:59:58.933">It was my "crackedout" goal. (laughing)</p>
      <p begin="00:59:59.000" end="01:00:02.100">But I did have agoal to, be out,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:02.167" end="01:00:06.900">and retired, twenty-six, atthe latest twenty-seven.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:06.967" end="01:00:08.467">Um--</p>
      <p begin="01:00:09.833" end="01:00:11.567">And I was out,by twenty-four.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:13.167" end="01:00:17.967">I didn't leave the businessbecause uh, I wanted to.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:18.033" end="01:00:20.167">I left the businesscause I felt I HAD to.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:20.233" end="01:00:22.500">That it was theright thing to do.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:22.567" end="01:00:28.433">On November fourth, 1984,was the first headline,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:28.500" end="01:00:30.600">in the SanFrancisco Chronicle,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:30.667" end="01:00:34.000">regarding the heterosexualtransmission of AIDS.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:34.633" end="01:00:37.033">A good friend of mine,who was a mathematician</p>
      <p begin="01:00:37.100" end="01:00:39.433">had read the same articleI did and he came over</p>
      <p begin="01:00:39.500" end="01:00:41.167">to my house in theafternoon and he said</p>
      <p begin="01:00:41.233" end="01:00:44.600">"I've done some calculationsbased on the numbers,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:44.667" end="01:00:45.967">reported here in the story.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:46.033" end="01:00:48.533">And you're in the wrongplace at the wrong time.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:48.600" end="01:00:50.667">I want you to stop."</p>
      <p begin="01:00:50.733" end="01:00:52.467">I had three jobslined up for December,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:52.533" end="01:00:55.100">my wife said I don'twant you to do them.</p>
      <p begin="01:00:55.167" end="01:00:56.733">And my thinking was look,they're just trying</p>
      <p begin="01:00:56.800" end="01:00:58.800">to sell newspapers, that'swhat newspapers do,</p>
      <p begin="01:00:58.867" end="01:01:01.667">they scare you, and so I don'tthink the danger is</p>
      <p begin="01:01:01.733" end="01:01:04.600">that real, and I'm gonna goahead and do these jobs.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:04.667" end="01:01:06.167">So I went off andI did the three jobs.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:06.233" end="01:01:09.000">And when I came home,and we're about to go</p>
      <p begin="01:01:09.067" end="01:01:11.533">to bed, that night,she said to me</p>
      <p begin="01:01:11.600" end="01:01:12.933">"Do you think we should?"</p>
      <p begin="01:01:14.533" end="01:01:16.867">Should? Should what?Have sex?</p>
      <p begin="01:01:16.933" end="01:01:19.700">"Yeah, do you thinkwe should have sex?"</p>
      <p begin="01:01:20.167" end="01:01:22.433">And I said, what areyou talking about?</p>
      <p begin="01:01:22.500" end="01:01:24.100">And she said, and Ican quote you verbatim,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:24.167" end="01:01:25.533">I rememberedthis all this time.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:25.600" end="01:01:29.433">She said "Don't youthink it would be prudent,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:29.500" end="01:01:33.733">if one of us remainedalive, to raise the kids?"</p>
      <p begin="01:01:35.800" end="01:01:37.133">Pchew!</p>
      <p begin="01:01:38.133" end="01:01:39.967">That was the brick wall.</p>
      <p begin="01:01:40.033" end="01:01:43.933">Somebody had offered mea DVD deal, and I--</p>
      <p begin="01:01:44.000" end="01:01:45.467">I knew CD-ROMSdidn't do good,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:45.533" end="01:01:46.567">I knew the laserdisks didn't do good,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:46.633" end="01:01:48.067">and I thought,uh, this DVD thing,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:48.133" end="01:01:51.800">whatever it is, won't replacevideo, so I signed it</p>
      <p begin="01:01:51.867" end="01:01:53.600">without having a lawyerlook at it or anything,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:53.667" end="01:01:58.500">and by the time DVDs startedtaking over from videos,</p>
      <p begin="01:01:58.567" end="01:02:00.000">I looked at the contractand found out now</p>
      <p begin="01:02:00.067" end="01:02:04.000">they have my DVD rights,also had internet rights,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:04.067" end="01:02:06.133">and the companywasn't very good.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:07.567" end="01:02:09.900">And once I realized I wasn'tgonna make much money</p>
      <p begin="01:02:09.967" end="01:02:12.967">I stayed with EvilAngel my distributor,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:13.033" end="01:02:14.567">for as long as I could,then when they stopped</p>
      <p begin="01:02:14.633" end="01:02:15.733">doing videos that was it.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:15.800" end="01:02:18.500">The ones that do well, are outbecause they wanna be out,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:18.567" end="01:02:20.200">not because theyhad to get out.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:20.267" end="01:02:24.000">And, they have madetheir peace with what they did,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:24.067" end="01:02:26.200">and that showsin their bearing,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:26.267" end="01:02:28.567">and the way thatthey are, in the world.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:28.967" end="01:02:31.600">The money that I didsave up went really quick.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:31.667" end="01:02:35.667">Um, and then I wasjust, scraping by.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:35.733" end="01:02:41.000">And it was, um, it was theChristian community that</p>
      <p begin="01:02:41.067" end="01:02:43.600">really came alongsideme and helped me out.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:43.667" end="01:02:44.833">There would betimes when I was,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:44.900" end="01:02:46.867">didn't know how Iwas gonna pay my rent,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:46.933" end="01:02:50.867">and, somebody, it was justpeople I don't even know,</p>
      <p begin="01:02:50.933" end="01:02:54.100">just people who've read mystory, who wanted to help.</p>
      <p begin="01:02:54.300" end="01:02:56.667">When I left the businessI sold my house</p>
      <p begin="01:02:56.733" end="01:03:02.733">in Los Angeles, um, I first-I retired, and then,</p>
      <p begin="01:03:02.800" end="01:03:06.033">um, I decided, I needto get out of L.A.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:06.100" end="01:03:08.733">I neededto get out of L.A.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:08.800" end="01:03:13.633">I mean, everywhere Iwent, McDonalds drive-thru,</p>
      <p begin="01:03:13.700" end="01:03:18.100">um, nightclubs, the movietheatre, the park,</p>
      <p begin="01:03:18.167" end="01:03:21.567">Universal Studios,I mean, you name it,</p>
      <p begin="01:03:21.633" end="01:03:24.067">I could not, go anywhere.I mean I don't know</p>
      <p begin="01:03:24.133" end="01:03:26.067">how these big celebritiesdeal with it all.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:26.133" end="01:03:27.067">I mean they must ha--</p>
      <p begin="01:03:27.133" end="01:03:28.200">They have to havebodyguards of course</p>
      <p begin="01:03:28.267" end="01:03:31.700">and stuff like that causeI did not have bodyguards</p>
      <p begin="01:03:31.767" end="01:03:33.867">and I could nothandle it.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:33.933" end="01:03:36.767">It's impossible to lead a normallife after you get out of it.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:36.833" end="01:03:39.133">This is forever. Thisis the scarlet letter.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:39.200" end="01:03:41.533">And it, it never goes away,you'll be dealing with the,</p>
      <p begin="01:03:41.600" end="01:03:44.633">with the implicationsof this forever.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:44.700" end="01:03:46.233">What, (sigh),</p>
      <p begin="01:03:46.300" end="01:03:49.200">what tends to happen isthat it isolates you.</p>
      <p begin="01:03:49.267" end="01:03:54.733">And so you,develop a, a fear of,</p>
      <p begin="01:03:54.800" end="01:03:56.900">being rejected againand again and again</p>
      <p begin="01:03:56.967" end="01:03:59.633">and so you put up wallsbetween you and other people,</p>
      <p begin="01:03:59.700" end="01:04:02.933">and you isolate yourself andyou don't join communities,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:03.000" end="01:04:05.800">and, when you're isolatedyou're less likely</p>
      <p begin="01:04:05.867" end="01:04:06.933">to suffer rejection.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:07.000" end="01:04:09.133">But you're also isolatedand living on the edge</p>
      <p begin="01:04:09.200" end="01:04:12.267">so, um, you can neverget away from this,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:12.333" end="01:04:14.133">there's no solution.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:14.200" end="01:04:18.933">To go from beinguh, a movie star,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:19.000" end="01:04:21.667">to zippothe pinhead overnight,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:21.733" end="01:04:24.633">was just like,devastating to my ego.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:25.833" end="01:04:28.067">If you're looking for a longcareer in the porn business</p>
      <p begin="01:04:28.133" end="01:04:31.133">you're probablylooking in the wrong place.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:31.200" end="01:04:36.567">Uh, the average girl, mightbe good for, two years?</p>
      <p begin="01:04:36.633" end="01:04:40.867">Two to three years topsfor the average girl.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:40.933" end="01:04:43.933">If you're lucky and you'reone of the few superstars,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:44.000" end="01:04:45.767">not very many of those,okay then you get uh,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:45.833" end="01:04:47.767">you know, six sevenyears. Eight years.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:47.833" end="01:04:50.100">And if you playyour cards right,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:50.167" end="01:04:52.967">and do your financial thingright, then you can,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:53.033" end="01:04:55.800">you know, make some moneyand set yourself up.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:56.900" end="01:04:58.400">Overall I guessI'm happy I did it.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:58.467" end="01:05:00.767">I mean the only thing Idon't like is that, it,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:00.833" end="01:05:02.800">the main thing I reallywanted to do is act and be</p>
      <p begin="01:05:02.867" end="01:05:06.233">in comedies and tv, and Ifeel like it holds me back.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:06.300" end="01:05:08.067">But I don't know if Iwould have just stuck</p>
      <p begin="01:05:08.133" end="01:05:09.733">with the normal routeif I would've uh,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:09.800" end="01:05:11.000">ended up makingit to tv at all,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:11.067" end="01:05:12.900">who knows I'd probably,maybe still be</p>
      <p begin="01:05:12.967" end="01:05:14.433">in Florida goingto castings,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:14.500" end="01:05:16.233">maybe I never wouldhave come out here.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:16.300" end="01:05:18.067">So, and I've gotten to doa lot of Cinemax movies</p>
      <p begin="01:05:18.133" end="01:05:20.133">which are really fun too,and all those things</p>
      <p begin="01:05:20.200" end="01:05:22.767">I've gotten to do becauseof probably the porn.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:22.833" end="01:05:24.767">So overall I guessI'm happy I did it.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:24.833" end="01:05:26.900">Um, uh, part of the reasonwe're her in Utah is</p>
      <p begin="01:05:26.967" end="01:05:28.933">because porn isillegal here, so uh,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:29.000" end="01:05:31.067">it really helps keep mefrom being recognized.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:31.133" end="01:05:33.333">That and the fortyextra pounds I gained!</p>
      <p begin="01:05:33.400" end="01:05:36.933">But um, now that I'mlosing that weight, um,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:37.000" end="01:05:38.867">well I also cut off myhair so that helps too.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:38.933" end="01:05:40.200">But um.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:40.267" end="01:05:41.767">Yeah, everyone'sbeen really cool about,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:41.833" end="01:05:43.933">um, if theyfind out who I am.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:44.000" end="01:05:45.267">They've beenreally good about it.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:45.333" end="01:05:47.000">When I took Kattyto her new daycare</p>
      <p begin="01:05:47.067" end="01:05:50.333">and they asked, if I had um,reference names for like,</p>

      <p begin="01:05:53.900" end="01:05:55.833">and she thought that wasa little bit suspicious,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:55.900" end="01:05:57.300">and so shelooked me up online,</p>
      <p begin="01:05:57.367" end="01:06:01.367">I had given her thename Asia Lemon, um,</p>
      <p begin="01:06:01.433" end="01:06:03.100">and from that name shemanaged to figure out</p>
      <p begin="01:06:03.167" end="01:06:04.467">who I was and so thenext day she goes,</p>

      <p begin="01:06:17.200" end="01:06:19.467">Well you know,unfortunately like uh,</p>
      <p begin="01:06:19.533" end="01:06:22.167">one of the reasons I like--the fact that Vince Neal</p>

      <p begin="01:06:47.167" end="01:06:48.933">Politicians,on the other hand,</p>
      <p begin="01:06:49.000" end="01:06:51.000">who make us lookclean as hell,</p>

      <p begin="01:06:56.433" end="01:06:58.833">But because we have alittle sex once in a while,</p>
      <p begin="01:06:58.900" end="01:07:02.233">naw, can't do you andthat pissed me off.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:02.300" end="01:07:04.300">I had one interestingmoment in baseball</p>
      <p begin="01:07:04.367" end="01:07:05.300">with my son in little league.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:05.367" end="01:07:07.467">I had told nobodyabout my career,</p>
      <p begin="01:07:07.533" end="01:07:12.033">and uh, one day the manager,who was this big black guy</p>
      <p begin="01:07:12.100" end="01:07:15.033">who was a Stanford graduate,he comes up to me</p>
      <p begin="01:07:15.100" end="01:07:19.000">and he goes, "Gonna besome trouble today."</p>
      <p begin="01:07:19.067" end="01:07:20.100">And I said what do you mean?</p>
      <p begin="01:07:20.167" end="01:07:22.800">He says, "One of the mothersknows who's you are."</p>
      <p begin="01:07:22.867" end="01:07:25.467">He looks at me and he'ssays "You know I knew</p>

      <p begin="01:07:27.533" end="01:07:28.467">And he said I'lltell you the truth.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:28.533" end="01:07:30.133">He said "Anybody that's been</p>
      <p begin="01:07:30.200" end="01:07:32.467">in Nina Hartly's bootyis okay with me."</p>
      <p begin="01:07:32.533" end="01:07:35.333">(laughing) He says</p>
      <p begin="01:07:35.400" end="01:07:37.567">"I will take care of this."And he did.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:37.633" end="01:07:39.333">MENSA'sa high IQ society.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:39.400" end="01:07:43.467">You have to have an IQ in thetop two percent, to get in.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:43.533" end="01:07:47.000">I got in, with a notarizedcopy of my SAT scores.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:47.067" end="01:07:49.100">MENSA didn't want link tomy website even though</p>
      <p begin="01:07:49.167" end="01:07:51.067">they linked all themember's websites,</p>
      <p begin="01:07:51.133" end="01:07:53.067">because uh, of who Iwas, and adult star,</p>
      <p begin="01:07:53.133" end="01:07:56.100">um, so, thatwas their excuse,</p>
      <p begin="01:07:56.167" end="01:07:59.233">and so I made them a speciallittle webpage of Asia</p>
      <p begin="01:07:59.300" end="01:08:02.133">just like, happy Asia, collegepictures and smiling Asia</p>
      <p begin="01:08:02.200" end="01:08:04.533">and, just innocentstuff and it's two pages,</p>
      <p begin="01:08:04.600" end="01:08:07.367">and that's, so that'swhere MENSA links to now,</p>
      <p begin="01:08:07.433" end="01:08:09.033">instead of my regular site.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:09.100" end="01:08:10.433">And they finallyacknowledged me</p>
      <p begin="01:08:10.500" end="01:08:13.367">in their MENSA celebrityissue which was,</p>
      <p begin="01:08:13.433" end="01:08:15.933">a really big moment for me.That was cool.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:16.633" end="01:08:18.233">Wait,how do you say it?</p>
      <p begin="01:08:18.300" end="01:08:18.933">(inaudible)Unprecedented?</p>

      <p begin="01:08:20.100" end="01:08:21.000">Okay. (laughing)</p>
      <p begin="01:08:21.067" end="01:08:24.467">I've done somethingunprecedented that</p>

      <p begin="01:09:16.033" end="01:09:17.633">when I was gettingtowards the end of it</p>
      <p begin="01:09:17.700" end="01:09:19.400">I realized that youknow I really wanted</p>
      <p begin="01:09:19.467" end="01:09:21.533">to make a difference andI felt like I really was</p>
      <p begin="01:09:21.600" end="01:09:23.867">making a difference becauseI was getting a lot</p>

      <p begin="01:09:25.633" end="01:09:29.133">to follow, because of me.And um, you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:09:29.200" end="01:09:30.267">and then I was likewhat if I win?</p>
      <p begin="01:09:30.333" end="01:09:31.567">(laughing) But, you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:09:31.633" end="01:09:33.400">coming in tenth placeis pretty amazing</p>
      <p begin="01:09:33.467" end="01:09:34.933">out of a hundred andthirty-two people.</p>
      <p begin="01:09:35.000" end="01:09:37.067">When I was eighteenyears old, um,</p>
      <p begin="01:09:37.133" end="01:09:39.467">I went to uh, real-estateschool, just everything</p>
      <p begin="01:09:39.533" end="01:09:41.433">about real-estatejust I really liked,</p>
      <p begin="01:09:41.500" end="01:09:45.300">so I figured that I wouldalways, do something withthat.</p>
      <p begin="01:09:45.367" end="01:09:47.933">I was working fora builder, uh, a,</p>
      <p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:53.000">a home builder, here,and, corporate,</p>
      <p begin="01:09:53.067" end="01:09:56.300">came to my communityand shut the doors</p>
      <p begin="01:09:56.367" end="01:09:57.467">and said we needto talk to you.</p>
      <p begin="01:09:57.533" end="01:10:02.100">Someone recognized you,We know who you are,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:02.167" end="01:10:05.300">and you are toorecognizable and it's a,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:05.367" end="01:10:07.933">we're tooconservative of a company,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:08.000" end="01:10:10.000">and we're gonnahave to let you go.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:11.200" end="01:10:12.933">And so that wasright before,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:13.000" end="01:10:16.000">that was a week before Igot diagnosed with cancer.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:16.067" end="01:10:17.900">And the ones that gotout of this business</p>
      <p begin="01:10:17.967" end="01:10:21.167">and now are being blightedby the society that</p>
      <p begin="01:10:21.233" end="01:10:22.467">jacked off to them.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:22.533" end="01:10:25.167">Well the society are theones that's guilty for that.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:25.233" end="01:10:26.500">They're damning themfor something that</p>
      <p begin="01:10:26.567" end="01:10:28.167">gave them pleasure,but they refuse</p>
      <p begin="01:10:28.233" end="01:10:29.933">to admit that they gotthe pleasure from them.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:30.000" end="01:10:32.433">and that's a very verysad state of affairs.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:32.500" end="01:10:34.633">Now I wasstarting to direct,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:34.700" end="01:10:39.200">and I was hired, uh,a couple months later,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:39.267" end="01:10:40.433">to go to Germany to work.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:40.500" end="01:10:43.733">I'd make about eight grandor something like that.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:43.800" end="01:10:45.067">Work eight daysor something.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:45.133" end="01:10:47.667">And I didn't wanna dothis any more at this time,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:47.733" end="01:10:49.333">I didn't wannado it any more.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:49.400" end="01:10:52.167">So I left, said goodbyeto her, stood in line</p>
      <p begin="01:10:52.233" end="01:10:54.667">two hours, and as I'm goingI'm saying I don't wanna go,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:54.733" end="01:10:55.700">I'm saying to myselfI don't wanna go,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:55.767" end="01:10:57.400">I don't wanna go,I don't wanna--</p>
      <p begin="01:10:57.467" end="01:10:59.200">And it just built upand built up until I got,</p>
      <p begin="01:10:59.267" end="01:11:02.467">finally got tothe point of where,</p>
      <p begin="01:11:02.533" end="01:11:03.467">"May I help you?"</p>
      <p begin="01:11:03.533" end="01:11:05.700">they said, youknow, ticket counter,</p>
      <p begin="01:11:05.767" end="01:11:08.433">I said uh, no,I'm not going.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:08.500" end="01:11:11.567">(laughing) I took mybags, I call up Kathleen</p>
      <p begin="01:11:11.633" end="01:11:13.067">and I said babyI'm coming home,</p>
      <p begin="01:11:13.133" end="01:11:15.400">I don't wanna go, I don'twanna go to Europe.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:15.467" end="01:11:17.167">I'm thinking about thetrip and everything,</p>
      <p begin="01:11:17.233" end="01:11:20.000">I don't wanna do this, Iwanna stay home with her.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:20.067" end="01:11:22.333">So, that was prettymuch the last thing I did.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:22.400" end="01:11:24.500">Really what got meout of it was my husband.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:24.567" end="01:11:29.333">Because, when I metRon, he had no idea</p>
      <p begin="01:11:29.400" end="01:11:32.733">who I used to be.Ron loved me, for me.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:32.800" end="01:11:35.400">And you know he couldhad a much younger woman,</p>
      <p begin="01:11:35.467" end="01:11:37.233">he could had a muchbetter looking woman,</p>
      <p begin="01:11:37.300" end="01:11:39.233">he could had a womanwith a lot more money.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:39.300" end="01:11:41.067">But he fell in lovewith me.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:41.133" end="01:11:42.700">He didn't know anythingabout that part of me.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:42.767" end="01:11:45.467">And the fact that heaccepted me for who I was</p>
      <p begin="01:11:45.533" end="01:11:47.500">and loved mefor who I was--</p>
      <p begin="01:11:50.167" end="01:11:51.633">Taught me howto love me.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:52.367" end="01:11:53.300">Really.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:53.367" end="01:11:56.633">And his love for mehas reconnected me</p>
      <p begin="01:11:56.700" end="01:11:59.133">with the person thatI was before I EVER,</p>
      <p begin="01:11:59.200" end="01:12:00.433">did any of this crap.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:01.500" end="01:12:06.067">All of a sudden Mr. Right cameinto my life, and I hated him.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:06.133" end="01:12:08.100">Ha! When I first met him.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:08.167" end="01:12:09.733">His whole life he wasraised in Christian school</p>
      <p begin="01:12:09.800" end="01:12:12.567">from like, he went to thesame school, the same kids</p>
      <p begin="01:12:12.633" end="01:12:14.333">from like kindergartento like twelfth grade.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:14.400" end="01:12:17.533">He was like most valuableplayer, he did sports,</p>
      <p begin="01:12:17.600" end="01:12:19.067">his mom hadall these trophies.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:19.133" end="01:12:20.200">She hasa book this thick</p>
      <p begin="01:12:20.267" end="01:12:22.200">just on newspaperclippings on him.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:22.267" end="01:12:24.533">So I was like jealousalready I hated his guts.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:24.600" end="01:12:27.200">He would like knock on mydoor and I would answer</p>
      <p begin="01:12:27.267" end="01:12:28.200">and go,what do you want?</p>
      <p begin="01:12:28.267" end="01:12:29.533">and he goes "I'm hereto clean your house."</p>
      <p begin="01:12:29.600" end="01:12:32.000">And I'd be like,what are you doing?</p>
      <p begin="01:12:32.067" end="01:12:33.167">He goes "You're filthy."</p>
      <p begin="01:12:33.233" end="01:12:34.167">Ha!</p>
      <p begin="01:12:34.233" end="01:12:36.067">Like, cause I didn'tcook, and I didn't clean</p>
      <p begin="01:12:36.133" end="01:12:39.100">and I was, and I was,I was falling apart.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:39.167" end="01:12:41.233">So he literallycleaned my whole house.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:41.300" end="01:12:44.667">With rags for me, and um,I just stopped working.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:44.733" end="01:12:46.733">didn't wanna prostituteanymore and lie anymore</p>
      <p begin="01:12:46.800" end="01:12:48.800">and we just hit it off andthe next thing you know</p>
      <p begin="01:12:48.867" end="01:12:51.100">we're snorting meth, andnext thing you know</p>
      <p begin="01:12:51.167" end="01:12:52.233">we're reading thebible together.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:52.300" end="01:12:54.500">And we're like(sniff) dude!</p>
      <p begin="01:12:54.567" end="01:12:57.300">Did you see like how likeGod used Joshua like</p>
      <p begin="01:12:57.367" end="01:12:59.233">to conquer allthose cities dude.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:59.300" end="01:13:01.467">And he'd be like(sniff) yeah and (inaudible)--</p>
      <p begin="01:13:01.533" end="01:13:04.133">and like I, I mean we're werejust like so into the Bible!</p>
      <p begin="01:13:04.200" end="01:13:07.067">And we realized that he hadwent to Christian school</p>
      <p begin="01:13:07.133" end="01:13:09.567">his whole life and was thepastor's son so he had</p>
      <p begin="01:13:09.633" end="01:13:13.400">a really great Christianfoundation and,</p>
      <p begin="01:13:13.467" end="01:13:17.100">I didn't as much as himbut, he was so sweet</p>
      <p begin="01:13:17.167" end="01:13:20.400">and he never once pursuedme sexually, so, um,</p>
      <p begin="01:13:20.467" end="01:13:24.167">we ended up getting marriedon Valentine's Day, 1995.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:24.233" end="01:13:29.267">I met my husband in a pool,in Hollywood, Florida.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:29.333" end="01:13:32.467">At the Diplomat Hotel.And he was married</p>
      <p begin="01:13:32.533" end="01:13:36.233">at the time and I had aboyfriend at the time.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:36.300" end="01:13:38.633">And, he was in themiddle of splitting up</p>
      <p begin="01:13:38.700" end="01:13:41.367">and I was kindadone with it.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:41.433" end="01:13:42.367">Little Trist.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:42.433" end="01:13:45.467">And, I told him I wasin the middle of uh,</p>
      <p begin="01:13:45.533" end="01:13:48.833">putting a webpage together,and, he said oh okay,</p>
      <p begin="01:13:48.900" end="01:13:52.100">and, it had to be maybethree months after</p>
      <p begin="01:13:52.167" end="01:13:56.300">I got my first website up thatI got an email from him.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:56.367" end="01:13:57.633">We went out once,that was it.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:57.700" end="01:13:59.567">We haven'tbeen apart since.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:59.633" end="01:14:01.533">Um, my husband diedin a car accident</p>
      <p begin="01:14:01.600" end="01:14:03.267">driving homefrom Las Vegas.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:03.333" end="01:14:06.333">I had asked him not to dothis whole gig actually,</p>
      <p begin="01:14:06.400" end="01:14:07.600">um, I waseight months pregnant</p>
      <p begin="01:14:07.667" end="01:14:09.300">and I didn't want himaway from me that long,</p>
      <p begin="01:14:09.367" end="01:14:11.367">and uh, he's like"I gotta do it honey",</p>
      <p begin="01:14:11.433" end="01:14:13.300">but he tried, he cutit down to two days</p>
      <p begin="01:14:13.367" end="01:14:15.233">so he was really happy cominghome on the second day</p>
      <p begin="01:14:15.300" end="01:14:16.700">that he wasall done with this</p>
      <p begin="01:14:16.767" end="01:14:19.133">and he came racing hometo be with his pregnant wife</p>
      <p begin="01:14:19.200" end="01:14:21.867">and he flipped the jeep anddidn't ever make it home.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:22.200" end="01:14:24.133">Suddenly he's goneand now here I am,</p>
      <p begin="01:14:24.200" end="01:14:26.133">no more income andall these bills to pay</p>
      <p begin="01:14:26.200" end="01:14:28.200">and it was just like onething on top of another.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:28.267" end="01:14:31.467">And so I, I just, I putup a plea on my website</p>
      <p begin="01:14:31.533" end="01:14:33.367">asking, uh, for donations.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:33.433" end="01:14:35.200">I didn't knowwhat else to do.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:35.267" end="01:14:36.700">No insurance,no money, bills,</p>
      <p begin="01:14:36.767" end="01:14:41.500">and my fans donated,enormous amounts of money.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:41.567" end="01:14:42.867">Um, the kids werecompletely spoiled,</p>
      <p begin="01:14:42.933" end="01:14:44.533">they got toys andbooks and presents</p>
      <p begin="01:14:44.600" end="01:14:47.467">and stuff with pictureson it and just it was,</p>
      <p begin="01:14:47.533" end="01:14:49.200">unbelievable it wouldmake me cry all the time</p>
      <p begin="01:14:49.267" end="01:14:50.500">I would open all the mailfrom all these people</p>
      <p begin="01:14:50.567" end="01:14:52.233">I'd never met and itwas just, it was</p>
      <p begin="01:14:52.300" end="01:14:54.833">really wonderful havingfans turn out to help me.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:54.900" end="01:14:56.433">Because you know, I'dbeen online for ten years,</p>
      <p begin="01:14:56.500" end="01:14:57.700">they'd watched grow upand I'd never asked</p>
      <p begin="01:14:57.767" end="01:14:59.567">for anything before andhere I was I needed help.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:59.633" end="01:15:00.700">And they helped me.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:00.767" end="01:15:04.467">I faced those up and,up and downs many times.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:04.533" end="01:15:06.767">Certainly with myreal-estate practice</p>
      <p begin="01:15:06.833" end="01:15:09.667">and the market and when themarket dropped in real-estate,</p>
      <p begin="01:15:09.733" end="01:15:12.167">and now that themarket and, you know,</p>
      <p begin="01:15:12.233" end="01:15:13.600">is dropping all theway across the board</p>
      <p begin="01:15:13.667" end="01:15:15.267">I mean the countryis in crisis.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:15.333" end="01:15:17.167">Our wholecountry is in crisis.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:17.233" end="01:15:20.533">It would be reallyeasy for me right now,</p>
      <p begin="01:15:20.600" end="01:15:25.633">to want to reinvestigate,you know, porn.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:26.467" end="01:15:27.533">I definitelywanna have kids.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:27.600" end="01:15:29.533">That's something like, Iwas actually very depressed</p>
      <p begin="01:15:29.600" end="01:15:31.900">recently because I,I'm realizing that</p>
      <p begin="01:15:31.967" end="01:15:33.367">I'm twenty years oldand I'm not married</p>
      <p begin="01:15:33.433" end="01:15:35.767">and I have no kids. AndI really want kids.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:35.833" end="01:15:38.633">And, I'd like to have atleast two. Maybe three.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:38.700" end="01:15:40.567">Because being an onlychild I always wished</p>
      <p begin="01:15:40.633" end="01:15:41.567">I had a brother or sister.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:41.633" end="01:15:42.833">I still wish I had abrother or sister.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:42.900" end="01:15:44.900">Like, you know I just,that's something</p>

      <p begin="01:16:10.733" end="01:16:15.467">She, um, hates it.She's embarrassed of it.</p>
      <p begin="01:16:15.533" end="01:16:18.367">And, um, she won't letme, she doesn't want me</p>

      <p begin="01:16:53.300" end="01:16:54.267">It's interesting.</p>
      <p begin="01:16:54.333" end="01:16:56.300">I mean, what I'm sittinghere thinking is, I wonder</p>
      <p begin="01:16:56.367" end="01:16:58.533">how many other people outthere can have this kind</p>
      <p begin="01:16:58.600" end="01:16:59.800">of conversation withtheir parents.</p>
      <p begin="01:16:59.867" end="01:17:01.367">I mean most people can'tsit around and think</p>
      <p begin="01:17:01.433" end="01:17:04.267">about their parentshaving sex, or, um,</p>
      <p begin="01:17:04.333" end="01:17:06.333">especially fucking somebodyother than their mother.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:06.400" end="01:17:07.600">I mean that alonewould I think</p>
      <p begin="01:17:07.667" end="01:17:08.633">irritate a lotof children.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:08.700" end="01:17:11.900">But, it's very, normalized,in that sex is</p>
      <p begin="01:17:11.967" end="01:17:13.733">a goody thatshould be enjoyed.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:13.800" end="01:17:16.433">Um, and when you candifferentiate between sex</p>
      <p begin="01:17:16.500" end="01:17:19.800">and love and everythingthat happens in between,</p>
      <p begin="01:17:19.867" end="01:17:22.267">um, it's a huge giftthat you can give yourself,</p>
      <p begin="01:17:22.333" end="01:17:25.500">and lovers and partnersand friends and family.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:25.567" end="01:17:29.700">And I'm grateful thatthat's, that's my world.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:30.733" end="01:17:31.733">Wow.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:33.400" end="01:17:34.400">I'm impressed.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:35.833" end="01:17:40.467">She, is my role model.She is my hero.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:40.533" end="01:17:43.833">And, I think Ilearned a lot from my mom.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:43.900" end="01:17:46.633">She's gone through a lotand I even tell people that</p>
      <p begin="01:17:46.700" end="01:17:49.000">she's my hero andshe's my role model.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:49.067" end="01:17:50.700">She's just like whatever,I did it for my daughter</p>
      <p begin="01:17:50.767" end="01:17:53.333">and now she's doing whatshe wants to she owns</p>
      <p begin="01:17:53.400" end="01:17:55.900">her own business, and nomatter how many people</p>
      <p begin="01:17:55.967" end="01:17:57.567">talk down about hershe's still does what</p>
      <p begin="01:17:57.633" end="01:17:59.300">she wants to do andshe's successful at it.</p>
      <p begin="01:17:59.367" end="01:18:02.967">So, I guess she'sjust a good example of,</p>
