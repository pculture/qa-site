2
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:26,633
(toddler talk)

3
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,167
Uh, we don't getTV in this house,

4
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,833
um, we all havecomputers.

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,700
My daughter and my sonare three and two

6
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,367
and they each havetheir own computers,

7
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:37,200
and they're lined up nextto mommy's computers,

8
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:41,733
and um, my little girl isreally really super smart.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,933
She can use acomputer really well,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,033
she surfs around this, onlineand she uses photoshop

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,067
she uses word, I meanshe's only three years old

12
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,233
and she can read andwrite and use a computer

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,067
just like an adult,she's pretty amazing.

14
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,367
I didn't planto be a single mom.

15
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,733
I didn't plan to be stuckin the middle of the desert

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
where I don'tknow anybody,

17
00:00:57,867 --> 00:00:59,167
it's just kind of allbeen thrown for a loop.

18
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,667
(gun shots)

19
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:05,900
So at that pointI said we gotta arrest him,

20
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:09,033
so we arrested him, and hecried like a baby, didn't he.

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,033
"I can't go back to jail!Ahhhhhhhh!"

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,033
and he justcried like a baby.

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,100
I said okay.

24
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,400
I gave him the opportunityto make very small

25
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,667
reasonable payments, he didn'tmake any of the payments,

26
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:20,100
I warned him if he didn'tmake the payments

27
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,867
I was gonna comeand take his grandma's car.

28
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,200
That's what he forced usto do, and the day that

29
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:27,133
I took this car his little87-year-old grandma

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
or mother was outthere with her walker

31
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,367
watching ustake her car.

32
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:31,767
And it was oneof the hardest things

33
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,233
I've ever had to dobut you know what?

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,700
Business isbusiness.

35
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:34,800
(gun shot)

36
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:40,033
So. Now the clay ispretty much conditioned,

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,967
it's readyto be worked with.

38
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:45,033
We're gonna giveourselves, a base,

39
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,133
and then uh, he willbe put into action.

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,767
I would see if hecan find a girlfriend.

41
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,800
Since he's gone throughout thisradical surgicalprocedure,

42
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:56,200
to have his penisre-installed.

43
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,100
Imagine how happy he iswhen he wakes up

44
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,933
and finds out,he's got a dick again.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,933
Wow, you knowthat's a,

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,367
that's a big dayin the coyote's life.

47
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:05,367
Huh?!

48
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:07,233
And I knew that,getting this opportunity to be

49
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,067
on a mainstream show,I knew my whole life,

50
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:13,300
like, once I got out to LA,once I could get on a

51
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,933
reality show, and get theopportunity to show people,

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,100
like, about me, that thatwould be the big thing

53
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,200
I need to moveforward mainstream.

54
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,333
I just need that oneopportunity to get there.

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,333
No! What happens isit like, it like,

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,133
like, you're tryingto put it in it like bends.

57
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,100
And you, it's betterif it's like a solid one.

58
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,500
That's realityright there.

59
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,767
No, I'm not kidding.

60
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:35,000
But, like, one like this, thenit doesn't, it goes faster.

61
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,000
(laughing)

62
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:39,133
And he comes from,of course the uh,

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
story of the old testament,the story of Josean.

64
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:45,333
Um, and this is kind of amodern day adaptation ofthat.

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
(unintelligibleconversation)

66
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:47,867
That is amazing,

67
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,200
that is amazing and Godbless you and take care.

68
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,300
I'm definitely stillgrowing spiritually.

69
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,133
I don't think youcan ever quit growing.

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,300
There's always roomto get closer to God

71
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:01,100
and things to learnabout him and...

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,333
ways to change yourlife and to improve.

73
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,033
It is a mess.

74
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,867
You're a mess.

75
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:09,767
It's a mess.

76
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,767
(laughing)

77
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,833
But that's the waygnocchis are.

78
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,200
A little bit of a mess.

79
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:16,367
It's like, a guy told me once,when he was painting.

80
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:19,333
Is that how you, how it was morebasic and then he went in.

81
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,067
Well it wasn't more basic,it was just a painting I did

82
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,833
and then one day I tookit out and I just

83
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,000
started painting all thisother stuff in there

84
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,833
and just went inwith this reds and...

85
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,267
I don't, I don't rememberwhat it looked like before,

86
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,200
I can't remember,I just, very hard to keep

87
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,433
a band togetherand I only wanna play

88
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,533
with certain guys thatI really love playing with.

89
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,567
Cause it allcomes together,

90
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,033
it's like summertheatre you know.

91
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,300
Wow!

92
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:42,300
I got a barn,and I got to, I got to ,

93
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,933
I got the instruments,we'll put our own show on!

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,933
You knowwhat I mean.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,833
It all still has that,that element.

96
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,467
This is uh, oneof the Chinatown series.

97
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:55,067
From my home town.After the mill closed.

98
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,800
I mean,pretty much closed.

99
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:57,833
What'd you get last year,

100
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,167
for your birthday,from Aunt Lynny?

101
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,833
I thinka Power Ranger suit.

102
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,333
You got what?No, you didn't!

103
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,133
You didn't get a Power Rangersuit that was for Halloween.

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,467
You got anelectric guitar--

105
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:07,967
A 'lectric guitar--

106
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:10,267
A REAL electric guitar!

107
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,233
Why? Because you toldaunt Lynny you wanted

108
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,933
to grow upto be a rockstar.

109
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,800
You know what, I justsee a beautiful girl

110
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,467
and I justwanna hug her!

111
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:19,533
(laughing)

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,167
Well, I love this one righthere, so I telling you.

113
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:23,967
I currently reach outto women and men

114
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,233
in the sex industryand the porn industry

115
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,033
and I absolutely lovepulling them out of the pit

116
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,567
the porn industry pit.

117
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:37,000
It's 1800 square feetand, the guest house is

118
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,433
around 600square feet.

119
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,467
That little garage area,I don't know.

120
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:45,433
Um, it took me about a yearto really get serious

121
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,233
about studying, and,it took me three times

122
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,267
to pass the testbut I did it and,

123
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,200
(deep breath),here I am.

124
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:56,200
(laughing)

125
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:57,867
Got into real-estate,

126
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,633
I've been in itfor five years.

127
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,200
Yup.

128
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,867
Dark and mild.

129
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,367
No, he likesthe dark heavy.

130
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,433
Dark heavy.

131
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,533
When I'm at home, I runaround with no makeup on,

132
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,533
a pair of sweatpants,bare foot, a t-shirt,

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,133
and I'm usually outin the yard digging.

134
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,400
Because I liketo plant things,

135
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,933
I like to grow things.Or decorating my house.

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,633
I like to do crafty things,like, you know, I don't,

137
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,100
I know I don't seem likethe domestic goddess!

138
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,267
But I, I, I like to makethings for the house

139
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:35,933
and I love to cook.And, I'm a very good cook.

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,133
I had a little bit,of, a, some bad terrible

141
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,067
terrible news,uh, this April.

142
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:47,467
Um, I was diagnosed with uh,stage three melanoma cancer.

143
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:49,567
So for the pastfour or five months

144
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:52,333
I've been dealingwith that and on chemo.

145
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,367
They recommended completedissection of thelymph-nodes,

146
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:59,000
and then to be onheavy-dose interferon,

147
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,933
which would beuh, intravenous,

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,867
which I would getfive times a week,

149
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,400
for the first month,and then after that,

150
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:09,433
three times a week,for eleven months,

151
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,300
for the restof the year.

152
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:14,667
And um, it's,it's been tough.

153
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,100

164
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,333
Oh god, she was um, oh thatdoesn't make any difference.

165
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,667
She was living here fora long time she was so hot.

166
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,633
(unintelligibleconversation)

167
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,167
Oh yeah, she justmoved outta town,

169
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,933
And uh, that's the only thingI missed out on in life.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,933
I've done, prettymuch everything I wanted.

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,300
I did wanna have kids,didn't have the opportunity

172
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:56,400
to meet the right womanthe right time,

173
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,033

174

177
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:09,633
but um, nobodygets everything.

178
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:20,567
♪

179
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,500
I started modelingin ninth grade.

180
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,233
My mom put methrough modeling school,

181
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,100
I graduatedfrom modeling school,

182
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,633
started doingbeauty pageants,

183
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,433
and model searches,and bikini contests.

184
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,633
So, I was exposed, to,not so much the adult industry

185
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,967
but just knowing that I couldmake money with my body.

186
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,033
I had a roommateat the time,

187
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,700
um, that was a dancer,and she knew an agent,

188
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,400
his name wasJim Salf.

189
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:53,033
He said, "Hey, there's aproducer that saw yourpicture

190
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,600
and he'd like youto come do a movie

191
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,733
how would you liketo do a movie?"

192
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,533
And I said, uh, well,I've never done a movie before

193
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,733
but sure, I coulddo it, no problem.

194
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,167
I went down and I hadbraids like Bo Derek

195
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,667
at the time and,did my first scene.

196
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,500
It was a three-way.

197
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:11,533
I had never even,been with a woman,

198
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,200
I didn't know whatto do with a woman,

199
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:16,500
I had, no ideawhat I was doing.

200
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,400
But the minutethose lights hit me,

201
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,767
I swear that was whereI was supposed to be.

202
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,567
Everyone said doit, do it, do it.

203
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,433
And the more you do themore money you can make

204
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,267
dancing on the dance circuit,the more magazines you cando,

205
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,200
the more you'reexposed, you can,

206
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:34,267
I mean gosh,I have a sex toy line,

207
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,767

208
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,767

You know,sign me up! Sure!

211
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,167
I was just having a blast,I mean, there were fans

212
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:51,100
lined up for miles andmiles and miles that flew,

213
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,467
I mean some people camefrom Poland and Berlin,

214
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,700
and come to think of itwhen I went to Poland,

215
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:59,700
to um, signautographs and whatever,

216
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:02,433
I mean, when I got off theplane I needed a body guard!

217
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,733
I mean, for a porn star to bethat big, around the world,

218
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,133
I mean, it was un-believable,I mean felt like a--

219
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,533
I was a true super star!

220
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,633
I mean people, wereknocking each other down.

221
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,067
Heeeere's Houston!!!!

222
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:25,100
(cheering)

223
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,233
Over the Dali Lamain the newspaper,

224
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,567
I was the headliner.I mean, that's unbelievable.

225
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:35,133
I was still under contract,I was with Metro Productions

226
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,733
for a few years, and they'rethe ones that also produced

227
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,067
uh, the Houston 500, theworld's biggest gang-bang.

228
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:45,600
Um, at that point when Ifirst signed with Metro,

229
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:50,233
it was already known going inthat I was gonnatakeover,

230
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,233
uh, Jasmine Saint-Clair'stitle and do this gang-bang.

231
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,733
So, going into mycontract with Metro,

232
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,833
I already knew that Iwas gonna be doing that,

233
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,733
so, I wasn't, I wasn'tlooking for things to,

234
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,467
oh I've gotta bemore crazy and wild,

235
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:11,200
you know honestly it justall came to me naturally.

236
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,533
Like, I mean,I had a labiaplasty,

237
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,233
and that was before alot of women even knew

238
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,400
that they can gettheir labia trimmed

239
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:21,733
if you have larger labialips and you know,

240
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,667
when I did that it was like,oh, it was just a no brainer

241
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:28,133
I'm gonna encase that inlucite and auction it.

242
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,167
The trimmings.

243
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,700
I mean, it's justthings just came to me,

244
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:34,833
I was just apublicity whore.

245
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,400
I was good at it.

246
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:39,700
I had invested mymoney, uh, I bought a home,

247
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:43,733
as well as, um, put a lotof money in mutual funds,

248
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,500
and many years ago whenthe stock market went kaput,

249
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:51,367
I lost, like,almost all my savings.

250
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,800
And that hurt me.

251
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:55,400
Um, but I did still have myhouse that I owned in LA,

252
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:59,100
um, and then when things gotrough of course I sold it,

253
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,200
not for financial reasonsbut when I wanted

254
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:02,767
to get outof the industry.

255
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,800
I'm professor ofcommunications studies

256
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,467
and psychology at UCLA.

257
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:13,633
I study a variety of topics,but one of the major areas

258
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,500
that I study ispornography.

259
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:20,233
I'm Faith, and since 1984I've done about 600 films.

260
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,400
About a thousandscenes, give or take.

261
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:25,300
Um, I've won severaldozen awards for acting

262
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:28,800
in sex performances and fanfavorite and this and that.

263
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:33,233
I think it might be up, thisyear for best non-sex role

264
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,467
cause I've also moved into theoccasional character part

265
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,433
that doesn't involvehaving sex.

266
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
I write about the sexindustry pretty much

267
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:46,700
from the fall of 1995until the fall of 2007.

268
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:50,133
"The History of X: OneHundred Years of Sex inFilm"

269
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,767
is the nameof my first book.

270
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,767
I've been in the adultentertainment industry

271
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,200
for basically 35, 36years, in every capacity.

272
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:59,867
I started as awriter, became an actor,

273
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:04,600
director, agent, and nowI'm sorta the, papa bear

274
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,767
to the adult entertainmentindustry, protecting

275
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,633
adult welfare, which I run,and, watch over the overaged

276
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,333
juvenile delinquentsand what I refer to as

277
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,400
the playpen of the damned,which is the X-ratedindustry.

278
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,867
What we give them in theadult entertainment industry

279
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:21,233
for a brief shinymoment is immortality,

280
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,767
validation, and credibility.

281
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,267
Every one of us, nomatter how insignificant

282
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,633
we may think we are,wants to be recognized

283
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,667
at one time or anotherin our lives,

284
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,667
and when you went to thoseconventions they lined up

285
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,567
at your booth like theywere getting signatures

286
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,600
from professionalathletes.

287
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:40,567
My parents divorced.My dad took us far away

288
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,633
from our mother, andran away with us.

289
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,467
He becamean alcoholic.

290
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:45,867
Then I moved inwith my mom

291
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,567
and the familyrelationship changed, um,

292
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,233
I felt kind of lost.

293
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,833
I worked a regularjob, um, in an office,

294
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,533
for five years, but whileI was doing those things

295
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,667
I also found um,a modeling website

296
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,267
and I put my pictureson the website,

297
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,533
and then um, you know, I wasstill working in the office

298
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,767
but people were emailingme about doing shoots.

299
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,433
And I thought itwould be cool to do,

300
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,300
like, bikini stuff, or,even though I never really

301
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,333
even walked around in bikinisI thought it would be,

302
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,233
kind of neat.

303
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,667
So, eventually, I didtake a job, um doing,

304
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,767
um, you know theywere only asking me

305
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,767
to do nudes and eventuallyI just did it.

306
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:38,333
I went to my firstshoot, in like a hotel room,

307
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,433
and um, it was justsupposed to be topless,

308
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,567
and it, was, itwas really scary.

309
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:45,533
Um--

310
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,467
It was weird.

311
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:52,667
Well ever since I, sinceI got into the business,

312
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,667
I always got emails,that said that you,

313
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,400
you don't lookquite comfortable,

314
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,967
and I think that itwas the innocence,

315
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:04,433
that, attracted my,a lot of my fans,

316
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,933
is that I didn't look totallycomfortable in anything I did,

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,533
and even if I wasspeaking I didn't look

318
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,800
totally comfortable and Inever looked confident,

319
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,867
I wasn't very verbal,I wasn't, you know,

320
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:17,333
over the top with thenoises or anything, um.

321
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,000
I dunno, I just started feeling,really depressed about it.

322
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:23,933
Honestly.

323
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,733
And, then I hitrock bottom myself,

324
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,833
emotionally, where Ium, got really upset

325
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,467
and I'd go in the bathroomand I threw a glass

326
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,833
on the ground and thenI um, just crying

327
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,267
and fall to the groundand just started like,

328
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,533
pounding my wrists intothe glass, and blood was,

329
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,800
just started goingeverywhere, and...

330
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,533
I dunno, I justkinda lost that hope.

331
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:53,433
I did have a stalker,um, he started off

332
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,900
just sending mehate-mail.

333
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,333
He's an atheist, sohe was pretty much,

334
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,567
putting downwhat I believe in

335
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,000
and trying to getme to debate him.

336
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,667
He, heh, becameobsessed with me

337
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:08,000
and developed likethis, crush on me.

338
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,633
And then I told himwe would never date,

339
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
I don't know you Idon't know where you live,

340
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,833
you're too young,blah blah blah.

341
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,667
And um, he flipped out.

342
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:18,800
(nervous laughing)

343
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,500
The thing that pushed meto the edge

344
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,800
was he said he wasgonna, um, he wanted

345
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,500
to bash my headinto the concrete

346
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,467
until my brainsspilled out.

347
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,867
And then kill my catand stuff like that.

348
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:32,033
A few fans had emailedme the last year or so

349
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,700
and said they werepraying for me

350
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,833
and that they were notlooking at porn anymore,

351
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,567
and, you know, and then Ihad this other guy saying

352
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:41,333
you need to put awarning on your website

353
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,633
because kidscan see this

354
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,300
my fourteen-year-old sonfound this, and then--

355
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,633
Just all kinds ofpeople were like,

356
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,800
sending me these emails,random emails and--

357
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:51,500
You know it uh, andof course I would,

358
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,000
I was alwayskind of sympathetic

359
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:56,933
to whatever they saidbut, um, there was some,

360
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,700
you know I was stillkind of hardened too,

361
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,600
at the same time,because I was like well,

362
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,067
I can't do anything else,this is what I'm good at.

363
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,900
This is all that,I know.

364
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:09,100
And, I kind ofbelieved it at the time.

365
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,933
I didn't haveanybody you know,

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,433
saying, you'rebetter than that.

367
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,467
So, um...(nervous laughing)

368
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,967
Some adult stars do"find god" and leave,

369
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:21,733
but those arepeople who needed,

370
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,567
who needed to be goneanyway, and did not have

371
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:25,967
the personal strength todo it and so they do

372
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,567
look outside for somethingto help them leave.

373
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:29,933
Um, there are plenty ofpeople in the business

374
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,867
who really shouldn't behere, because they have

375
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:35,067
conflict about-- ifI was-, if I'd been raised

376
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:38,133
to be ashamed of mybody, and to feel bad

377
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,700
about men and their andthe horrible desires,

378
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,933
but, did porn for other reasonseventually those two things

379
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,800
are gonna co-, wheels aregonna come off the bus.

380
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,033
I can only deny it solong, people try to deny,

381
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,533
they stuff theirfeelings with, with drugs,

382
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
and alcohol, or whatever it isthey stuff their feelings with

383
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,633
and after a six months,one year, five year,

384
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,000
ten years, whatever itfinally goes you know what?

385
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,133
I can't do this anymore.

386
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Because for religion andespecially western religion,

387
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:04,000
especially Christianitysays I love you,

388
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:05,833
I forgive you, youcan come home now.

389
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,633
And I will not push you out.

390
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,100
And so that is incrediblypowerful and incredibly potent

391
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:15,767
to have someone finallysay I don't shame you.

392
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,800
I love you.

393
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,900
You're welcome here.

394
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:20,433
Sign me up!

395
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,767
When you're involvedin this industry

396
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,167
you lose your humanity.

397
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,067
You're no longer treatedas a human being

398
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:28,167
by eighty percent ofpeople out there.

399
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:29,967
You're now, now scum.

400
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:33,167
Like they maybe wanna, docertain things with you.

401
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:35,067
But then, you're still scum.

402
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:37,633
And, like if, they maybe thrilled to have

403
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,733
a roll in the sac withyou but when they leave,

404
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,733
when you leave they'regonna wanna burn the sheets.

405
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,967
Uh, ah, I got intoporn by accident.

406
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:47,133
It wasn't somethingI planned on doing,

407
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,633
uh, probably mighta beenthe, the least likely thing

408
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,467
I thought I woulda done.

409
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:53,867
I was singing inbands after I,

410
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:55,800
a baseball thingdidn't work out,

411
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,800
uh, I knew I could sing so Istarted singing in rock bands.

412
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:01,767
And of course like allstruggling musicians

413
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,400
you gotta make a littleextra dough on the side.

414
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:07,733
It actually, my, my first nakedjob I was a nude artmodel

415
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,567
for like you know college artclasses and stuff like that.

416
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:12,733
And I was really kinda shybut not about my body

417
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,500
just about talking I waskinda shy about talking.

418
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:16,733
but yeah I'd get nakedin front of people

419
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,100
so I did that and a couplegirls in one of the classes

420
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,000
asked to take some picturesof me and they did and--

421
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,900
They came out pretty good andthey said can we send them

422
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:26,133
to some magazines I said Idon't care do what you want.

423
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,433
And they sent'em out andand next thing I know

424
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,667
I got a letter from Playgirl,and, but High Society

425
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,800
said they like to do a boy/girlthing but I said alright.

426
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,767
So it was the firstthing I ever did.

427
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,400
And they had a womaneditor and at the end

428
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:38,633
of the shoot she goesyou know uh,

429
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,900
I noticed you were taking careof business pretty good,

430
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:43,033
did you ever think aboutdoing a porn movie

431
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,800
cause I gotsome connections.

432
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:47,200
And I go, I never reallythought about it, no.

433
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:50,800
She goes well you know, I think,I can get you 250 bucks.

434
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:53,067
Like, 250 bucks man!

435
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,933
1978 that wassome good cash,

436
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,467
that's what Iwas making a week!

437
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,667
So I said uh, alrightI'll try it, you know.

438
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,700
So I did it and uh,guess I was good at it

439
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,033
cause they keptcalling me back.

440
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,600
And uh, that's kindahow it got started.

441
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,933
I, I used to say it's likeborrowing somebody's body

442
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,067
to masturbate with.

443
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,767
Uh, excuse me, if you'renot busy do you mind

444
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,867
if I jerk off in yourpussy with my dick?

445
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:17,067
Uh, it's kinda likethat, which it's not bad,

446
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:20,833
I mean you know, betterthan real jerkin' off, but--

447
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,567
When I first startedproducing up-and-comers

448
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,833
I get this letter in themail and I open it up

449
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,533
and I see this unbelievably,good-looking,

450
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,067
very younglooking blonde girl,

451
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,967
with beautifulnatural boobs,

452
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:36,733
little baby face, andshe wants to know

453
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,600
if I can help her getin the porn biz.

454
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,567
Girl's name wasJenna Jameson.

455
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:42,933
I remember saying thisI mean holy christ

456
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
if I get this girlto shoot for me

457
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,700
we're gonna sellsome tapes.

458
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,033
I said well if you don'twanna do guys you know

459
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,500
I'll let you pickwhatever girl you want

460
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,700
if you wanna do that.And she liked girls.

461
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,833
so she picked this girl that Ihappened to be working with

462
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,533
that day who was doing herfirst movie, Kylie Ireland,

463
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,567
so Kylie and Jenna weredoing their thing together

464
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:03,533
and uh, everything wasgoing good, and they took

465
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,267
a little break and whilethey were lying there I--

466
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,700
I think I said something like,

467
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:10,200
man Jenna that's a tastylooking pussy you got.

468
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:13,567
And I believe she said wellwhy don't you come in

469
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,600
and taste it.

470
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,167
I went--

471
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:18,100
Okay, I was doing thecamera but I handed it

472
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:23,133
to my assistant, Bob holdonto this, start shooting.

473
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,167
So I get in there and Istart going down on her

474
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,700
and she starts squealing thatlittle squeal that she had

475
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,200
and um, I'm guessing she'skinda liking it you know,

476
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:32,933
and seemed like she was gettingoff and everything's good

477
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,633
and I said man, I amso fuckin' horny now.

478
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,233
I said would youguys mind maybe like,

479
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,867

480
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:42,567
And they said sure, we cando that, and I'm like--

481
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:43,800
Thank you, thank you!

482
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:48,100
And they did and it wentwell and a week later

483
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,133
she kinda called me backand said you know what

484
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,800
you weren't so bad I thinkI could probably do

485
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,200
a boy girl thing withyou and the rest is

486
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:55,867
kinda history after that.

487
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:58,600
Getting "It's a DaddyThing" number three!

488
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,533
Old man, canmake a comeback!

489
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,567
Yeah!

490
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:03,867
So there baby,no viagra yet!

491
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:08,000
Um, and it, you know,it's cool you do your thing,

492
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,800
you go home, you came,you relax you know but,

493
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,867
I'm kind of anaffectionate kinda guy,

494
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:15,100
and so I kinda miss thatpart of it and that's why

495
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,600
I still like havinga relationship,

496
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,000
when it happens, you know.

497
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:22,000
And uh, you know for exampleeh, Tera Patrick man,

498
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,567
not only wasshe incredible in bed

499
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:26,233
but there was just,I just liked her.

500
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,933
And, that that, sense ofhumor and the craziness,

501
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,933
a little bitdifferent, you know.

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,767
So, I hadn't dated anybodyin so long when I met her

503
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,267
I forgot howto do it, and uh,

504
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,333
I did ask her outto dinner twice,

505
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
and we went out to dinnerand we had a good time

506
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,133
but I dropped her off at herplace without asking her

507
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,900
if I could, come in.

508
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:50,300
And I don't knoweh, I might have,

509
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:51,800
she mightathought I was weird.

510
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:55,133
I already had sex with her acouple of times, on camera,

511
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,267
and she mighta thoughtit was weird that

512
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,400
I didn't wanna come upand finish the date,

513
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:00,700
but I was kinda showing herthat I wasn't just there

514
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:05,100
for the sex, and, maybeit wasn't a good move

515
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,833
cause you leave abeautiful woman like that

516
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,467
alone for too long and somebodyelse is gonna come along

517
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,067
and somebody elsedid come along and,

518
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:11,300
that was that.

519
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,933
She made it today,this is Tera Patrick.

520
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,933
Hello.

521
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,467
And uh, Tera is reasonablyknown in the business

522
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:20,000
and hasn't evenworked that often.

523
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:20,967
Apparently.

524
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Um.

525
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:26,233
I was just trying topace myself right now.

526
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,233
One of my alltime favorites.

527
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:36,967
Most of the people who seekit out don't have means

528
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:41,400
of making that kind ofmoney by other means.

529
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:44,133
I mean very fewwomen say hmm,

530
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,133
I'm going to become asurgeon or I'm going

531
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,167
to becomea pornography star.

532
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,867
This country doesnot raise people

533
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:51,933
with a very good work ethic.

534
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,333
They don't know howto do anything else.

535
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,967
They don't knowhow to do retail,

536
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:58,867
they don't know how todo Excel spreadsheets.

537
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:01,767
Many people who make theirway to adult entertainment,

538
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,567
like rock-and-roll, are notsuited for nine-to-fivework.

539
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,900
I, ran away fromhome at sixteen

540
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,900
and was living on thestreets at seventeen.

541
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:14,067
Uh, everything I ownedwas in two garbage bags.

542
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:18,867
Um, my parents were saying Ihope you just kill yourself

543
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:20,933
and make life a loteasier for the rest of us.

544
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,833
Uh, it was just on and onand on so there I was

545
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,167
out on the streets andthen, when I got taken in

546
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:29,433
with a foster family,um, I made sure that

547
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,300
I kept finishing schoolwith good grades

548
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:32,800
because that was gonnabe my future that

549
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,167
was gonna be my ticketoutta there and then

550
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:36,800
when I went to college onfull academic scholarship

551
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,167
I never actuallywent to classes.

552
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,367
I said okay I've gotfree room and board,

553
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:41,400
I need to make money.

554
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,500
I need to get some sort ofsecurity and stability

555
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:47,267
in my life so I don't haveto turn tricks

556
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,933
to get food to eat.

557
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,367
So I took up stripping, I wentto all the local stripbars,

558
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:56,067
and from there I started doingmagazines in New YorkCity.

559
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,167
I would take a trainto New York CIty

560
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,000
on weekendsand do magazines.

561
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:02,800
And then, uh, a photographersaid he knew a director

562
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:04,833
in California named BudLee who could direct me

563
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,267
in some movies if Iwanted to do that.

564
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,767
So um, I packed up mysuitcase and a teddy bear

565
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,533
and went out to LA.

566
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,967
Made a movie for Bud Lee,married him, didn't come back.

567
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:18,467
The reason that Iwanted to do porn,

568
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:22,167
even though I was so smart,Miss MENSA and all that is

569
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:25,433
uh, it's precisely because Iwanted to stop being known

570
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,467
as the nerd the geek the,the one that you come over

571
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:31,033
and you be nice to mejust so you can copy off

572
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,933
of my tests, you know.

573
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,967
(laughing)

574
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:36,033
I would hang out with someof my misfit friends

575
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,867
and they had, theyhad adult magazines

576
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,533
hidden under their bed andthey would look at them

577
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,400
and I would be peekingover their shoulder going

578
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:42,933
I wish someone wouldlook at me like that.

579
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,933
And that was just likemy wildest fantasy that

580
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,267
someone would thinkthat I was pretty

581
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,167
and sexy and, woo!

582
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,833
All my life I'd justbeen the nerd and the geek.

583
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,500
So it was like a fantasycome true for me that

584
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,033
someone wanted to see meon the cover of a magazine.

585
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,433
When I got to porn it waslike wait, I get to pick

586
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,400
which one of these good-lookingguys I wanna sleep with?

587
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,000
And uh, you're gonnapay me for it

588
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:04,100
and then you're gonnaput me on a box cover

589
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:05,100
and give me tons of money?

590
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,100
(laughing)

591
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:08,233
It was just uh, areally big step up

592
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,267
from whereI was coming from.

593
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:13,300
Porn wasn't all that muchof a mental challenge

594
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,933
for me shall we say,um, standing there

595
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,167
and saying my silly linesjust, it didn't take up

596
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:20,367
a whole lot of myday so meanwhile

597
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,433
you got a lot oftime to sit around

598
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,133
and wait so uh, I justkept myself busy

599
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,300
by learning everysingle job on the set.

600
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:29,300
Um, I (laughing)I would get

601
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,167
the grips to take medown to the grip truck

602
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:32,333
and show me the namesof everything on there

603
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,867
and teach me how to doeverything by showing up

604
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,433
with my little grip belt andmy shorts and my gloves

605
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,567
and no shirt on.

606
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:38,700
(laughing)

607
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:40,500
and I would ask very nicelyif they would teach me

608
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,100
their job and they did,and uh,

609
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,533
much the same way Ilearned editing,

610
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,367
directing,producing, scriptwriting,

611
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:49,033
um, every job onthe set I've gotten.

612
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,300
If you look on IMDB my name hasgot all credits next toit

613
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,367
I did everything.

614
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:56,033
I even designedmy own box covers.

615
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,967
Um, what made me different wasI was the first half-asian

616
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:01,167
to become an A-liststar in the business.

617
00:26:01,233 --> 00:26:04,067
Um, before I'd startedthere was the white girls

618
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,333
and the black girlsand the asian girls

619
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,967
and each had theirown separate genre,

620
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:10,267
and, they didn't mix,you, you don't put

621
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,533
an asian girl in awhite girl movie.

622
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,533
(laughing)

623
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,700
It's justthe way it was.

624
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:15,967
And then when I came inand I was only half-asian

625
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,067
the features were soft enoughthat they could still

626
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,367
put me on a cover and I couldstill be a white girl,

627
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:21,500
or and asian girl, theycould play me either way.

628
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,867
Or they could play meas an Indian or a Gypsy,

629
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:24,733
or, Greek girl!

630
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,533
They gave me allthe different roles.

631
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,067
So they just, theywound up using

632
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,567
my lookas very versatile.

633
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:31,967
And so I became thefirst "cross-over" star

634
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:35,467
from a minority, and then uh,I guess they did pretty well

635
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,900
with me cause after I leftVivid they got Koby Tie,

636
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:41,133
who was full asian, so,I kinda opened the door

637
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,333
for the minorities tobecome A-listers.

638
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,233
I, I hated doinglive appearance.

639
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Oh I'm getting sweaty justlooking at this picture.

640
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:48,500
(laughing) Yeah.

641
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,967
I spent like all yearlong dreading the CES Show.

642
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:53,400
I would just have tokeep telling myself

643
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:54,400
they're more scaredthan you are,

644
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:55,467
they're more scaredthan you are.

645
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:57,567
Cause I'd smile and I'd say"So what's your name?"

646
00:26:57,633 --> 00:27:00,867
and they'd go--(laughing)

647
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:03,933
they'd just look at me.Okay what's your name?!

648
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,900
If you see my very firstinterviews from when

649
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:07,067
I was nineteen,twenty years old,

650
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:09,233
I said I'm gonna retirewhen I'm thirty.

651
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,233
And people wouldlaugh and say

652
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,267
oh you've got itall planned out.

653
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,233
There really wasn'tany question about it.

654
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:18,267
I had, gotten married,and, then divorced.

655
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:22,067
And I met someone whohad adult bookstores.

656
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,433
So I basically gotmy introduction

657
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,300
to the adult entertainmentworld through working

658
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:30,467
in adult bookstores,and then consequently

659
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:34,200
owning adult bookstoresand I saw the women

660
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:38,033
that were doing movies atthe time and, I was just,

661
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,633
amazed, because, they hadpimples on their rear-ends,

662
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,200
they had on no makeup,their feet were dirty,

663
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:48,133
their hair was dirty,and I thought my god,

664
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,567
this is not a really goodrepresentation of women.

665
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:52,700
I wanna do that.

666
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:59,133
I mean I had done, um, afew magazines and a few uh,

667
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,067
like, 8 mm loops, andthen I came to California,

668
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:05,300
and I picked up one ofthe free papers and,

669
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:07,000
there was an ad.

670
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:10,300
My family was very, veryokay with what I did

671
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:13,200
because I did tell themwhat I was about to do

672
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:15,667
before I actuallydid anything.

673
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:18,667
I mean I'd done acouple of photo shoots,

674
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:21,333
and decided that I neededto tell my family

675
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,667
before it got out therebecause I didn't want

676
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,200
them finding outfrom someone else.

677
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:29,600
And they're likewell do, you think

678
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,867
you can make money at it?

679
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:33,200
You think you can have a goodcareer and be happy doing this?

680
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:37,433
And I said yes I do, andthey said good, go do it.

681
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,733
We had a very smallcommunity of people,

682
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,233
of players, thatwe all worked with.

683
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,167
And we all worked witheach other quite a bit.

684
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:50,400
So the community wassmall, we were familiar

685
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:53,200
with one another,and, we actu--

686
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:56,100
it's like when you, havea, a new boyfriend

687
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,500
or new girlfriend or anew husband or wife,

688
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:01,167
it takes a little whilebefore you know what

689
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,267
pushes their buttons,what turns them on

690
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:07,233
what makes them feelgood, and then it starts

691
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,733
to become very intimate,and, you can actually,

692
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,167
have an intimaterelationship with the person

693
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,700
you're workingwith on screen,

694
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:19,067
and be fond of themafter the movie is over.

695
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:25,067
Um, but they're justgenerally sweet nice people.

696
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,067
I was beingoffered parts in movies,

697
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:32,167
in, or photo shootsor what have you,

698
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:35,100
and they didn't want to payme the amount of money

699
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:39,567
I wanted, and I said no.I just, I held out.

700
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:44,533
So, um, and subsequentlyI started stripping,

701
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,200
going across the, basicallyacross the world stripping.

702
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:53,467
And uh, doing photo shoots withClub Magazine predominantly.

703
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:55,667
And um, so theydidn't see me in front,

704
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:57,233
people didn't see me infront of the camera

705
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,333
so they thought okay,she's retired.

706
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,167
I've been retired andcome back so many times

707
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,267
I can't keep track anymore.

708
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:06,133
I've also beendead a few times.

709
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:12,067
I saw an add in the paper itsaid "Nude fun, big bucks."

710
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:14,400
and uh, it was an auditionfor an X-rated movie.

711
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:16,533
Two days later I get acall from the producer,

712
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,733
they wanna give me apart in the movie.

713
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,767
I hadn't planned on that.

714
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:25,600
At the time, I had appliedto the Hebrew Union Seminary

715
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:28,633
in Cincinnati, wherethey uh, train people

716
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,200
to become Rabbis.

717
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:33,667
So I'm trying tomeasure, do I wanna do this,

718
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,633
or do I wanna be in a pornmovie because it seems

719
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,600
if I take the part inthe porn movie I maybe,

720
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:42,633
um, cutting some of my optionsoff, for future life.

721
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,833
And the uh, seminary inCincinnati said we'll take you

722
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,133
but the first two years youhave to go to Jerusalem

723
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
and study Aramaic, which,I would rather go

724
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,533
to Cleveland and studytheir sewer system.

725
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Um,no interest there.

726
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:00,533
So I decided I wouldmake the porn movie.

727
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,167
And, in any case the kindof Rabbi I would become,

728
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:06,833
would be the kind thatcould've made a porn movie.

729
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,333
And uh, I wentahead and did the job.

730
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,267
I think I had to becomea sex star just

731
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,267
to come back to normal!

732
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,367
Cause I'd been so humiliatedby being the fat kid!

733
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:20,133
I had the largest breastsin the seventh grade!

734
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,500
The guys wouldmake fun of me

735
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:23,633
and point at meand tease me!

736
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,733
Do you know howdeep those scars go?!

737
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,233
That's ugly shit!

738
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,500
Those are the peoplethat become centerfolds!

739
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:32,200
Cause they gotsomething to prove.

740
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:36,133
I was lucky enough to uh, bein the era when they were

741
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,633
actually trying to makemovies where you needed

742
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,300
to remember lines.

743
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:41,433
And I had the,I was good at that.

744
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,767
So, I got hired formy acting ability,

745
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,400
which being agood actor in porn,

746
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:50,300
is like being the wisest manin the kingdom of the fools.

747
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,633
He promised that Icould fuck you next.

748
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,867
He what?!

749
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:54,700
Gah!

750
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,200
Ow!

751
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:57,200
(screaming)

752
00:31:57,267 --> 00:31:58,700
Let him alone!

753
00:31:58,767 --> 00:31:59,833
I said let him alone!

754
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,633
(shrieking)

755
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,867
Ow!Ah, oh uh!

756
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:04,867
Get the fuckoutta here!

757
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:07,400
My ankle!Ow, my ankle!

758
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:09,633
I was terribleat the sex.

759
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,633
Just rotten!

760
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,233
I was just sotraumatized by it.

761
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,367
But I eventually did learnhow to have sex on camera.

762
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:20,633
I was on the beach in San Diegoand uh, I was by myself.

763
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,567
and I'm sitting there,and I notice there's a,

764
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:26,733
really beautiful woman,laying on a towel and so

765
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
my gaze drifts over to her andher boyfriend looks at me

766
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,300
and sees her--and I look away.

767
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,800
And then eventually I'ddrift back and I'm looking

768
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:36,200
at her again and theboyfriend sees me looking

769
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:37,633
at her againand I'm like shit.

770
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,467
Well the guy gets up,and he starts walkin'

771
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:44,400
over towards me and I'mgoing Oh no! Here we go.

772
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:46,233
You know, this isgonna get ugly.

773
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,733
And he getsclose to me and I,

774
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,567
I'm just clenching myfist ready to defend myself.

775
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:52,733
The guy's a monster,I'm gonna get killed,

776
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,767
I know it, and heleans in and he says

777
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,400
"Were you in Insatiable?"

778
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:59,867
(laughing)And I went YES! YES!

779
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,733
I was so happy that's whatit was, he recognized me

780
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,833
from the movie businessand he wasn't gonna

781
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,167
kick my ass it wasa true delight.

782
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,167
A true delight.

783
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:08,567
We becamefriends at that point.

784
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,300
I hadn't told my parentsthat I was doing this.

785
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,800
I told them I had, wasdoing commercials

786
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:18,233
and low-budget nothing,and, well, that I,

787
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,733
I knew that theyweren't gonna be.

788
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,667
I didn't suspect theywould be very approving

789
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,433
of this kinda stuff.

790
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,367
I made the originalcall prepared

791
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:29,533
to become the blacksheep of the family.

792
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,567
It didn't happen.

793
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:34,467
I'm sure they wereless than thrilled.

794
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:36,333
When my mother would beat the grocery store

795
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,467
the next day and they say

796
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:39,567
"Good to see you,how you doing?

797
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,233
What's going on?"

798
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,600
"Well! My son the doctor's

799
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,267
coming back from Israel,and my other son,

800
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,567
he makes shmacklemovies in California!"

801
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,700
Well I think people mayhave a negative reaction

802
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:57,667
to someone who's a porn starfor a combination of reasons.

803
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:00,967
One is, somebody who seemsto indiscriminately

804
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:03,400
be willing to sleepwith anyone,

805
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:06,400
whether it's onfilm or not, is,

806
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:09,267
no matter what peoplesay, still not somebody

807
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,600
who's particularlyadmired and,

808
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:15,967
again may pose a threatto many relationships.

809
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,967
It is legal work,but it's fucking.

810
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,767
With pictures.

811
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,267
People say "you should,should go into politics"

812
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,233
There's too many pictureswith dicks in my ass,

813
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,333
it's like, it's notgoing to happen.

814
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,800
It happenedby happenstance.

815
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:34,433
I came up with some friendsand I went to a club

816
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,267
called The Rainbow, and, Imet there Althea Flint,

817
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:43,267
the wife of Larry Flint,and a photographer that

818
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,833
she had in tow, and theyapproached me and invited me

819
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,667
to their table, and asked meif I wanted to go to a club

820
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:52,933
and have some drinksand I did.

821
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,767
And she was, doing aninterview for Sting,

822
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:58,767
and we were up there lookingto meet some rockstars,

823
00:34:58,833 --> 00:34:59,967
you know, wewere just girls.

824
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:01,833
Doing our thing.

825
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,333
And she took us in her limo,she had this black limo that

826
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,667
had this Think Pink onthe license plate and this,

827
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,733
I think it was a nakedlady on the side of it.

828
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,000
And I was soimpressed by that.

829
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:14,633
She said what do you doand I said I'm a model

830
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,633
and she said Wow!

831
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,400
I sh-- you know, I, Iown Hustler Magazine

832
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:19,800
and we're gonna putyou in Hustler.

833
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,700
So, that was that!

834
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:26,633
Um, I went into Hustler andum, started doing magazines.

835
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,300
My brother found out and, hehad tried to talk me into it

836
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,600
many times, because everybodyalways said Hey Buck!

837
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,733
Can you get your sisterto do a movie oh my god!

838
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,700
And, um, you know, wenever worked together,

839
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:43,000
on set, but, we alwayschampioned each other's careers.

840
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:47,400
And so my brother said to me,um, I want you to do a movie.

841
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:48,800
And he set it upwith Sin City,

842
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:51,800
it was actually done forSin City and it was called

843
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:53,867
Babewatch, and it was for mybrother's Babewatch series,

844
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:56,567
cause he said if you'regonna do movies for anybody,

845
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:59,633
you have to do, you haveto do one for me, sis,

846
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,333
so I said okay I will.

847
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,500
And the sex wasreal, you know,

848
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:06,700
you'd say, how doyou want the blow-job?

849
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,533
And he'd say, how doyou like the blowjob?

850
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,867
And that would beit, you know and that,

851
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:12,400
we would build offof that.

852
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:14,033
You know, I wasthe kinda person,

853
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,533
it, I lived alife of excess,

854
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,733
and people wouldinvite me to parties,

855
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,367
and they would think Wow!

856
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:24,333
if I offer her someparty tools, then,

857
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm gonna havemy night set up,

858
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,067
I'm gonna wind upgetting laid all night

859
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:28,667
by this beautifulporn star.

860
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:32,033
And then as my addictionwent through another door,

861
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,700
they'd hand me the bagof coke and I'd wind up

862
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,100
in the bathroom allnight, you know,

863
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,967
and you wouldn't be able todrag me out of the bathroom

864
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,900
and I'd be likedon't touch me!

865
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:40,933
and oh!

866
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,067
And all of my lifestarted to kind of spiral.

867
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:49,800
I wound up getting arrested,um, on the highway,

868
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:53,433
and the police knewexactly who I was,

869
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,900
when I got arrested,and, they wanted

870
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,367
to make an example of mewith the court system.

871
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,733
They knew that Iwas, you know,

872
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,100
a big porn star, andum, the gig was up.

873
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:04,967
And I had to face it.

874
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:07,367
And it was the greatestthing that ever happened

875
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,733
to me when I look backon it now because,

876
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,167
it really broughtme into reality.

877
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,600
For the women, they'remuch more damned by society

878
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,500
because no matter howsanctified they are,

879
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:21,067
they're stillconsidered to be whores,

880
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,800
and it's getting worseand worse and worse

881
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:25,633
because a lot of themhave turned to,

882
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,933
what I am vehementlyopposed to,

883
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,733
the escort services, tofurther their career.

884
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,400
In many ways, it has adehumanizing quality,

885
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:39,433
because what you'reresponding to are a set of,

886
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,433
physical cues.

887
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,533
You areresponding to the body,

888
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,100
and you're responding tothe sexual acts per say

889
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:50,500
in a way that isquite animalistic.

890
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:56,700
And, having a more fulldepiction of the person

891
00:37:56,767 --> 00:38:01,667
may even detract from theability to use it purely

892
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:06,100
as masturbatory or otherkind of sexual stimulation.

893
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,167
You can takeevery other category,

894
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,133
every other idea,every other thought.

895
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,600
Basically happiness and successin life all boils down

896
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,000
to what are the quality ofyour bonds with other people.

897
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:18,500
Having anything to do withthe adult industry hacks

898
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:21,500
away those bonds, so you'reisolated, alienated,

899
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,800
um, pushed awayto the margins,

900
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,767
and not treatedas a human being.

901
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:29,167
That's a recipe for disaster,for me and for anyone else.

902
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:33,433
Um, when I was in college acouple of us on the dance team

903
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,700
worked at Hooters so Iwas working at Hooters,

904
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:36,933
I love doing that, a lotof the girls at Hooters

905
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,900
were telling me how I wouldmake a lot of moneystripping

906
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:42,100
and then I had a boyfriendin college who brought me,

907
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:43,933
I went with him and his friendsto a strip club one night

908
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,100
because they always used togo watch amateur night.

909
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,433
He's like Ithink you could win,

910
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,833
I think you could beat thesegirls at amateur night

911
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,800
so I entered and I won, I gotfirst place out of twelvegirls

912
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:55,467
in the amateur contest,and I got $500.

913
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,767
So I was like this is a reallycool job I get to drink,

914
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:59,733
and danceand make money.

915
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,600
This is way better thananything else I can imagine.

916
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,833
When I was twenty-oneI used to watch a lot

917
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,833
of those cinemaX moviesand so I went to uh,

918
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,000
Blockbuster and I gotthe address off the box

919
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:11,833
of a cinemaX movie and Imailed some Polaroids

920
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,033
of myself and a a fewheadshots I had taken,

921
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,033
um, like, and justpictures and I mailed it

922
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,967
and I wrote this letter abouthow I think I'd reallylike

923
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:18,967
to be in the movies.

924
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:20,800
And I heard nothing andthen three months later

925
00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:22,500
I actually got acall from Playboy.

926
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,067
Coming to this industry Ipretty much came into it

927
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:27,267
thinking okay I'm goingto somehow be one

928
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,700
of the most well-knownpornstars of all time.

929
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,267
I wouldn't wanna come intoit and just be another girl

930
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,033
that was aroundfor two years

931
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,533
and then have to go bea hooker. You know.

932
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,167
After I did the Hus-the Playboy thing,

933
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:40,233
um, I shot for Hustler, thenext month I came out to LA,

934
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,733
um, within three weeksafter shooting for Hustler,

935
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,900
um, his wife and hisdau- uh his sister,

936
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,133
or, his daughter, told mehow much they loved me

937
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,900
and they ended up taking me onthe Larry Flint Freedom Tour.

938
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,467
They chose four girlsto go with Larry Flint

939
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,133
to like different Hustlerstores on the freedom tour

940
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
and they chose me andthen Hustler had me,

941
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:58,133
my very first daybeing on the show um,

942
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,733
a Hustler chose me tosign at their booth,

943
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,200
cause they don't havecontract girls they pick girls.

944
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,100
And then a month later therewas a Magic Convention

945
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,200
which is a clothing conventionand Hustler was launching

946
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:08,867
their clothing andHustler had chosen me

947
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:10,933
to be the model of theirclothing and they made,

948
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,200
you know, picturesof me modeling it.

949
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:14,100
So I really didn'tthink about life after porn

950
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,167
because I justcouldn't believe how like,

951
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:17,900
all these thingskept happening.

952
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:19,567
I mean just the things thathappened to me as a new girl

953
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,567
in porn don't happen tomost new girls I mean,

954
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:23,500
I met Larry Flint um,

955
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,867
pretty much my secondmonth in the business.

956
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:27,100
So I didn't thinkabout life after.

957
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,667
I just said--I just always said

958
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:30,200
I'm gonna get marriedand have kids.

959
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:31,900
I used to sayby twenty-seven.

960
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:33,567
Now I say I wanna getmarried by thirty

961
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,067
and have kidsby thirty-two.

962
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,867
When I was marriedI only did girl-girl.

963
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:38,233
I left my husbandand did boy-girl.

964
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,600
Um, when I got back withmy husband at kickass

965
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:44,000
I only did girl-girlagain, we split up,

966
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,133
I did boy-girl, heh!

967
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,767
Then I took like a hiatusfor about six-seven months

968
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,000
and didn't shoot anything.

969
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:50,267
And that's whenI met this guy,

970
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,033
um, who's my, ended upbecoming my fiance,

971
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,233
but we were dating, andI didn't do boy-girl

972
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,133
when I was with him forthe first six months,

973
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
and then he was like, don'tyou think you should go

974
00:40:58,267 --> 00:41:00,900
get a new porn contractbecause that's extra income

975
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:01,900
we can have every month.

976
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,867
And I was like well,you want me to have sex

977
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:04,933
with other guys?

978
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,533
And he was like well, it'sonly six times a year

979
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,100
you're gonna do it, andit's with a condom.

980
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:09,167
I was like okay.

981
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,900
Then of course, like, twodays before the movie

982
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:13,200
my ex was like, I don't want youhaving sex with other guys.

983
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:14,200
Arrrrg! Arr!

984
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:15,533
Let go of me!

985
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,867
Your derrière may be pretty,but that don't mean

986
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:21,033
it's bull-worked from apromiscuous lashing.

987
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,533
SLAP!

988
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,200
Ow!

989
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:25,200
♪

990
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:26,533
Every two-and-a-halfmonths I'd have to shoot

991
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,200
a boy-girl scene and er-usually about two days before

992
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:30,700
he would start beingreally mean to me,

993
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,700
and calling me names, eventhough he was the one

994
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:33,933
who wanted meto do the movies.

995
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,033
Then, on the day when I'dgo to shoot the movie

996
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,033
he'd go out with his friendsand get really drunk,

997
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
then he usually would notkiss me or anything

998
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,833
for two days later, thenwhen my check would come in

999
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,600
he's like that's my check, I letyou have sex with other people.

1000
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,233
And then when I wouldbe asleep sometimes,

1001
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,733
I'd be asleep and I'dhear him watching my movies.

1002
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,000
He'd go and putit in like slow motion

1003
00:41:50,067 --> 00:41:51,100
and make sure theguy wore a condom

1004
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,800
and I wasn'tlying about it.

1005
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:54,833
Um, let's see.

1006
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,600
The most I ever made in amonth was probably when

1007
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,267
I was running for governorbecause my website

1008
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,833
was making aroundtwenty-thousand a month

1009
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,033
and then my online storeselling t-shirts and buttons

1010
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,833
made about ten-fifteenthousand a month,

1011
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,600
and, I felt really badcause I didn't have time

1012
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:07,933
to mail'em all outso I just ended up

1013
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,767
not mailing peopletheir orders.

1014
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:10,800
I feel reallybad about that.

1015
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:13,267
Um, and then my contractwas six thousand a month

1016
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,167
and I was featuredancing, at that time

1017
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,133
feature dancing usedto pay a lot more.

1018
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
That was like, six thousandfor like, three weeks.

1019
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:20,200
I dunno how much that is,

1020
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:22,300
maybe like 50, 60thousand in a month.

1021
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:23,400
That's probably the most.

1022
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:25,300
And then I won a gameshow around that same time.

1023
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:27,233
I won a game show Who Wants tobe Governor of California?

1024
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,633
I won anothertwenty-one thousand.

1025
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,667
Um, that was great.

1026
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:32,267
Um, I guess the most inthe year would probably

1027
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,100
be around 300 thousand.

1028
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,267
I mean I don't think Ithought I was set for life

1029
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,100
I always used to jokewith everyone that um,

1030
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:39,933
I'm either going to, justmake a lot of money

1031
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,933
or I might worst case scenarioI'll marry a rich person.

1032
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,200
That's what I always said.

1033
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:47,367
(nervous chuckling)

1034
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,167
No one comesinto this business

1035
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,733
to wanna be normal onthe back end of it.

1036
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,167
Nobody thinksthat it's gonna end.

1037
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:56,733
You jump on a merry-go-roundyou hope the ride never ends.

1038
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,967
I don't think many of themcan spell the word future.

1039
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:01,100
I don't think they did thisas a short term investment

1040
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:03,933
in their own future,but they burned out.

1041
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,167
Hookers are hookers.

1042
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:08,267
I mean hookers are people whoare looking for a quick buck

1043
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:11,667
with the least amount ofeffort so they turn tricks.

1044
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:14,233
And, uh, being aporn star is just like,

1045
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,333
uh, you know the, theworld's oldest profession

1046
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,833
so, it's, it's notthat complicated,

1047
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,867
uh, reality is hard.

1048
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:27,733
A lot of people blame, blame theindustry for their problems

1049
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,733
but, uh, then they get outin the real world and find,

1050
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,933
lots of problemsin the real world too.

1051
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:40,000
I grew up in Pensilvania, um,in the steel-mill towns.

1052
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:42,167
Worked in thesteel-mills, I drove cabs,

1053
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:45,000
it was sorta typicalthings, uh, people do.

1054
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:48,000
There I did someillustrations for magazines,

1055
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:51,833
in New York and eventually,started playing uh, music.

1056
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,367
Did that for a while.

1057
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:56,200
And then I cameout to California

1058
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,800
and end up gettinginto dirty movies.

1059
00:43:57,867 --> 00:43:59,733
(laughing) Justmet some people.

1060
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,067
Actually I was gonna doa uh, a photo spread,

1061
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:04,933
I was gonna do somephotography of some girls

1062
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,367
who were in the business.

1063
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:08,033
I had an idea I would doa photo shoot of them

1064
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,867
and thena little interview.

1065
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:12,700
And, some people I knew fromillustrating magazines

1066
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,367
in New York said yeah, we'llsee what you come up with,

1067
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:17,100
if it's good we'll pay youand everything so I met the--

1068
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:20,667
these two girls, and,before I knew it, uh,

1069
00:44:20,733 --> 00:44:23,733
I was, in themovies! (laughing)

1070
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,033
So that's sortahow that started.

1071
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,367
But you know when Iwas working it was,

1072
00:44:27,433 --> 00:44:29,800
it wasn't like itis today, it was,

1073
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,267
I'd maybe work forty daysa year and maybe fifteen

1074
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,100
to twenty dayswere sex days.

1075
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:36,200
And today they workevery day of the week.

1076
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:38,100
Maybe twice a day.

1077
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:40,700
You know, viagra shootin' uptheir cocks and stuff like that

1078
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:44,200
I mean it's just they'reruining their sex life

1079
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:46,833
for the rest of theirlives, I'm telling ya!

1080
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,400
I just think there'stoo much going on,

1081
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:51,067
I mean just yourpersonal appetite of it.

1082
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:53,400
I mean, if you'reworking as a performer

1083
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:56,733
and you're working that much Imean, sex loses it'smystery

1084
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,400
in it's sense and it's, I meanI remember being turned on

1085
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:01,767
to a point some times,certain situations

1086
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,467
where I wouldactually shake.

1087
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,733
I mean I'm sure everybody'sbeen in that situation

1088
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,100
and now that, I hateto see that go away.

1089
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:12,033
I remember one time my dadpicked me up from the airport,

1090
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,300
and I was coming in for theholidays and he's, and he-

1091
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,467
I had, my pictures werein Hustler magazine eh,

1092
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:22,200
they were on, about a movieand, and I think I was

1093
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:24,833
(laughing) I was givingsome girl head!

1094
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:30,267
And my father says, "I sawthat picture in Hustler."

1095
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:35,100
I said uh, yeah, picture, that,wasn't so good of a picture.

1096
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,933
And that's all wassaid! (laughing)

1097
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,100
They never wa--It was not something

1098
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:42,367
I wanted to expose themto because it wa--

1099
00:45:42,433 --> 00:45:45,133
you know it it, it'sembarrassing for them.

1100
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,267
We were so proud of what wedid in some of these movies

1101
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:51,000
we did that were-- that were,that got really big play,

1102
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:52,833
that I actually tookher to screenings.

1103
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,300
We had these screeningsin these theaters.

1104
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:57,400
And I'm taking my wifethere watching me have sex

1105
00:45:57,467 --> 00:46:01,133
with these people.And, she was,

1106
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,333
it was difficult for herbut, she appreciated

1107
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,800
the work we were doing, butafter one or two times

1108
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,967
it was like-- or wedid that, I said

1109
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:12,467
hey we don'tdo this no more!

1110
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:14,967
She didn't wanna see anypictures of me or anything.

1111
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:17,067
Although she understoodwhat I was doing and knew

1112
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:21,067
it was the thing that wasnot gonna be, a situation.

1113
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,167
Can I ask you something?

1114
00:46:23,233 --> 00:46:25,400
Those cops, they'rehung pretty good, huh?

1115
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,533
Bet they ain'tgot what I got.

1116
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:34,333
Nobody's gotwhat I got.

1117
00:46:36,033 --> 00:46:39,133
So, yeah, I'd liketo retire and paint.

1118
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,033
If I had a game plan.

1119
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,200
I saved some moneybut I wasn't that good.

1120
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,000
No...

1121
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,867
I didn't make thatmuch money though.

1122
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:46,833
Come on,what'd I make?

1123
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,333
I mean I, didn'twork that much.

1124
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,333
You talking aboutwhen you were acting?

1125
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,500
Save money whenhe was acting?!

1126
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:52,000
He just didn'thave any bills.

1127
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:53,500
I didn't have any bills.See I told you

1128
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:54,900
I didn't haveany bills--

1129
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:57,133
And then he got me!Ha ha--

1130
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,067
Then she showed up!

1131
00:46:58,133 --> 00:46:59,800
I'm a highmaintenance, baby.

1132
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:00,867
Then she showed up...

1133
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:05,133
Even if it's not particularlyglamourous that day,

1134
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,100
you go to work andyou get fussed over,

1135
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:11,767
and if it's a big enoughproduction there's

1136
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:15,400
a makeup artist there, andthere's, and there's attention,

1137
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:18,133
for people who likeattention, um,

1138
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,800
and then they get paid!The very same day!

1139
00:47:21,867 --> 00:47:22,900
Woohoo!

1140
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:25,467
Now, my great friendLee Carol once said

1141
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:28,133
as long as you got a cunt,you'll never starve.

1142
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,200
But, as a danger to that,because, it wears on your mind.

1143
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:36,533
My parents didn't take, reallyan interest in my life

1144
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,533
and I was also sexuallyabused at nine-years-old.

1145
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,933
I had a teenaged boy and hissister who was my classmate

1146
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,233
introduce me tosexuality and uh,

1147
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,433
for the first time in mylife and it horrified me.

1148
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,433
Yeah, as soon as Ibarely graduated high school,

1149
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,867
which, I had tocheat my way through,

1150
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:56,900
my dad ended up comingto me and saying listen,

1151
00:47:56,967 --> 00:47:58,567
you're outta the house, andliterally kicked me out

1152
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:00,267
on the street withno food, no money.

1153
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:03,100
And so I'm literallysitting out on the curb,

1154
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:06,400
on Sherman Way, that bigtough rebellious teenager

1155
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,033
was balling her eyes out.

1156
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,900
And all of a sudden, thisum, beautiful black man

1157
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:15,100
came over to me andsays, are you alright?

1158
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:18,867
What's wrong, why areyou crying sweetheart?

1159
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:20,500
"I have no moneyand I have no food

1160
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,267
and my dad kicked me out."

1161
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:25,533
He put his arm around meand I- I still to this day

1162
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,367
can tell you what thatembrace felt like,

1163
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:31,033
and he just saidbaby I can help you

1164
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:35,200
and I thought Jesus hascome to rescue me.

1165
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:38,467
You know I really thoughthe was gonna help me.

1166
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:41,033
And he said there's a manin the apartment complex

1167
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,233
who would love tomake love to you.

1168
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,233
He lured me in.

1169
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,500
I went--You mean have sex?!

1170
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:48,567
He goes yes, buthe's really gentle,

1171
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:52,000
really nice,and you'll get $35.

1172
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:54,533
So, here I ama single mother,

1173
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,933
I've doneprostitution and stripping,

1174
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,133
now for sixyears I've had, uh,

1175
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,433
I've been at gunpoint, I'vehad stalkers try and kill me,

1176
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,500
cops try and bust me, I meanI've been in the mafia

1177
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:08,900
basically for six years.

1178
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:13,567
So, someone came to me says,girl, why don't you do porn?

1179
00:49:13,633 --> 00:49:15,567
I said porn? What's that?

1180
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:18,900
It was a lot worse thanprostitution, like,

1181
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:20,367
there's a wholecrew around,

1182
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:22,100
they're all strokingthemselves going--

1183
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,300
It was just totally degradingand I went oh my gosh

1184
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:27,600
this is bad,this is really bad.

1185
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:29,300
And then all ofa sudden like,

1186
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:33,200
I can't explain it but allthe rage I ever felt from,

1187
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:37,600
what my parents did, fromchildhood, from like,

1188
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:40,433
all the things that men abusedme with in prostitution

1189
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,133
I just like, let itout, on the screen.

1190
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,267
He just said roll it and it'slike here I am the newbie

1191
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:50,933
but I like, took over theentire scene, it was weird.

1192
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,933
I just went-Rrrraw!

1193
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,233
I'm Roxy! The porn star!Like I was pissed!

1194
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,933
But at the end of the sceneit just ended and I had um,

1195
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,333
bodily fluids on my face,and they just kinda went

1196
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,633
here's a rag and theyjust threw it and me

1197
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,000
and I just grabbedthe rag and went.

1198
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:11,433
And I didn't wantthem to see me cry,

1199
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,967
so I just kinda turnedmy face and I was like,

1200
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:16,433
oh my god, oh my god,oh my god, don't cry,

1201
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,267
Shelley, don't cry,don't cry, don't cry.

1202
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:22,300
Then now all of a sudden I'minvolved doing like anal, um,

1203
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,467
gang-bangs with five orsix different performers

1204
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:25,667
and I'm thinkingoh my god.

1205
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:28,300
Now I'm bringingbig jugs of vodka!

1206
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:30,100
And everyone's eggingyou on telling you

1207
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:33,033
no, girl we love you,we're your family now,

1208
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,067
you're awesome, andthen, and there is

1209
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:36,667
a family atmospherethat they offer.

1210
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,700
Porn star karaoke,everybody hangs out

1211
00:50:38,767 --> 00:50:41,033
at the same parties,wooooo!

1212
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,233
Girl, I love you!

1213
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,067
Everyone's very affectionate,and the reason why

1214
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:47,100
they're so affectionate isbecause that's their family.

1215
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,533
Um, they're out, especiallyin my day, we're outcasts.

1216
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,700
In fact I still havescars from suicide attempts.

1217
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:54,367
And I--

1218
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:56,233
I said I don't care, Idon't wanna live anymore.

1219
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,167
And I took like thirtyprescription pills, and uh,

1220
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:03,500
I didn't die, but I knewI wanted out, bad,

1221
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:05,500
and I remember cryingto God,

1222
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:08,033
drunk off my asson Jack Daniels,

1223
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,600
thinking if you get meoutta this I'll serve you

1224
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,200
with my whole life, I swear togod I'll do whatever you want!

1225
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:14,500
Just get me outta this.

1226
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,700
I mean, people whoare well adjusted

1227
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:20,000
and have good life skillsand who are doing something

1228
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:22,400
meaningful and constructivewith their lives,

1229
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:25,067
they're not in theindustry to begin with so,

1230
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:27,167
the people who are in theindustry are really broken

1231
00:51:27,233 --> 00:51:30,533
twisted souls withouta lot of great job skills

1232
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,333
and uh, you know they'returbulent souls.

1233
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,167
So, they'realways gonna be

1234
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:37,133
twisting and turningin the wind.

1235
00:51:37,467 --> 00:51:39,067
We'd spent a lotof time in church.

1236
00:51:39,133 --> 00:51:42,433
I actually convinced my mom tosend me to Christian School

1237
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,733
when I was 14, she found a wayto gather up the funds,

1238
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,033
and I went and I was veryinvolved in my church,

1239
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,800
without her.

1240
00:51:52,867 --> 00:51:54,467
You know,it was just, it was me

1241
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:56,267
and my friendsand that was how

1242
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,367
I grew upand you know,

1243
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:01,033
that all changedwhen I was sixteen.

1244
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,033
(laughing)

1245
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,600
I spent the nightat a girlfriend's house,

1246
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:07,400
and she, was a teenagedmom, and married,

1247
00:52:07,467 --> 00:52:12,000
and her husband,drugged me. With acid.

1248
00:52:12,067 --> 00:52:13,700
And I--At that time I had,

1249
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:15,400
I hadn't even stayedup past ten.

1250
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:18,033
So, uh, I didn't, I wasn'treally well versed

1251
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,367
in the drug world.

1252
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:22,100
And that changedeverything for me.

1253
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,433
I did the best I couldto graduate high school

1254
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,600
as fast as I couldand, and move out.

1255
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:28,433
I was outta thehouse by seventeen.

1256
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,300
I knew some people inthe adult industry

1257
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:32,600
and I hung out with them and I'mstill friends with themnow,

1258
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:34,400
I don't blame themfor hanging out with me

1259
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:36,767
when I was young causethey were young too, so--

1260
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:37,767
(laughing)

1261
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:41,567
Met a few porn stars,and, just--

1262
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:43,333
Fell in lovewith them.

1263
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,167
I hung out with themuntil I was over eighteen,

1264
00:52:47,233 --> 00:52:50,267
did my first movie,and, you know,

1265
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,433
it was onfrom there.

1266
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,800
Well, the first year that Iwas in the adult industry,

1267
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:57,633
and was doing movies Iworked for every company

1268
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,900
under the sun.

1269
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,333
You know the dirtiest of thedirtiest kinds of companies,

1270
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,733
that do crazy stuff.

1271
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,467
I worked for anybody, Icould, to make a buck.

1272
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:11,767
I told my momand she flipped out.

1273
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:15,333
She wasn't happy aboutit but eventually when I,

1274
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,800
you know, formed a career,and I signed with Vivid,

1275
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:19,733
and the pictureswere prettier,

1276
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:25,567
and the footage was lessdisgusting, ha ha ha ha!

1277
00:53:25,633 --> 00:53:29,367
Um, she came to terms and youknow, what's she gonna do?

1278
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:30,633
It is what it is.

1279
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,200
Being a Vividgirl is, you know,

1280
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:38,833
it's what every adult industryactress wants to be.

1281
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,733
You know Vivid'sthe biggest best

1282
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,633
and most well-knowncompany in the world.

1283
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,700
They have the mostbeautiful girls,

1284
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,167
they have thebest photographers.

1285
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:50,233
Um, they havethe best press.

1286
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,333
And, (deep breath),it's yeah, it's,

1287
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,533
it's a high classslew of girls.

1288
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,667
I would think-- I mean,of course you know,

1289
00:53:57,733 --> 00:53:58,733
it's as high classas it's gonna get.

1290
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,567
(laughing)

1291
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:04,167
Um, it's a steady income,so I don't know if

1292
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:06,867
I necessarily thought I wasbetter than anybody else,

1293
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:10,100
but I knew I was gettingthe press that I wanted,

1294
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:13,667
so, I was happy.You know.

1295
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,333
I took my moviesvery seriously.

1296
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,867
I studied my scripts.

1297
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:20,600
Half the timeI wasn't stoned,

1298
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:23,233
when I did the dialogue,but I took my acting

1299
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,133
very seriously becauseit was the only time

1300
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,600
I was ever gonna getto do any acting.

1301
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:30,800
So, I took it seriously!And I loved it!

1302
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:35,733
And um, I thought I wasgood at it but, you know--

1303
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,433
It just sounds socliche for me to say

1304
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,500
I took the acting in myporno movie seriously.

1305
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:42,667
But, but I did.

1306
00:54:42,733 --> 00:54:46,400
And that was my favoritepart, was the acting.

1307
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:49,733
And sometimesthe sex.

1308
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,633
(laughing)

1309
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,733
You can use drugs andparty and drink,

1310
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,300
no matter what careerchoice you have, but,

1311
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:02,267
(deep breath), yes,you're opened up

1312
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,700
to the party lifestylea lot more.

1313
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:06,367
I mean, you hang outwith rockstars, you,

1314
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:10,600
you know there's alwaysporn parties to go to, um--

1315
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,367
Me, struggling as an addict,of course took advantage

1316
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:18,900
of everything thatwas there, you know,

1317
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,900
all of the alcohol,all of--

1318
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:23,200
all of the drugs,I did 'em all!

1319
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:24,933
(laughing)

1320
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,333
Um--

1321
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,167
It's not a safe businessto be in

1322
00:55:29,233 --> 00:55:30,500
if you wannastay clean.

1323
00:55:31,933 --> 00:55:33,233
It's not safe.

1324
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,233
Um, and I'm nottelling you this

1325
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,700
to make you feel sorryfor me or anything

1326
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,533
but I had an extremelytough childhood,

1327
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,733
and um, I think I got verylost for many years.

1328
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,200
Um, I didn't know who Iwas, like many people.

1329
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:52,433
Um, I had a very warpedunderstanding of what love was.

1330
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,333
And um, I think because of alack of love in my life ora,

1331
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,367
an inability to determinewhat love really is

1332
00:56:00,433 --> 00:56:04,500
I saw sexualattention, as love.

1333
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:06,733
And when you've suffered a lotof sexual abuse in yourlife

1334
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,500
it's understandable I thinkwhy you would feel that way.

1335
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,567
Trying to tell you...

1336
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:14,533
at what pointI made the decision

1337
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,433
to be Tiffany Million is notsomething I could answer

1338
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,800
really in justone neat sentence.

1339
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:21,867
It's kind of acombination of things.

1340
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,633
Essentially the whole reasonthat I even got into

1341
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,433
that business to beginwith was because I was

1342
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,900
a single mother, likemany people, and um,

1343
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:37,333
I was living in SouthernCalifornia, I had no family,

1344
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,933
I didn't knowthat many people,

1345
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,600
her father wasn'thelping me with her,

1346
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:43,533
and it was pretty scary beinga single parent honestly,

1347
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,767
and so, I mean Ifigured, you know

1348
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,767
I had a choice: I couldwork eight hours a day,

1349
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:51,767
and commute an hour or twoeach way on the freeway,

1350
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:54,367
to make, seveneight dollars an hour,

1351
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:56,933
only to pay outhalf of that in taxes,

1352
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,767
and child care, and mydaughter's with you know

1353
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,767
heaven knows whoduring the day,

1354
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:05,233
or I could re-enter theadult entertainment industry

1355
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,400
'cause I'd been astripper years before.

1356
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,567
And then I thought, causeI'd always been kind of a fan

1357
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:12,233
of adult films, and I'd somany times I had looked

1358
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,833
at those movies anduh, I'd thought man,

1359
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,567
you know what I could do thatand I could do it better.

1360
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:19,967
You know. And so I thoughtwell heck, why not?

1361
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:21,767
I mean I didn't have aman in my life anymore,

1362
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:25,267
I left her father, and uh, Idefinitely needed the money,

1363
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:27,833
but really it justafforded me a way to,

1364
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,967
work as little as possible toget as much money as I could

1365
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:32,633
to be with my daughtercause that's all

1366
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,967
I really wanted I wanted mydaughter to have a greatlife,

1367
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:37,867
and a safe home, in agood neighborhood,

1368
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:39,467
with good childcare,and I wanted

1369
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:40,967
to spend as much timewith her as I could.

1370
00:57:41,033 --> 00:57:43,767
And working in the adultfilm industry allowed me

1371
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:47,267
to work a day or two a weekand be with my daughter

1372
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:48,700
the rest of the weekand make more money

1373
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:50,033
than people thanworked, you know,

1374
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,300
five days a week,eight hours a day.

1375
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:54,533
What you do in pornfilms is not sex.

1376
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,967
I mean I knowyou're being penetrated,

1377
00:57:56,033 --> 00:57:57,467
but it's like this,you know.

1378
00:57:57,533 --> 00:57:58,467
It's like this.

1379
00:57:58,533 --> 00:57:59,667
I mean that'swhat it feels like.

1380
00:57:59,733 --> 00:58:03,700
It's just something occupyingum, a chasm in your body.

1381
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:05,833
Really--It's like this.

1382
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,967
It's like this that'swhat it might as well be.

1383
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:09,533
Uh, there uh,there's no emotion there,

1384
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,667
there's nofeeling, um, you know,

1385
00:58:11,733 --> 00:58:15,033
you know, I gotta tell youthis funny little story!

1386
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,700
I would have so manyfans come up to me

1387
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:18,500
at autograph signingswhatever and tell me that

1388
00:58:18,567 --> 00:58:20,333
I was their favoriteporn star,

1389
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,000
because all the othergirls were faking it

1390
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:23,600
and I was the onethat they knew,

1391
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,367
man, that I was forreal. (laughing)

1392
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:28,500
And uh, and I can tellwhen a woman's faking it

1393
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:30,067
and I'd be laughing!

1394
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:33,400
Watch my face.Watch my face.

1395
00:58:35,933 --> 00:58:38,100
(screaming)

1396
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,800
'Cause I'd be like--

1397
00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:41,533
I'm the biggest damnfaker you ever met!

1398
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,333
I mean I'm good, that's whyI get paid the big bucks.

1399
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,967
Even when I wasin the business,

1400
00:58:46,033 --> 00:58:49,833
I didn't partake of all ofthe extraneous activities.

1401
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,667
Um, I think I went toseveral parties only

1402
00:58:51,733 --> 00:58:53,033
because there was freefood and boozes,

1403
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,733
and I would go and Iwould eat and stuff

1404
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,067
and then everybody wouldgo to the after-parties

1405
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:58,533
and I'd be like nah, I'mgoing home and going to bed.

1406
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,533
(laughing)

1407
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,867
I've always been earlyto bed, early to rise.

1408
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:03,567
I never wanted to be apart of that scene and um,

1409
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:04,900
even when I wasworking in the movies

1410
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:06,900
I always kinda felt likea fly on the wall.

1411
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:08,833
Like I know mybody was involved,

1412
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,500
because,obviously, I was there.

1413
00:59:10,567 --> 00:59:12,600
But I always had thisstrange feeling

1414
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:13,900
this real feelingof disconnect.

1415
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,767
Like I was uphere looking down.

1416
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:18,467
When my father died in94, uh like I said

1417
00:59:18,533 --> 00:59:19,967
he left me a wholebunch of money,

1418
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:22,033
and I suddenly realizedthat I'm free.

1419
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,900
I don't have tobe her anymore.

1420
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:26,000
And I walked away.And that was it.

1421
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,067
No one puts a gun toanybody's head to do this.

1422
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:31,400
If you're not warnedabout what's gonna happen

1423
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,000
then the person who didn'twarn you is the person who's

1424
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:35,500
guilty in that respect,but they're doing it

1425
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:37,733
for the one thing thatthey cannot deny.

1426
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,733
That absolute death-wish,for the recognition,

1427
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,500
validation, andcredibility.

1428
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:44,667
And they're welcome toit, but eventually

1429
00:59:44,733 --> 00:59:47,733
their past will catch upto them and they have

1430
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,867
to be aware of the factthat X is forever.

1431
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:56,367
When I got into the business,um, I, did have a goal.

1432
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:58,933
It was my "crackedout" goal. (laughing)

1433
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,100
But I did have agoal to, be out,

1434
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:06,900
and retired, twenty-six, atthe latest twenty-seven.

1435
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:08,467
Um--

1436
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,567
And I was out,by twenty-four.

1437
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:17,967
I didn't leave the businessbecause uh, I wanted to.

1438
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:20,167
I left the businesscause I felt I HAD to.

1439
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:22,500
That it was theright thing to do.

1440
01:00:22,567 --> 01:00:28,433
On November fourth, 1984,was the first headline,

1441
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,600
in the SanFrancisco Chronicle,

1442
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:34,000
regarding the heterosexualtransmission of AIDS.

1443
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:37,033
A good friend of mine,who was a mathematician

1444
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,433
had read the same articleI did and he came over

1445
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,167
to my house in theafternoon and he said

1446
01:00:41,233 --> 01:00:44,600
"I've done some calculationsbased on the numbers,

1447
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:45,967
reported here in the story.

1448
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:48,533
And you're in the wrongplace at the wrong time.

1449
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,667
I want you to stop."

1450
01:00:50,733 --> 01:00:52,467
I had three jobslined up for December,

1451
01:00:52,533 --> 01:00:55,100
my wife said I don'twant you to do them.

1452
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,733
And my thinking was look,they're just trying

1453
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,800
to sell newspapers, that'swhat newspapers do,

1454
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:01,667
they scare you, and so I don'tthink the danger is

1455
01:01:01,733 --> 01:01:04,600
that real, and I'm gonna goahead and do these jobs.

1456
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:06,167
So I went off andI did the three jobs.

1457
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:09,000
And when I came home,and we're about to go

1458
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:11,533
to bed, that night,she said to me

1459
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,933
"Do you think we should?"

1460
01:01:14,533 --> 01:01:16,867
Should? Should what?Have sex?

1461
01:01:16,933 --> 01:01:19,700
"Yeah, do you thinkwe should have sex?"

1462
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:22,433
And I said, what areyou talking about?

1463
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,100
And she said, and Ican quote you verbatim,

1464
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:25,533
I rememberedthis all this time.

1465
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:29,433
She said "Don't youthink it would be prudent,

1466
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,733
if one of us remainedalive, to raise the kids?"

1467
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,133
Pchew!

1468
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:39,967
That was the brick wall.

1469
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:43,933
Somebody had offered mea DVD deal, and I--

1470
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,467
I knew CD-ROMSdidn't do good,

1471
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:46,567
I knew the laserdisks didn't do good,

1472
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:48,067
and I thought,uh, this DVD thing,

1473
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:51,800
whatever it is, won't replacevideo, so I signed it

1474
01:01:51,867 --> 01:01:53,600
without having a lawyerlook at it or anything,

1475
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:58,500
and by the time DVDs startedtaking over from videos,

1476
01:01:58,567 --> 01:02:00,000
I looked at the contractand found out now

1477
01:02:00,067 --> 01:02:04,000
they have my DVD rights,also had internet rights,

1478
01:02:04,067 --> 01:02:06,133
and the companywasn't very good.

1479
01:02:07,567 --> 01:02:09,900
And once I realized I wasn'tgonna make much money

1480
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:12,967
I stayed with EvilAngel my distributor,

1481
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:14,567
for as long as I could,then when they stopped

1482
01:02:14,633 --> 01:02:15,733
doing videos that was it.

1483
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,500
The ones that do well, are outbecause they wanna be out,

1484
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:20,200
not because theyhad to get out.

1485
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:24,000
And, they have madetheir peace with what they did,

1486
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:26,200
and that showsin their bearing,

1487
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:28,567
and the way thatthey are, in the world.

1488
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:31,600
The money that I didsave up went really quick.

1489
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:35,667
Um, and then I wasjust, scraping by.

1490
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:41,000
And it was, um, it was theChristian community that

1491
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:43,600
really came alongsideme and helped me out.

1492
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:44,833
There would betimes when I was,

1493
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,867
didn't know how Iwas gonna pay my rent,

1494
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:50,867
and, somebody, it was justpeople I don't even know,

1495
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:54,100
just people who've read mystory, who wanted to help.

1496
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,667
When I left the businessI sold my house

1497
01:02:56,733 --> 01:03:02,733
in Los Angeles, um, I first-I retired, and then,

1498
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,033
um, I decided, I needto get out of L.A.

1499
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,733
I neededto get out of L.A.

1500
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,633
I mean, everywhere Iwent, McDonalds drive-thru,

1501
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:18,100
um, nightclubs, the movietheatre, the park,

1502
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:21,567
Universal Studios,I mean, you name it,

1503
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:24,067
I could not, go anywhere.I mean I don't know

1504
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,067
how these big celebritiesdeal with it all.

1505
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:27,067
I mean they must ha--

1506
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:28,200
They have to havebodyguards of course

1507
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:31,700
and stuff like that causeI did not have bodyguards

1508
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:33,867
and I could nothandle it.

1509
01:03:33,933 --> 01:03:36,767
It's impossible to lead a normallife after you get out of it.

1510
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:39,133
This is forever. Thisis the scarlet letter.

1511
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,533
And it, it never goes away,you'll be dealing with the,

1512
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,633
with the implicationsof this forever.

1513
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,233
What, (sigh),

1514
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,200
what tends to happen isthat it isolates you.

1515
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:54,733
And so you,develop a, a fear of,

1516
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,900
being rejected againand again and again

1517
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:59,633
and so you put up wallsbetween you and other people,

1518
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:02,933
and you isolate yourself andyou don't join communities,

1519
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,800
and, when you're isolatedyou're less likely

1520
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:06,933
to suffer rejection.

1521
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,133
But you're also isolatedand living on the edge

1522
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,267
so, um, you can neverget away from this,

1523
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:14,133
there's no solution.

1524
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,933
To go from beinguh, a movie star,

1525
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,667
to zippothe pinhead overnight,

1526
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:24,633
was just like,devastating to my ego.

1527
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:28,067
If you're looking for a longcareer in the porn business

1528
01:04:28,133 --> 01:04:31,133
you're probablylooking in the wrong place.

1529
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,567
Uh, the average girl, mightbe good for, two years?

1530
01:04:36,633 --> 01:04:40,867
Two to three years topsfor the average girl.

1531
01:04:40,933 --> 01:04:43,933
If you're lucky and you'reone of the few superstars,

1532
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,767
not very many of those,okay then you get uh,

1533
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:47,767
you know, six sevenyears. Eight years.

1534
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:50,100
And if you playyour cards right,

1535
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:52,967
and do your financial thingright, then you can,

1536
01:04:53,033 --> 01:04:55,800
you know, make some moneyand set yourself up.

1537
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,400
Overall I guessI'm happy I did it.

1538
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:00,767
I mean the only thing Idon't like is that, it,

1539
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,800
the main thing I reallywanted to do is act and be

1540
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:06,233
in comedies and tv, and Ifeel like it holds me back.

1541
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,067
But I don't know if Iwould have just stuck

1542
01:05:08,133 --> 01:05:09,733
with the normal routeif I would've uh,

1543
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,000
ended up makingit to tv at all,

1544
01:05:11,067 --> 01:05:12,900
who knows I'd probably,maybe still be

1545
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:14,433
in Florida goingto castings,

1546
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,233
maybe I never wouldhave come out here.

1547
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,067
So, and I've gotten to doa lot of Cinemax movies

1548
01:05:18,133 --> 01:05:20,133
which are really fun too,and all those things

1549
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,767
I've gotten to do becauseof probably the porn.

1550
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,767
So overall I guessI'm happy I did it.

1551
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,900
Um, uh, part of the reasonwe're her in Utah is

1552
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:28,933
because porn isillegal here, so uh,

1553
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,067
it really helps keep mefrom being recognized.

1554
01:05:31,133 --> 01:05:33,333
That and the fortyextra pounds I gained!

1555
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,933
But um, now that I'mlosing that weight, um,

1556
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,867
well I also cut off myhair so that helps too.

1557
01:05:38,933 --> 01:05:40,200
But um.

1558
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:41,767
Yeah, everyone'sbeen really cool about,

1559
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,933
um, if theyfind out who I am.

1560
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,267
They've beenreally good about it.

1561
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:47,000
When I took Kattyto her new daycare

1562
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:50,333
and they asked, if I had um,reference names for like,

1563
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,933
who to call if somethinghappens to Katty I said

1564
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,833
I don't know anybody here, Ihave no references, sorry,

1565
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,833
and she thought that wasa little bit suspicious,

1566
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,300
and so shelooked me up online,

1567
01:05:57,367 --> 01:06:01,367
I had given her thename Asia Lemon, um,

1568
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:03,100
and from that name shemanaged to figure out

1569
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,467
who I was and so thenext day she goes,

1570
01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:06,833
uh, you know I did alittle Googling on you.

1571
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,133
And I was like Ugh!(nervous laughing)

1572
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,233
Miss Mormon Mommy of four whodid a little Googling on Asia.

1573
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,533
I was like, so, youstill gonna watch my kid?

1574
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,467
Well you know,unfortunately like uh,

1575
01:06:19,533 --> 01:06:22,167
one of the reasons I like--the fact that Vince Neal

1576
01:06:22,233 --> 01:06:24,267
has me playing his charitytournament for his daughter

1577
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,933
for children'scancer and stuff,

1578
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,767
and I played inthe Country uh,

1579
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,033
Academy of Country MusicAwards charity tournament

1580
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,767
this year and a few othercharity tournaments

1581
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:36,167
cause it's one of the only ways,that porn people can give

1582
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:40,333
to charities, unfortunatelyin this hypocritical world,

1583
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,800
a lot of charities don'twant to accept money

1584
01:06:42,867 --> 01:06:44,167
from people that arein the sex business.

1585
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:47,100
"Eww, the sexbusiness we can't do that."

1586
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,933
Politicians,on the other hand,

1587
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
who make us lookclean as hell,

1588
01:06:51,067 --> 01:06:52,233
no problemtaking their money.

1589
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,900
Uh, unscrupulousbusiness men

1590
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:56,367
who's ripping everybodyoff, no problem!

1591
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,833
But because we have alittle sex once in a while,

1592
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,233
naw, can't do you andthat pissed me off.

1593
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,300
I had one interestingmoment in baseball

1594
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:05,300
with my son in little league.

1595
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:07,467
I had told nobodyabout my career,

1596
01:07:07,533 --> 01:07:12,033
and uh, one day the manager,who was this big black guy

1597
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,033
who was a Stanford graduate,he comes up to me

1598
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:19,000
and he goes, "Gonna besome trouble today."

1599
01:07:19,067 --> 01:07:20,100
And I said what do you mean?

1600
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:22,800
He says, "One of the mothersknows who's you are."

1601
01:07:22,867 --> 01:07:25,467
He looks at me and he'ssays "You know I knew

1602
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:27,467
who you were the minuteyou came on the field."

1603
01:07:27,533 --> 01:07:28,467
And he said I'lltell you the truth.

1604
01:07:28,533 --> 01:07:30,133
He said "Anybody that's been

1605
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,467
in Nina Hartly's bootyis okay with me."

1606
01:07:32,533 --> 01:07:35,333
(laughing) He says

1607
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,567
"I will take care of this."And he did.

1608
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:39,333
MENSA'sa high IQ society.

1609
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,467
You have to have an IQ in thetop two percent, to get in.

1610
01:07:43,533 --> 01:07:47,000
I got in, with a notarizedcopy of my SAT scores.

1611
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:49,100
MENSA didn't want link tomy website even though

1612
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:51,067
they linked all themember's websites,

1613
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:53,067
because uh, of who Iwas, and adult star,

1614
01:07:53,133 --> 01:07:56,100
um, so, thatwas their excuse,

1615
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:59,233
and so I made them a speciallittle webpage of Asia

1616
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,133
just like, happy Asia, collegepictures and smiling Asia

1617
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,533
and, just innocentstuff and it's two pages,

1618
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,367
and that's, so that'swhere MENSA links to now,

1619
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:09,033
instead of my regular site.

1620
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,433
And they finallyacknowledged me

1621
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,367
in their MENSA celebrityissue which was,

1622
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:15,933
a really big moment for me.That was cool.

1623
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:18,233
Wait,how do you say it?

1624
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:18,933
(inaudible)Unprecedented?

1625
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,033
Unprecedented?It sounds weird.

1626
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,000
Okay. (laughing)

1627
01:08:21,067 --> 01:08:24,467
I've done somethingunprecedented that

1628
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,900
nobody else in, the adultindustry has ever done.

1629
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:28,400
Um, and that wasyou know running

1630
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:31,233
for Governor of California,actually two times.

1631
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,300
And um, it was amazing,when I first started out,

1632
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:36,533
the owner of my companyand I thought that

1633
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,033
it was gonna be justlike a little fun joke,

1634
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,133
see if I couldget some press,

1635
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,167
maybe get on the van.com,so when I went down

1636
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:42,933
to the courthouse to getmy paperwork when we said

1637
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,200
I was gonna do it, um,Howard Stern Show

1638
01:08:45,267 --> 01:08:48,200
sent a camera crew down,Channel 7, Channel 5,

1639
01:08:48,267 --> 01:08:49,367
all the newsshows showed up,

1640
01:08:49,433 --> 01:08:51,600
Associated Press, writers,and that's when him

1641
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:53,567
and I are like Okay,I gotta get on that ballot

1642
01:08:53,633 --> 01:08:55,133
because this isgonna be huge.

1643
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,900
I'm going to get ridof the car tax and

1644
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:58,933
put a tax on breastimplants instead.

1645
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,433
I will legalizegay marriage.

1646
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,567
And I will make sureeveryone who files

1647
01:09:02,633 --> 01:09:04,433
for unemploymentgets jury duty.

1648
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,400
In other words, California,I'll be a kickass governor,

1649
01:09:07,467 --> 01:09:10,233
so vote for me, MaryCarey, on October 7th.

1650
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,333
I mean, of course, someof my platforms were very

1651
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,967
tongue in cheek, andfunny but, you know,

1652
01:09:16,033 --> 01:09:17,633
when I was gettingtowards the end of it

1653
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,400
I realized that youknow I really wanted

1654
01:09:19,467 --> 01:09:21,533
to make a difference andI felt like I really was

1655
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,867
making a difference becauseI was getting a lot

1656
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:25,567
of people who normallywouldn't follow politics

1657
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:29,133
to follow, because of me.And um, you know,

1658
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,267
and then I was likewhat if I win?

1659
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,567
(laughing) But, you know,

1660
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:33,400
coming in tenth placeis pretty amazing

1661
01:09:33,467 --> 01:09:34,933
out of a hundred andthirty-two people.

1662
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,067
When I was eighteenyears old, um,

1663
01:09:37,133 --> 01:09:39,467
I went to uh, real-estateschool, just everything

1664
01:09:39,533 --> 01:09:41,433
about real-estatejust I really liked,

1665
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,300
so I figured that I wouldalways, do something withthat.

1666
01:09:45,367 --> 01:09:47,933
I was working fora builder, uh, a,

1667
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
a home builder, here,and, corporate,

1668
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:56,300
came to my communityand shut the doors

1669
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:57,467
and said we needto talk to you.

1670
01:09:57,533 --> 01:10:02,100
Someone recognized you,We know who you are,

1671
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:05,300
and you are toorecognizable and it's a,

1672
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,933
we're tooconservative of a company,

1673
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
and we're gonnahave to let you go.

1674
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,933
And so that wasright before,

1675
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
that was a week before Igot diagnosed with cancer.

1676
01:10:16,067 --> 01:10:17,900
And the ones that gotout of this business

1677
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:21,167
and now are being blightedby the society that

1678
01:10:21,233 --> 01:10:22,467
jacked off to them.

1679
01:10:22,533 --> 01:10:25,167
Well the society are theones that's guilty for that.

1680
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:26,500
They're damning themfor something that

1681
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:28,167
gave them pleasure,but they refuse

1682
01:10:28,233 --> 01:10:29,933
to admit that they gotthe pleasure from them.

1683
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,433
and that's a very verysad state of affairs.

1684
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,633
Now I wasstarting to direct,

1685
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:39,200
and I was hired, uh,a couple months later,

1686
01:10:39,267 --> 01:10:40,433
to go to Germany to work.

1687
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,733
I'd make about eight grandor something like that.

1688
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,067
Work eight daysor something.

1689
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:47,667
And I didn't wanna dothis any more at this time,

1690
01:10:47,733 --> 01:10:49,333
I didn't wannado it any more.

1691
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,167
So I left, said goodbyeto her, stood in line

1692
01:10:52,233 --> 01:10:54,667
two hours, and as I'm goingI'm saying I don't wanna go,

1693
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:55,700
I'm saying to myselfI don't wanna go,

1694
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:57,400
I don't wanna go,I don't wanna--

1695
01:10:57,467 --> 01:10:59,200
And it just built upand built up until I got,

1696
01:10:59,267 --> 01:11:02,467
finally got tothe point of where,

1697
01:11:02,533 --> 01:11:03,467
"May I help you?"

1698
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:05,700
they said, youknow, ticket counter,

1699
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:08,433
I said uh, no,I'm not going.

1700
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,567
(laughing) I took mybags, I call up Kathleen

1701
01:11:11,633 --> 01:11:13,067
and I said babyI'm coming home,

1702
01:11:13,133 --> 01:11:15,400
I don't wanna go, I don'twanna go to Europe.

1703
01:11:15,467 --> 01:11:17,167
I'm thinking about thetrip and everything,

1704
01:11:17,233 --> 01:11:20,000
I don't wanna do this, Iwanna stay home with her.

1705
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,333
So, that was prettymuch the last thing I did.

1706
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,500
Really what got meout of it was my husband.

1707
01:11:24,567 --> 01:11:29,333
Because, when I metRon, he had no idea

1708
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,733
who I used to be.Ron loved me, for me.

1709
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,400
And you know he couldhad a much younger woman,

1710
01:11:35,467 --> 01:11:37,233
he could had a muchbetter looking woman,

1711
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,233
he could had a womanwith a lot more money.

1712
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,067
But he fell in lovewith me.

1713
01:11:41,133 --> 01:11:42,700
He didn't know anythingabout that part of me.

1714
01:11:42,767 --> 01:11:45,467
And the fact that heaccepted me for who I was

1715
01:11:45,533 --> 01:11:47,500
and loved mefor who I was--

1716
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:51,633
Taught me howto love me.

1717
01:11:52,367 --> 01:11:53,300
Really.

1718
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:56,633
And his love for mehas reconnected me

1719
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,133
with the person thatI was before I EVER,

1720
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,433
did any of this crap.

1721
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:06,067
All of a sudden Mr. Right cameinto my life, and I hated him.

1722
01:12:06,133 --> 01:12:08,100
Ha! When I first met him.

1723
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:09,733
His whole life he wasraised in Christian school

1724
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,567
from like, he went to thesame school, the same kids

1725
01:12:12,633 --> 01:12:14,333
from like kindergartento like twelfth grade.

1726
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,533
He was like most valuableplayer, he did sports,

1727
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,067
his mom hadall these trophies.

1728
01:12:19,133 --> 01:12:20,200
She hasa book this thick

1729
01:12:20,267 --> 01:12:22,200
just on newspaperclippings on him.

1730
01:12:22,267 --> 01:12:24,533
So I was like jealousalready I hated his guts.

1731
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,200
He would like knock on mydoor and I would answer

1732
01:12:27,267 --> 01:12:28,200
and go,what do you want?

1733
01:12:28,267 --> 01:12:29,533
and he goes "I'm hereto clean your house."

1734
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,000
And I'd be like,what are you doing?

1735
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:33,167
He goes "You're filthy."

1736
01:12:33,233 --> 01:12:34,167
Ha!

1737
01:12:34,233 --> 01:12:36,067
Like, cause I didn'tcook, and I didn't clean

1738
01:12:36,133 --> 01:12:39,100
and I was, and I was,I was falling apart.

1739
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,233
So he literallycleaned my whole house.

1740
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,667
With rags for me, and um,I just stopped working.

1741
01:12:44,733 --> 01:12:46,733
didn't wanna prostituteanymore and lie anymore

1742
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
and we just hit it off andthe next thing you know

1743
01:12:48,867 --> 01:12:51,100
we're snorting meth, andnext thing you know

1744
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:52,233
we're reading thebible together.

1745
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,500
And we're like(sniff) dude!

1746
01:12:54,567 --> 01:12:57,300
Did you see like how likeGod used Joshua like

1747
01:12:57,367 --> 01:12:59,233
to conquer allthose cities dude.

1748
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,467
And he'd be like(sniff) yeah and (inaudible)--

1749
01:13:01,533 --> 01:13:04,133
and like I, I mean we're werejust like so into the Bible!

1750
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,067
And we realized that he hadwent to Christian school

1751
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,567
his whole life and was thepastor's son so he had

1752
01:13:09,633 --> 01:13:13,400
a really great Christianfoundation and,

1753
01:13:13,467 --> 01:13:17,100
I didn't as much as himbut, he was so sweet

1754
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:20,400
and he never once pursuedme sexually, so, um,

1755
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:24,167
we ended up getting marriedon Valentine's Day, 1995.

1756
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:29,267
I met my husband in a pool,in Hollywood, Florida.

1757
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:32,467
At the Diplomat Hotel.And he was married

1758
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:36,233
at the time and I had aboyfriend at the time.

1759
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,633
And, he was in themiddle of splitting up

1760
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,367
and I was kindadone with it.

1761
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:42,367
Little Trist.

1762
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:45,467
And, I told him I wasin the middle of uh,

1763
01:13:45,533 --> 01:13:48,833
putting a webpage together,and, he said oh okay,

1764
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:52,100
and, it had to be maybethree months after

1765
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:56,300
I got my first website up thatI got an email from him.

1766
01:13:56,367 --> 01:13:57,633
We went out once,that was it.

1767
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,567
We haven'tbeen apart since.

1768
01:13:59,633 --> 01:14:01,533
Um, my husband diedin a car accident

1769
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,267
driving homefrom Las Vegas.

1770
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:06,333
I had asked him not to dothis whole gig actually,

1771
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,600
um, I waseight months pregnant

1772
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:09,300
and I didn't want himaway from me that long,

1773
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:11,367
and uh, he's like"I gotta do it honey",

1774
01:14:11,433 --> 01:14:13,300
but he tried, he cutit down to two days

1775
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:15,233
so he was really happy cominghome on the second day

1776
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,700
that he wasall done with this

1777
01:14:16,767 --> 01:14:19,133
and he came racing hometo be with his pregnant wife

1778
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,867
and he flipped the jeep anddidn't ever make it home.

1779
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,133
Suddenly he's goneand now here I am,

1780
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,133
no more income andall these bills to pay

1781
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,200
and it was just like onething on top of another.

1782
01:14:28,267 --> 01:14:31,467
And so I, I just, I putup a plea on my website

1783
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,367
asking, uh, for donations.

1784
01:14:33,433 --> 01:14:35,200
I didn't knowwhat else to do.

1785
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:36,700
No insurance,no money, bills,

1786
01:14:36,767 --> 01:14:41,500
and my fans donated,enormous amounts of money.

1787
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:42,867
Um, the kids werecompletely spoiled,

1788
01:14:42,933 --> 01:14:44,533
they got toys andbooks and presents

1789
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,467
and stuff with pictureson it and just it was,

1790
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:49,200
unbelievable it wouldmake me cry all the time

1791
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:50,500
I would open all the mailfrom all these people

1792
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:52,233
I'd never met and itwas just, it was

1793
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,833
really wonderful havingfans turn out to help me.

1794
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,433
Because you know, I'dbeen online for ten years,

1795
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,700
they'd watched grow upand I'd never asked

1796
01:14:57,767 --> 01:14:59,567
for anything before andhere I was I needed help.

1797
01:14:59,633 --> 01:15:00,700
And they helped me.

1798
01:15:00,767 --> 01:15:04,467
I faced those up and,up and downs many times.

1799
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,767
Certainly with myreal-estate practice

1800
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:09,667
and the market and when themarket dropped in real-estate,

1801
01:15:09,733 --> 01:15:12,167
and now that themarket and, you know,

1802
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:13,600
is dropping all theway across the board

1803
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:15,267
I mean the countryis in crisis.

1804
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:17,167
Our wholecountry is in crisis.

1805
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:20,533
It would be reallyeasy for me right now,

1806
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,633
to want to reinvestigate,you know, porn.

1807
01:15:26,467 --> 01:15:27,533
I definitelywanna have kids.

1808
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,533
That's something like, Iwas actually very depressed

1809
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,900
recently because I,I'm realizing that

1810
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,367
I'm twenty years oldand I'm not married

1811
01:15:33,433 --> 01:15:35,767
and I have no kids. AndI really want kids.

1812
01:15:35,833 --> 01:15:38,633
And, I'd like to have atleast two. Maybe three.

1813
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,567
Because being an onlychild I always wished

1814
01:15:40,633 --> 01:15:41,567
I had a brother or sister.

1815
01:15:41,633 --> 01:15:42,833
I still wish I had abrother or sister.

1816
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,900
Like, you know I just,that's something

1817
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:45,967
I've always wanted so.

1818
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,933
I have a gorgeous family.

1819
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:52,300
My son is amazing.He's my angel.

1820
01:15:55,567 --> 01:15:57,333
My daughter is the best thingthat ever happened to me.

1821
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,567
She saved my life.

1822
01:15:58,633 --> 01:16:00,767
I want my daughter to have acompletely different life.

1823
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:04,267
I want her to, go tocollege is number one.

1824
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:07,300
She's a greatstudent, she's a track star,

1825
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:10,667
she's had to dealwith my porn life.

1826
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:15,467
She, um, hates it.She's embarrassed of it.

1827
01:16:15,533 --> 01:16:18,367
And, um, she won't letme, she doesn't want me

1828
01:16:18,433 --> 01:16:20,233
to go to hertrack meets, sh--

1829
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,767
because she feels someonewould recognize me.

1830
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:27,400
We're going to church now,I go to church and I um,

1831
01:16:27,467 --> 01:16:31,800
have a strong faith, andI have changed my life

1832
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:35,333
and I want for hereverything that--

1833
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,300
I, I don't want her toever have to experience

1834
01:16:37,367 --> 01:16:38,400
what I experienced.

1835
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,767
In the moment?Thank you!

1836
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,400
For being who you are.

1837
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:45,233
Cause you're apretty cool dude.

1838
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,233
(laughing) Oooo!

1839
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,633
Ooo, can I getthat in writing?!

1840
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,733
Sure! I can give itto you in writing!

1841
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,567
Um.

1842
01:16:50,633 --> 01:16:51,800
You're welcome.

1843
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,267
It's interesting.

1844
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,300
I mean, what I'm sittinghere thinking is, I wonder

1845
01:16:56,367 --> 01:16:58,533
how many other people outthere can have this kind

1846
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,800
of conversation withtheir parents.

1847
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:01,367
I mean most people can'tsit around and think

1848
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:04,267
about their parentshaving sex, or, um,

1849
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,333
especially fucking somebodyother than their mother.

1850
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,600
I mean that alonewould I think

1851
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:08,633
irritate a lotof children.

1852
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,900
But, it's very, normalized,in that sex is

1853
01:17:11,967 --> 01:17:13,733
a goody thatshould be enjoyed.

1854
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,433
Um, and when you candifferentiate between sex

1855
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,800
and love and everythingthat happens in between,

1856
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:22,267
um, it's a huge giftthat you can give yourself,

1857
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:25,500
and lovers and partnersand friends and family.

1858
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:29,700
And I'm grateful thatthat's, that's my world.

1859
01:17:30,733 --> 01:17:31,733
Wow.

1860
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,400
I'm impressed.

1861
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:40,467
She, is my role model.She is my hero.

1862
01:17:40,533 --> 01:17:43,833
And, I think Ilearned a lot from my mom.

1863
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,633
She's gone through a lotand I even tell people that

1864
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,000
she's my hero andshe's my role model.

1865
01:17:49,067 --> 01:17:50,700
She's just like whatever,I did it for my daughter

1866
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:53,333
and now she's doing whatshe wants to she owns

1867
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,900
her own business, and nomatter how many people

1868
01:17:55,967 --> 01:17:57,567
talk down about hershe's still does what

1869
01:17:57,633 --> 01:17:59,300
she wants to do andshe's successful at it.

1870
01:17:59,367 --> 01:18:02,967
So, I guess she'sjust a good example of,

1871
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:04,500
don't let otherpeople bring you down,

1872
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:05,700
just keep doingwhat you're doing

1873
01:18:05,767 --> 01:18:07,933
and you'll be successfulin what you wanna do.

1874
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,767
So. I'm very proud of you!Just so you know that!

1875
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:13,267
Please don't start cryingcause then I'll start crying!

1876
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:14,500
I'm not gonna cry!

1877
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,667
I will start crying.

1878
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:19,433
And since my husbanddied there wasn't a lot

1879
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,533
for me to look forward to so itwas kinda nice to have that.

1880
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,033
Mom,your husband died?

1881
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:28,067
(laughing) Daddy.Where's Daddy?

1882
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,500
Where's Daddy?

1883
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:31,700
Up in the clouds.

1884
01:18:31,767 --> 01:18:34,500
There comes a point in our lifewhen family becomes first,

1885
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:37,667
the first thing and thequestion, the answer

1886
01:18:37,733 --> 01:18:41,300
to the question, it justdoesn't even take a beat.

1887
01:18:41,367 --> 01:18:43,600
Sometimes...(unintelligible)

1888
01:18:44,567 --> 01:18:48,300
And we have the opportunity tosee our friends andfamily.

1889
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:51,400
I think Chuck wouldreally appreciate,

1890
01:18:51,467 --> 01:18:53,467
that we're here today.

1891
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:56,667
There was something uniquelyvital about Buck Adams that

1892
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:58,700
could brighten upthe darkest moment,

1893
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:01,767
and put a grin on the faceof the bleakest situation.

1894
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,700
With a body that appeared tobe hewn from a granite block

1895
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:09,667
of cement, and an intensitythat provided his fans

1896
01:19:09,733 --> 01:19:12,600
with a vicarious sustenance,Buck Adams will always be

1897
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:15,500
remembered as the guy whogot it up when it counted.

1898
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:22,867
You know like I said, if youknew it was gonna happen...

1899
01:19:22,933 --> 01:19:24,433
what wouldyou have said?

1900
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,500
And you don'talways get that chance.

1901
01:19:29,867 --> 01:19:31,900
Um, but right now,in my life,

1902
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:35,800
I, regret doing porn.

1903
01:19:35,867 --> 01:19:40,767
I regret doing porn andI never thought, ever,

1904
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:44,633
that I would be,who I became.

1905
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,467
Houston.

1906
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:51,400
I never thought I would beso big and so recognizable

1907
01:19:51,467 --> 01:19:53,667
and just, I justnever thought that

1908
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:56,100
it would turn intowhat it did, for me.

1909
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:58,767
And Godjust says, Shelley,

1910
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:01,033
I'm telling you,you need to--

1911
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,100
you need to trust me,

1912
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:04,433
I've got something betterfor you. I love you.

1913
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,733
I didn't save yourass all these years

1914
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,900
not to give yousomething better.

1915
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:12,500
Well, like,looking back, I didn't,

1916
01:20:12,567 --> 01:20:16,600
honestly I can't really likego, on my computer and,

1917
01:20:16,667 --> 01:20:19,533
and look at stuff thatI used to do anymore

1918
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,567
it just makes me, Ijust, I'm so different.

1919
01:20:22,633 --> 01:20:25,733
I feel so different nowlike, where I am in life.

1920
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,433
It's really hard for me tobelieve that I was that girl.

1921
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,767
So yes, it has changed me.For the better I believe.

1922
01:20:34,033 --> 01:20:36,500
The porn businesshas afforded me

1923
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,600
a very comfortable lifeit has allowed me

1924
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,567
to educate myself in waysthat I probably wouldn't

1925
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:43,800
have been ableto do before.

1926
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:47,400
It's enabled me to travelall over the world and,

1927
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:49,633
meet new andinteresting people.

1928
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:54,233
And it's allowedme to, have the,

1929
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,200
have the cajones,if you will,

1930
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:58,200
to try new andexciting things that

1931
01:20:58,267 --> 01:20:59,867
I probably wouldn'thave done before.

1932
01:20:59,933 --> 01:21:01,767
I would havebeen afraid to do.

1933
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:04,733
I have no fear,to do anything.

1934
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,533
You know because aspeople we have to fully

1935
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,800
and freely accept ourselffor everything we are

1936
01:21:09,867 --> 01:21:11,933
and everything we're notcause if we have compar--

1937
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,733
If we compartmentalize,we're never a whole self.

1938
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,000
You know. Especially inlike relationships,

1939
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:22,367
we don't get tobring our whole self.

1940
01:21:22,433 --> 01:21:24,967
What I am afraid of the mostis because I've lasted

1941
01:21:25,033 --> 01:21:27,500
so long and this industryis now heading towards

1942
01:21:27,567 --> 01:21:30,767
its fourth decade ofpresence on this earth,

1943
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:32,600
that the people whocreated this business,

1944
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:34,900
the Eric Edwardses,the Jamie Guillesses,

1945
01:21:34,967 --> 01:21:37,900
the John Lesleys, the greatpioneers of this business,

1946
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:40,933
are not gonna be withus, forever, and,

1947
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,767
I'd hoped to be around longenough to honor them

1948
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:45,800
but I don't wanna doit fast and furiously

1949
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:48,367
because when they startto fall by the wayside

1950
01:21:48,433 --> 01:21:49,800
somebody's gonna haveto remember them.

1951
01:21:49,867 --> 01:21:52,600
It's based on a line that,"there is no future

1952
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:55,467
if in the present we failto pay homage to the past."

1953
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:58,733
But a lot of them are nowin their fifties andsixties,

1954
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,467
some of them in theirseventies, and somebody is

1955
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:03,933
going to have to be thereto tell their stories.

1956
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,800
Eventually thiswoman is gonna like say,

1957
01:22:06,867 --> 01:22:08,533
wwheeeeuuuheehehehuh.

1958
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,767
And then when you'reeighty-five and you can't

1959
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:14,433
walk no more and you're in awheelchair she's gonna say

1960
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,800
"You remember when youwanted to have sex all day?

1961
01:22:16,867 --> 01:22:18,733
Yeah, what do youmean, you want what?

1962
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,367
Bap!

1963
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:20,500
What do you want?Bap!

1964
01:22:20,567 --> 01:22:22,833
No no no, now I'mgetting back at you."

1965
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,000
(chuckling)

1966
01:22:24,067 --> 01:22:26,667
I miss many thingsabout the business.

1967
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:33,467
But, I guess the clearest wayto say it concisely would be,

1968
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:35,467
the biblical phraseoccurs to me,

1969
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:37,867
"when I was a childI spake as a child,

1970
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:41,033
and when I was a man,I put away childish things."

1971
01:22:41,533 --> 01:22:43,900
I'm trying to thinkof like Joe Nameth.

1972
01:22:43,967 --> 01:22:45,833
Joe, do you missfootball?

1973
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:46,833
Sure he does.

1974
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,400
But he can't playlike he used to play.

1975
01:22:49,467 --> 01:22:52,667
He's, sixty-fiveyears old now.

1976
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:54,000
I'm in the same place.

1977
01:22:54,067 --> 01:22:56,000
Am I happy I did porn?Uh, yeah,

1978
01:22:56,067 --> 01:22:58,633
I really don't have toomany regrets cause I,

1979
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:01,300
it's so much stuff cameout of it that was positive.

1980
01:23:01,367 --> 01:23:04,033
I got to travel aroundthe world, uh,

1981
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,733
I met a lot ofinteresting people,

1982
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,700
I'm way over myquota sexually,

1983
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:10,967
uh, I think uh,people ask me and I,

1984
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:12,867
I guess the estimate's,I've been with like,

1985
01:23:12,933 --> 01:23:14,867
three-thousand womenor something like that,

1986
01:23:14,933 --> 01:23:16,967
most of them wereawesome to work with,

1987
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:21,333
um, still friends witha lot of 'em, so uh,

1988
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,333
yeah, overall it was ahell of an experience.

1989
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,433
Essentially I am livingmy life right now

1990
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,033
the way I wanna live itfor the rest of my life

1991
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,767
and I wanna, I wanna die doingwhat I'm doing right now.

1992
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:32,333
How many peoplecan say that?

1993
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,667
Well I am, that I livehere and I have a place

1994
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:36,700
that I love this muchI think I'm as lucky

1995
01:23:36,767 --> 01:23:38,333
as anybody could beon earth.

1996
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,733
Far as, I mean, I dunnowhat the hell t'ask for.

1997
01:23:41,067 --> 01:23:43,567
I'm happy.

1998
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:45,933
I'm notin a dark place,

1999
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,300
I'm not suicidal,I'm not doing drugs.

2000
01:23:50,367 --> 01:23:52,967
You know I'm notself-destructive.

2001
01:23:53,033 --> 01:23:55,300
Um, but the last twoyears has been a journey,

2002
01:23:55,367 --> 01:23:57,700
cause I was veryself-destructive before and,

2003
01:23:57,767 --> 01:24:00,700
I'm not saying itchanged overnight,

2004
01:24:00,767 --> 01:24:02,733
I still haveself-destructive thoughts,

2005
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:09,600
but, um, I'm just in an,healthier place all around.

2006
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,700
You hear some people wetalk to who are leading

2007
01:24:12,767 --> 01:24:14,467
normal lives, and aredoing pretty good,

2008
01:24:14,533 --> 01:24:15,867
like how the hellwould you really know,

2009
01:24:15,933 --> 01:24:18,533
like, how would you knowwhat really goes on

2010
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,033
in their life at two a.m.?

2011
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,433
The torment, the, you know,how would you know that

2012
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,867
they're gonna tell youabout all the times

2013
01:24:24,933 --> 01:24:26,867
they've been rejected andisolated and,

2014
01:24:26,933 --> 01:24:29,333
and the horror andthe shame that,

2015
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,567
that their childrenconfront and that,

2016
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:34,467
their spouses confront,and the shame that

2017
01:24:34,533 --> 01:24:36,867
they've put theirfamilies through and,

2018
01:24:36,933 --> 01:24:40,367
and the relationships thathave been permanently broken.

2019
01:24:40,433 --> 01:24:42,800
I mean all the, all theburned bridges behind them

2020
01:24:42,867 --> 01:24:44,033
because they'vedone sex work.

2021
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,700
You know most familiesaren't proud

2022
01:24:45,767 --> 01:24:47,500
when their daughtersbecome hookers.

2023
01:24:47,967 --> 01:24:52,667
I think the difference betweenme and the other girls

2024
01:24:52,733 --> 01:24:56,433
in the industry wasthat I've really,

2025
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,867
enjoyed being there andum, not just the sex

2026
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:03,000
I mean I, used it to bettermyself as a person.

2027
01:25:03,067 --> 01:25:05,900
I never let the industry takeadvantage of me in anyway.

2028
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:08,033
I always tookadvantage of the industry.

2029
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,500
I made phenomenal amounts ofmoney I've produced movies,

2030
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:13,167
I wrote movies,I starred in them,

2031
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,533
hell people werepaying me hundreds

2032
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,933
of dollars an hourto sign autographs?

2033
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,767
Woo hoo! I'm up,I'm with this!

2034
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:20,000
Um, I just, I- I ...

2035
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:21,933
The other girls leave witha bad taste in their mouth

2036
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,800
and they- and I just,I have nothing

2037
01:25:24,867 --> 01:25:26,433
but good memorieswhen I look back.

2038
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,500
And right now if I wantedto go back into porn

2039
01:25:28,567 --> 01:25:29,900
I could probably go get acontract almost at any company

2040
01:25:29,967 --> 01:25:31,800
and still just do straightboy-girl scenes.

2041
01:25:31,867 --> 01:25:33,100
And if I really wantedto when I'm thirty-two

2042
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:34,833
if I wanna go back to pornand because I'm really broke

2043
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,933
maybe let's say,hopefully it won't happen,

2044
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,033
I would tell a porncompany guess what,

2045
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,967
I'm gonna come back anddo two guys and do anal.

2046
01:25:41,033 --> 01:25:43,567

2047
01:25:43,633 --> 01:25:46,133
I'll tell 'em I'll do, youknow, a black guy. Heh!

2048
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,100
There isn't thatmuch of a future

2049
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:51,033
after the x-rated industrybecause somehow,

2050
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,033
somewhere, somebodywill find you.

2051
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,867
The famous line I usedto say to anybody

2052
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:57,433
walking into my office whenI ran the biggest agency,

2053
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,700

2054
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:00,500
when your kid bringshome a magazine

2055
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:01,600

2056
01:26:01,667 --> 01:26:02,833

2060
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,700
My husband and myson changed my life.

2061
01:26:13,367 --> 01:26:15,200
And my son saved my life.

2062
