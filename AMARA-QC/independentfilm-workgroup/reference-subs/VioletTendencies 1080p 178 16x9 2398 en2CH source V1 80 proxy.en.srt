1
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,133
Riley.

2
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:27,767
Hedda, that outfit looksamazing.

3
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,233
Well, they loved it at cityhall!

4
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,967
Yes, it's always impressive

5
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:32,700
when a priest wearsknock off Pucci.

6
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,567
What would you expect?Vatican drag?

7
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,400
No, but what'dthe groom think?

8
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,433
Why do you think they'reshipping heroff to Vermont?

9
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,533
Exactly.

10
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,667
Riley!

11
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,067
Hey guys, this ismy other half Riley

12
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,267
We've read all about youon Markus' blog.

13
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,733
Oh, how's the rash?

14
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,733
Yeah! Has it cleared it up yet?

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,500
Markus claims to have writer'sblock

16
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,100
but all he does is blog, blog,blog!

17
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,633
I didn't know you had awriter's block!

18
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,300
That's because he's hasn'tblogged about it.

19
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm just a little stuck on mynew novel.

20
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:00,800
Oh, what's it about?

21
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,633
It's about a gay couplehaving a biological child.

22
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,733
So it's horror?

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,500
If we had kids,could you imagine

24
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,500
what we'd be doing right now?

25
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,067
Carpooling?

26
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,433
You blogged about my rash?

27
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,600
Sorry, honey.

28
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:17,633
Baby.

29
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,133
Hey Zeus.

30
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,600
Do you take change?

31
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,267
You cheap little bitch.

32
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,533
Sodomites, this is about me foronce!

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,500
First I wanna thank manhunt.net

34
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:42,267
for sponsoring my weddingreception.

35
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,033
Welcome!

36
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,867
You know, myrelatives wanted m e

37
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,700
to have a traditional ceremony.

38
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:51,933
Hello?!

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,600
You are my family!

40
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,267
You've been with me through itall:

41
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,967
Fat, thin. A horrible addiction

42
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,967
to very expensive handbags.

43
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,200
But now I've got Michael!

44
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,667
Where's Michael?

45
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,833
Where is my man?

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,567
Give me back my man!

47
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:10,233
Oh there you are!

48
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,167
Many of you are thinking

49
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,900
you're not gonna see me againafter today.

50
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:15,667
That I'm gonna disappear likeall

51
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,067
the fag hags of your youth.

52
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,700
Well, you're right

53
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,500
Finally I found a man who lovesme

54
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,133
and my pussy.

55
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:28,300
I said he loves my pussy!

56
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:29,567
And he's gonna tear it apart

57
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,400
behind that picket fence!

58
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,067
We love you Audrey!

59
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,400
Oh, I love you too

60
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:42,167
You know I lasted as long as Icould

61
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,233
with my boys.

62
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,300
Longer than any fag hag everhas.

63
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:49,833
Well .

64
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,033
Any except Violet.

65
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,600
Toss the bouquet already!

66
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,000
The bouquet is yours Violet, ifI had one.

67
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,533
He's working at the salontonight.

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,900
But you're still together?

69
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,900
Of course. Darian's perfect.

70
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,367
I actually think, I'm fallingin love with

71
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,233
Apparently Dan'scock is so hug e

72
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,733
that the only way to fit it inyour mouth

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,200
is to suck it while itâ€™s soft.

74
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,733
Is that Beer Can Dan?

75
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,267
Yeah.

76
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,200
What about Darian?

77
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,233
Oh, Darian and Luke have anunderstanding.

78
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:33,700
Uh oh, cock-block.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Deflected!

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,267
Luke may have more experience

81
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,900
But his opponent is tenacious

82
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,767
It's battle of the bottoms.

83
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,633
And the biggest loser comes outon top!

84
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,200
Hey beautiful!

85
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:52,367
Hey Zeus, you beast!Look at ya .

86
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,300
Oh, I love it whenyou tease me !

87
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,600
So, I hear you and Luke arejoining forces.

88
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,933
Yes. God I love that guy.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,833
He gave me his whole email listhe's getting sponsors

90
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,100
Oh, your benefit is going to beoff the hook.

91
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,233
New ink?

92
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,433
Yeah, check it out.

93
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,567
Ten years HIV positive, stillkicking.

94
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,133
You don't have to brandyourself.

95
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I just want everyone to know

96
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:13,833
there is life after.

97
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,200
Well, I'll be with you insickness

98
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,167
and in health, count on it.

99
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,233
I love you.

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,333
Paparazzi!

101
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,500
Next Magazine

102
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,733
No more pictures!

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,233
You'll ruin their reputation.

104
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,000
I implore you, no photos!

105
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,833
Really, no more pictures.

106
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,467
I gotta go! See ya'!

107
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,833
Alright, we better go too.

108
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,667
Have a goodnight.

109
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,700
Hey, you too!

110
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,833
Dude!

111
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,467
What's with the skirt?

112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,367
Violet?

113
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,533
Hey, I'm almost done.

114
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm waiting behind the shrub.

115
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:01,567
Ok.

116
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:02,867
She's my roommate.

117
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,600
Yeah, you know man

118
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,633
that's a little weird actually.

119
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,667
Is she watching us?

120
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,767
She's harmless.

121
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:12,733
Fag hags, Jesus!

122
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,133
Hey!

123
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,167
More respect.

124
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,500
She's the last one

125
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,200
Welcome to Frisky Friends

126
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,067

Salome, you sound just like mymother.

129
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:49,033
Mother and I enjoy long countrydrives

130
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,333

Hi Salome, I'm looking for acommitted,

133
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,367
long term relationship with

134
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:58,367
Message deleted. Next message.

135
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,033
It's mailman.

136
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,300
I'm dying to get in a hotsession

137
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:02,800
before we meet.

138
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,200
Mr. Mailman.

139
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,267
It's Salome.

140
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,133
Got a delivery for me?

141
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,500
Another very big package.

142
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,133
What are you wearing?

143
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Just two drops ofChanel Number 5.

144
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,167
Still off today?

145
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,800
You wanna chill?

146
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,133
Let's go to Coney Island

147
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,633
and ride the Cyclone.

148
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,700
Yeah,

149
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,567
let's do that.

150
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,033
So, how was Audrey's reception?

151
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,267
She was so happy.

152
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,433
I wish you could have been

153
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,700
there to see her face.

154
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:05,933
That's the one drawback

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to owning my own business.

156
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,967
Not so much free time.

157
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,567
I have my own business

158
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:12,900
I think there is a little moreleeway

159
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,733
with roving sex parties.

160
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,267
I'm branching out

161
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,100
Can I use your salon for my

162
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,800
â€œLazy Tops and Power Bottomsparty?

163
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,133
My host bailed after the policeraid

164
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,167
you know...

165
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:28,733
What?

166
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,900
You got hickeys again.

167
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,267
Oh, don't!

168
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,100
Who were you with last night?

169
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,500
Clearly an amateur.

170
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,367
Wait, let me get this right.

171
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:40,633
You watched two people

172
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,900
commit to one another,

173
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,767
Hooked up with some random

174
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,367
and then came crawling into bedwith me?

175
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,933
I took a shower first.

176
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,800
Come on D!

177
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,533
I got cock-matized

178
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,433
So, why'd you come over?

179
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Because I wanted to sleep withyou.

180
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,333
But you had sex with somebodyelse.

181
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,067
It's not the same thing. Youknow that.

182
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,167
You are as bad as I am.

183
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,367
Was.

184
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:06,500
We met at a glory hole.

185
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:07,933
I know where we met.

186
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,233
I canâ€™t do this anymore.

187
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:15,800
Wait a second...

188
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,900
You can't do this anymore?

189
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:19,867
Darian, we have anunderstanding.

190
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,733
Well, I asked for a newunderstanding.

191
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,933
If you can't give me that

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,433
I can't do this anymore.

193
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,467
Darian, come on. You know thatI

194
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:29,500
You know I

195
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:36,633
You know the impalas?In Africa?

196
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,833
Did you know they have liketwenty

197
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,700
sexual partners at a go?

198
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:41,000
And what's amazing is that notone impala

199
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:42,533
gets upset or angry

200
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,133
or says they can't do itanymore.

201
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,167
You're right!

202
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm gonna take a shower

203
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,933
When I'm out,

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,467
I wanna find you gone, my keyson the table

205
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,500
and I don't want you coming

206
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,633
around here anymore.

207
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,667
It's over!

208
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:03,700
But I love you.

209
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,733
Hi, do you have a minute forfuture today?

210
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,400
Hi sir

211
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:15,833
do you have a minute for thefuture today?

212
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,967
Sorry, nope. I'm not breeding.

213
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,333
Are you my mailman?

214
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,433
Cute socks!

215
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,433
Salome? That's you.

216
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,567
My gay husband would kill forthese calves!

217
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,000
Please. We're in public.

218
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:31,733
Oh honey its New York-

219
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,067
Everything happens on thestreet.

220
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,067
So, Chinese is okay, right?

221
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,100
I can't do it.

222
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:37,667
I once had the worse gas

223
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,100
after a plate of mu shu pork.

224
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,100
I get it, where should we go?

225
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,567
No, I can't do this.

226
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,233
I'm gonna take a pass.

227
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,200
You're gonna pass?

228
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,267
I know I lied on Frisky Friends

229
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,867
but I came clean

230
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:51,167
I mean, I gave you my realstats.

231
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,600
Salome

232
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,300
I know this sounds clichÃ© but

233
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,767
It's not you

234
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:56,600
It's me.

235
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:57,633
Really.

236
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,267
These were for you.

237
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,733
But I have experience

238
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,033
I have walked the catwalks inParis, Milan,

239
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,633
London!

240
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,767
In nothing but pasties.

241
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,533
Here, see?

242
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,067
My collection is designerclothing.

243
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,600
They were designer pasties.

244
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,733
Bradleigh, please

245
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,233
I need press, help me!

246
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,533
Please.

247
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,500
For the passion we shared

248
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:37,833
when we were boys?

249
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,767
Larice, are you threatening me?

250
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:44,967
Yes

251
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,800
So, you've seen the line sheet.

252
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,167
Bradleigh's new collection wasinspired by

253
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,267
the latest dinosaur discovered

254
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,567
down in Argentina.

255
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,033
Perfect! Let me know when

256
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,900
you want to come for the pull.

257
00:11:58,967 --> 00:11:59,933
Okay.

258
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:04,300
Oh no, not again!

259
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,067
What is wrong with me, Riley?

260
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,333
Why do you keep saying that?

261
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,500
Nothing!

262
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,167
It's not you, it's him.

263
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:15,167
You are surrounded by men wholove you.

264
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,067
Love?

265
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,400
I deserver someone to love meand my pussy

266
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,033
Like Audrey.

267
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,300
Do you hear me?

268
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,467
Um, I hear you.

269
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,133
Donna I would, if I could.

270
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,100
I've got tools.

271
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,133
Not now, Donna.

272
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,533
Still got my hymen.

273
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,567
What you need Violet

274
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,800
is the male version of you.

275
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:37,933
A fag stag.

276
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
A metrosexual?

277
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,633
No, no no no no

278
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,500
A metrosexual will only throwyou off the scent

279
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:43,833
What is it Salome?

280
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,533
I'm going to lunch.

281
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,433
actually not lunch.

282
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,733
I'm being taken out forhigh-end water.

283
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
Can Violet cover reception?

284
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,100
One sec..

285
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,933
A fag stag is special.

286
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
He hangs out with gays becausehe enjoys

287
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:56,800
their energy andtheir attentio n

288
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,600
just like you do.

289
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,633
Does that sort of person reallyexist?

290
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,867
I don't think so.

291
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,300
Can I have a carrot?

292
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:10,600
Nevermind

293
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,133
I probably shouldn't.

294
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,100
My fuck buddy broke up with me.

295
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,400
Oh, no!

296
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:30,167
Really glad I never officiallymoved in

297
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:33,133
because then I'm not officiallykicked out right?

298
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,800
Sweetheart what happened?

299
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:35,900
Suddenly after three monthsDarian

300
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,267
is not a slut anymore.

301
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,033
What does he want? Monogamy?

302
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,167
Sounds like something

303
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,500
I need lasered off.

304
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:43,700
I know.

305
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,200
Oh my gosh, Luke.

306
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:47,367
I think it might be time for us

307
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:49,400
Please, don't say it.

308
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,200
Grow up.

309
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:52,900
I can hear that from anyone butyou.

310
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,467
But, maybe it's time.

311
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,233
I don't see what theproblem is ?

312
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,833
So I play around

313
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,600
what's that got to do withDarian?

314
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,300
But, you know I would give myheart

315
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,167
A lung, and what's left of myliver

316
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,267
to have a chance with a manlike Darian.

317
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,333
That means, you know how luckyyou are

318
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Can I tell you what happened tome?

319
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,933
I met a frisky friend for lunchtoday.

320
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,733
And he can't put up with me fortwo minutes

321
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,867
I mean, leaves me onthe street ,

322
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,500
can you believe it?

323
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:23,033
I'm not even worth a lousylunch.

324
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,867
Which frisky friend?

325
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,733
What's his name and where doeshe live?

326
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,433
Why, what are you going to do?

327
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,733
Beat him up.

328
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,300
Not only a mailman, but aGemini.

329
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:34,567
Have you known me to stoop thatlow?

330
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,400
A Gemini!

331
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:37,800
Yeah, you dodged a bullet onthat one.

332
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,700
And he was probably bi-polar.All Geminis are bi-polar.

333
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:40,733
Hi baby!

334
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,933
Good to see you.

335
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,000
Look at that ass inthose jeans .

336
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,333
Thank you.

337
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,800
I have spammed my whole list.

338
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:50,733
Every last queen is going to be

339
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,067
at that benefit.

340
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,833
What about our queen mother?

341
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,933
Of course! I have alreadypoached some

342
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,367
last season Bradleigh for thesilent auction.

343
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,500
There is nothing I wouldn't do

344
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,200
to keep HIV stigma-free!

345
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,167
You should throw her on stage,she

346
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,567
Can revive her old high schooltap routine.

347
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:04,467
I do a mean Shim-Sham-Shimmy.

348
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:05,800
Oh really?

349
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:07,433
Let's see those moves baby.

350
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,567
Oh, no one wants to see mymoves,

351
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:09,667

352
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:10,933
Oh, that's not fair.

353
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,700
No, it's not fair at all!

354
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,967
Okay

355
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,900
next time I get dumped in thereal world

356
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,333
it's going to be by someone hotlike Zeus,

357
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,167
Not some bi-polar mailman.

358
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:23,933
Tell it, girl.

359
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,767
Why o why I can't find astraight man?

360
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,300
Why can't I?

361
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:28,433
Why don't you try a straightbar?

362
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,800
Who'll go with me?

363
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,267
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

364
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,967
Okay, you don't need to goanywhere

365
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,600
We will find you a fag stag.

366
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,400
Riley is convinced that I'llfind straight man

367
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,300

368
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,100
Actually, a fag stag is urbanlegend.

00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,600
Okay, but you haveabout an hou r

before mama goes home for phonesex

372
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,400
She's not lying.

373
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,100
You know maybe Frisky Friends

374
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,600
is not the best way to meet aman.

375
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,767

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,967
Thank you.

396
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,800
Remember when Peter and Derekwere

397
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,500
looking for a surrogate fortheir gayby?

398
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,500
You know they asked Violet,right?

399
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,300

Seriously half the world hasone!

404
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,433
Who did they find? Derek'ssister.

405
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,700
I understand it; someone else'segg

406
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:38,967
She's just a surrogate but

407

What a beautiful gift of love

411
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,567
from Derek's sister.

412
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,533
It's not as if Derek could fallpregnant.

413
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,733
Well, he's been trying foryears.

414
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,500
Markus' new novel is actually

415

Is about a man who's giving abirth

416
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,600
Well it's about how life wouldbe different

417
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,633
if men could give birth.

418
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,267
Well, I'll tell you.

419
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,667
Abortion clinics on everycorner!

420
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,200
Oh, hold on!

421
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:04,967
Here comes the coat hangeragain.

422
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:07,633
I'm sorry, your balls are inthe way.

423
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,400
That's not funny!

424
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:11,600
That's not funny at all!

425
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,600
Your color is fantastic.

426
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,800
Who does it?

427
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,200

437

How about the hottie right overthere?

438
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:45,967
You are so mean to me.

439
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:47,367
Wait, who's that?

440
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,567
Riley says that's my fag stag.

441
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:49,733
Unicorn

442
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,767
Sweet, thanks!

443
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,433
Cheers! Drinks on me.

444
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,767
Oh my God.

445
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,867
Salome. OH MY GOD!

446
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,133
Are you dead?

447
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,367
What happened to you?

448
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,567
You look Amazing.

449
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,667

452
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:39,967
Okay?

453
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,000
Alright.

454
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,833
I am really worried.

455
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,967
When I don't eat, I get sleepy,okay?

456
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:48,433
Salome, you're naturally thin.

457
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,400
If I was you, Iâ€™donly be eatin g

458
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,433
And fucking.

459
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,267
Violet,

460
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,400
let me tell you something:

461
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,367
Fucking is overrated.

462
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,033
Guys line up around the blockto fuck me.

463
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,767
It is really tiresome.

464
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,867
There is a guy right here inthis diner

465
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,900
that wants to fuck me.

466
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,800
Who?

467
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:10,300
Black guy, Oscar Giovanniscarf, biceps.

468
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:11,933
He's behind you.

469
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,767
He doesn't know that he shouldknow

470
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,300
that I know he's cruising me,you know?

471
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,367
Wait.

472
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:20,767
He's actually cruising you.

473
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,900
Oh my god!

474
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:23,300
Just play aloof.

475
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:30,700
Violet!

476
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:32,100
Stop with the straw.

477
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,100
You lost him.

478
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,500
And you're gonna keep losingthem

479
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,200
until you get off your racket.

480
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,900
My racket?

481
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:44,967
Your racket is what's stoppingyou.

482
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,567
Well, I don't look like you.

483
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,600
It's not just your looks.

484
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,067
There is someone for everyone.

485
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,467
I believe that.

486
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,467
Thanks.

487
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,267
Let me ask you something.

488
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,500
where were you earlier?

489
00:19:58,567 --> 00:19:59,600
Out with the boys.

490
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,467
Okay.

491
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,867
Do you know that story in thenews about

492
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,333
the family of peacocks that

493
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,467
took in the orphan elephant?

494
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:07,933
Oh, yes.

495
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,267
And then theelephant ran aroun d

496
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,467
thinking it was a peacock?

497
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:12,900
So sweet.

498
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,400
It's not sweet.

499
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:15,933
It's ridiculous.

500
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,367
Picture it!

501
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,000
Violet, you are not a peacock!

502
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,067
You are an...

503
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,100
Have you ever thought maybeyour gay

504
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:27,833
friends just don't wanna shareyou?

505
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,400
No.

506
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:30,567
They wanna keep you wrapped upin

507
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:31,967
their own little world

508
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,433
away from men who want women.

509
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,233
That's a horrible thing to say.

510
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,133
Do you wanna get married andhave kids?

511
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,433
No.

512
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,233
See?

513
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,067
The gays have totally warpedyour mind.

514
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,233
They do refuse to go tostraight bars.

515
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,900
And they are always insultingmy pussy.

516
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:54,500
But no, my friends want what Iwant.

517
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:57,900
Okay.

518
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,067
Okay what?

519
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:02,633
You're not willing to becoachable.

520
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,733
I am!

521
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,867
I'm coachable.

522
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,333
Then I can help.

523
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:11,567
God...

524
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:13,400
I ate so much.

525
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm just gonna hit the ladies'room.

526
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:26,200
It might be a minute or two.

527
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:35,233
Just pick a number.

528
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,333
10,000 words a day.

529
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,600
I wish...

530
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,567
it's just that... you know

531
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,233
their baby is born and I'velost the plot

532
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,900
Maybe male mothers eat theiryoung.

533
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:49,967
Thanks, that's very helpful.

534
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,867
Baby!

535
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:56,733
Gays don't breed.

536
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,933
It's what separates us from theanimals.

537
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,400
We should invest in

538
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:01,967
valuable real estate instead.

539
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,033
Let's do that...

540
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,200
How about that rooftop

541
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:05,200
at Audrey's reception?

542
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:07,167
How about...

543
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:08,733
this valuable real estate, ha?Right here...

544
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,500
It's looking a bit neglected.

545
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:11,633
Seriously...

546
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,033
we're not breeders.

547
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,200
We don't have to worry about

548
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:15,533
the rest of the planet.

549
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,867
Global warming, recycling...

550
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:19,133
Oh, I would hate to recycle!

551
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,867
So why not write about that?

552
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,633
Because I'm writing a fantasy,Riley.

553
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Your husband is an idealist.

554
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:29,500
Doll, I love you...

555
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:31,333
but I'm not your husband.

556
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,233
It's their word.

557
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,767
It could be our word.

558
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:41,433
Pear puree?

559
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,967
What's this?

560
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:44,533
Just research...

561
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:47,667
Okay...

562
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,067
I've got an idea...

563
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:51,633
I wanna take you out tomorrownight

564
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,633
for some solid food.

565
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,667
Cheer you up.

566
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,433
I love you.

567
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,933
I love my husband!

568
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:03,367
I love you

569
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:04,967
I love my husband!

570
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:07,233
I love you

571
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,367
Ah... husband

572
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:12,767
Just found this at the fleamarket!

573
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,367
What do you think?

574
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:15,733
Cute, ha?

575
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,433
You can drape it

576
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,067
you can belt it, you can crimpit!

577
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,200
You can knock it off in China

578
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:21,300
for 50 cents pop.

579
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,333
Precisely.

580
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:24,600
Make that happen.

581
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:27,900
Remind me to give this splendorto

582
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,733
Donna when she gets back.

583
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Oh hey!

584
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:34,467
Drinks tonight?

585
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,833
Markus has writers' group.

586
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,600
I have a dinner date tonight

587
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,900
and I don't plan on coming homeafter.

588
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:41,200
Not another frisky friend?

589
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:42,367
Why do you say it like that

590
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:44,367
"another frisky friend"?

591
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,600
What? You want me all toyourself?

592
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:46,633
Or what?!?

593
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:50,833
Wow!

594
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,433
That's beauty coupon for

595
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,533
a silent auction I'm doing

596
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,633
I just gave it to you.

597
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,500
Okay, thanks

598
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:58,733
I actually wanted to speak withDarian

599
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,633
about another matter...

600
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,467
I already told you Darian iswith a client.

601
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,067
Hey yo! Darian, hey!

602
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,900
Am I invisible?

603
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,600
Yeah, to me.

604
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:10,700
Darian listen, is now a badtime?

605
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:12,467
Now is good.

606
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,400
Okay, thanks so much for thiscoupon

607
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:18,433
Can we speak in private?

608
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,167
Since when do you care aboutprivate?

609
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:22,633
Okay.

610
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,467

00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,000
Um.. why?

614
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,600
Well, you know that story in abook

615
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,700
with Noah and ...animals and

616
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,233
Wait, wait, wait.. Noah's Ark?

617
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,767
And a bird brought Noah a twig

618
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,367
which meant everything is gonnabe okay.

619
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,233
So, you're here as...

620
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,667

I'm here to show you just howmuch

622

00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:53,967
Wow! Luke... thank you...

624
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,200

625

The rest of your stuff.. frommy apartment.

628
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,433
Don't... don't cry

629
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
You know you like that one...aah come on!

630
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,567
Good boy!

631

Put on there now... no, on topof it, ok?

632
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:45,533
Put it on there.

633
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:52,000
Little person.

634
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:57,167
Um... this is Joey.

635
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,700
Say hi Joey

636
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,433

Ashley's sitter called insick...

638
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,167

My mentor from writers group

640
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,867
And how often does Ashley'ssitter

641
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,633
call in sick?

642
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,133
Oh... um.. just Fridays...

643
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
sometimes Wednesdays.

644
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,667
You couldn't tell me?

645
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:19,200
You know, sometimes you're notthat easy

646
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:20,500
to talk to aboutcertain things .

647
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,300
Not that easy to talk to...

648
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:23,533
Ashley's just running late..

649
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,433
she'll be here any minute.

650

You know this gig can help ussave.

Okay, what the hell is going onhere?

672
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:34,333
You're deliberately trying tohurt me?

673
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,867
Take it easy, Luke...

674
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:40,400
Haven't you heard about theimpalas in Africa?

00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:45,933

Air hostesses!

Oh, yes.

683
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,733
In the unlikely events of waterlanding,

684
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,500
you're all gonna die!

685
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:00,367
That's nice!

686
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,133
I'll be back to get your ordersin a bit.

687
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,167
Okay.

688
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,100
Air hostess, ha?

689
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,033
Oh, my ticket out of Idaho.

690
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,167
I got some buddies out West...

691
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:10,467
Thatâ€™s beautiful country.

692
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:11,733
Uh, beautiful yeah, but...

693
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,967
all anyone wants for you is

694
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:15,167
the same old stuff...get married, have kids.

695
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,567
I want something different.

696
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,100
Yeah, I hear you.

697
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,733
Yeah?

698
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,367
Yeah, we're an island ofmisfits.

699
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,567
I actually moved here to bearound

700
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:24,267
more open-minded women.

701
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,000
You still in thefriendly skies ?

702
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:29,933
No, I had to give it up.

703
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,133
Oh, after 9/11?

704
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,067
Oh, no!

705
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:34,800
I just kept ballooning up onthe plane food

706
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,167
No way.

707
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,900
Oh, yes way. I mean Donnie

708
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,633
Donnie used to have a 29 inchwaist

709
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,967
I mean I lost most of what Iput on,

710
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,500
I mean except for my fupa...

711
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:43,700
but I'm fine with it.

712
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:45,933
Umm, with what?

713
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:49,333
Fupa. Fat Upper Pussy Area.

714
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,533
But... it's a little fupa, ahappy fupa.

715
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,033
I would hate to see an angryone.

716
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh yeah we can't have that.

717
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,200
Uh, what would you recommend?

718
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:04,200
The chicken cutlet here isexcellent.

719
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:05,667
But I would stay away fromcheese

720
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:07,400
tonight if I were you.

721
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:08,633
Why is that?

722
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,200
Clogs up your anal cavity.

723
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:12,533
I did not know that.

724
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,900
Oh, except for goat cheese.

725
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:15,000
You know there is some enzyme

726
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,400
that makes it okay.

727
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,633
This isn't good dinnerconversation, is it?

728
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,300
No, no, no... be yourself.

729
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:25,700
Um.. I hear zucchini is greatfor down there.

730
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:28,233
Most veggies are...okra is thebest.

731
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,500
I'm all about anal health.

732
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,067
Oh, me too.

733
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,000
It's just good manners.

734
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,100
So, are you kids ready?

735
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:39,600
Yes. I'll have the chickenfried steak, please.

736
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:40,633
Chicken fried steak, you sir?

737
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,667
Just a burger.

738
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:42,733
Burger.

739
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,767
No cheese!

740
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:47,600
Oh, that's work, I've gottatake this.

741
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:48,700
Okay.

742
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:55,033
Oh, sweetie he's fine!

743
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,200
I don't know why you're

744
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:58,067
bothering with dinner.

745
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,233
You're right put in that order,pronto!

746
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,800

747
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:22,067
That was the best sex of mylife.

748
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:23,667
You're so high energy.

749
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,400
You want games?

750
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,700
I'll out-slut you in a second.

751
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,100
Hey, round two at my place?

752
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:35,500
This time, I'll doall the work .

753
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,467
What are you doing home?

754
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:00,233
You're supposed to be gone allnight.

755
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,500
Well, you're cleaning? It'sFriday.

756
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:02,733
Aren't you supposed to be

757
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,633
bringing queers together?

758
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,033
Well,

759
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,767
It smells like poppers in here

760
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,700
Where did you have your party?

761
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:10,467
The police raided our lastlocation.

762
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:11,500
So..

763
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:12,600
So?

764
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,000
No!

765
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,400
You got home before I could...

766
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,833
Is that shit on my bedspread?

767
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,500
That's not shit.

768
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:20,100
That is shit!

769
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:21,833
No, that isdefinitely not shit .

770
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,933
It's biss.

771
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Biss?

772
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:25,867
Butt piss.

773
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:27,567
Oh God! That is so gross Luke,oh my god!

774
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:28,667
I'm sorry! Somebody must havegone

775
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,000
overboard with enemas.

776
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:31,300
I'm... I'm doing laundry now

777
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:32,467
Listen I was gonna tell you

778
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:33,900
but I thought maybe...

779
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:35,500
You thought maybe Iwould objec t

780
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:36,800
to a gay sex party in mybedroom?

781
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,100
That doesn't turn you on?

782
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,967
No, it does not turn me on.

783
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,000
That's the problem. I'm not oneof you.

784
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,600
Salome was right

785
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:44,433
I've just become way tooenmeshed

786
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,633
in your world.

787
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,000
Listen, I'm sorry.

788
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:48,633
I'm gonna wash everything...

789
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,700
It's OKAY because I'memancipating

790
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,367
myself from this...

791
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:52,833
Is that biss on thetable cloth ?

792
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,233
It's not my biss.

793
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,400
I don't care whose biss it is!

794
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,900
And he just left a twenty.Cheap fucker!

795
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:02,833
He walked out on you?

796
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,933
Just like that?

797
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,333
Were you being outrageous?

798
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,900
I may have been a littleoutrageous.

799
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:12,167
This is more than cosmetic

800
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:13,700
you know that, right?

801
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,200
Make-up can clear blemishes andstuff...

802
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:18,867
but not even top of the line

803
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:21,233
L'Oreal can fix a fucked upface.

804
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,567
And what we have here is afucked up face.

805
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:28,667
What are you saying?

806
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,467
I'm saying surgery.

807
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,967
You need to go under knife andkill

808
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:34,533
the fag hag inside.

809
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:38,300
Yes, okay. She's gone.

810
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:39,967
Just snip her out.

811
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,100
She's dead.

812
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,567
Great.

813
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:43,800
So what are you doing Thursday?

814
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:45,967
Going out with... friends.

815
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,167
It's our ritual.

816
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,500
It's your racket.

817
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:52,900
Are you coachable?

818
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:56,567
Yes, I'm coachable. What'shappening?

819
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:58,500
Well, a promoter friend of mine

820
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,600
is launching a new weekly partyThursdays

821
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,733
at Fine Feline.

822
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,333
Want to be my plus-one?

823
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,967
You want me to beyour plus-one ?

824
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:10,400
I celebrate diversity, you knowthat.

825
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,333
Plus I owe you one.

826
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:15,900
Salome wow I'm...

827
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:17,567
I'm very flattered.

828
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:20,067
I'm gonna have a table withbottle service

829
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,533
and everything.

830
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,033
Did you know Markus was running

831
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,300
a nursery out of our apartment?

832
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:25,333
Maybe.

833
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,333
Why didn't you tell me?

834
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,033
Why is nobody talking to me?

835
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,333
It's all on the blog.

836
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,367
And I'm not going to be able

837
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:33,733
to go out Thursday.

838
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,200
Why not?

839
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,067
Because you're a cock-blocker.

840
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,067
No, Riley.

841
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,567
It's because I'm never gonnaget what I want

842
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:43,633
if I keep repeating the same

843
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,100
patterns of behavior.

844
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,367
In other words... cock-blocker.

845
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,533
What should I wear on Thursday?

846
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,233
Uh.. okay let me see...

847
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,133
Let the pussy out of the bag...

848
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,300
Dress code: the cattier thebetter

849
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,800
Are you wearing a fucking catsuit?

850
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,867
Thank you very much.

851
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,267

854
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:37,033
Home.

855
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,333
Isn't this the outfit you wore

856
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
to the fetish ball...2007?

857
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,033
Good memory.

858
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,733
Yeah, well I always notice you.

859
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,367
Oh, you might be the only one.

860
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:48,400
Careful!

861
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Do you ever just feel like youdon't

862
00:36:52,267 --> 00:36:54,000
belong anywhere?

863
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:57,333
Hello.

864
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,700
Why do you think I was so biginto heroin.

865
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,200
You're clean now, right?

866
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:03,200
Yes, two years.

867
00:37:04,633 --> 00:37:06,000
Damn.

868
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,733
Look... Violet...

869
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,867
Before I came here, before youever knew

870
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:21,733
me, no one wanted a thing to dowith me.

871
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,767
I swear, not anyone.

872
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,733
Well, now we have all thesefriends

873
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,833
and they...

874
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,667
They love us.

875
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:34,133
They shower us with all thisattention

876
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,967
Yeah, I mean, that doesn't hurteither.

877
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,833
Well, attention doesn't sleepwith you

878
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,900
at night...

879
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:47,533
well, not with me.

880
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:51,967
Come here

881
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,133
It's alright.

882
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,367
Sorry.

883
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,000
No, it's not you. It's just...

884
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,700
I'm positive, you know.

885
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,167
It's just kissing.

886
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:32,233
Some people won't even share

887
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,867
the same spoon.

888
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:35,600
Some people are stupid.

889
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:38,767
Ah, I'm stupid.

890
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,433
Why am I kissing a gay boy?God !

891
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,533
I'm retired.

892
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,767
Retired?

893
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,733
I want to be wanted, Zeus.

894
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
It's not fair to me, okay?

895
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,400
This fruit fly is finished.

896
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:03,900
You have one new frisky friend.

897
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,467
Hi! Salome...

898
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:07,400
My dad owns the general store

899
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,167
of the Idaho town where I grewup.

900
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:11,033
He expected me to take it overbut I

901
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,367
came to New York to become anarchitect.

902
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:14,433
I'm Vern and I would love to

903
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,933
hear your story.

904
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,000
Vern?

905
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:21,200
Violet! Hey, are you home?

906
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:22,533
No.

907
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,867
Can we talk?

908
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:25,033
No.

909
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,300
Are you on that phone lineagain?

910
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:27,333
No!

911
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,800
I need love.

912
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:32,900
Me too.

913
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:43,400
I miss Darian.

914
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,400
You try too hard, women don'tdo that.

915
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:51,467
I am just being myself.

916
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,267
Exactly. Stop it.

917
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:56,433
Now just close your eyes

918
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,567
and simply ask the universe.

919
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,233
The benevolent universe willalways

920
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,067
manifest what you need.

921
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:08,833
That's not true.

922
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,100
If I fall from a ten-storybuilding,

923
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,967
am I gonna manifest wings?

924
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,567
No. But you can manifest atruckload of

925
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:19,700
mattresses on the street below.

926
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,400
You watch too many cartoons.

927
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,200
What? It could happen.

928
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,767
Gerald?

929
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,000
Salome.

930
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:31,200
How are you gorgeous?

931
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:32,467
Can I get you a non-fat soylatte?

932
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:36,033
Yes... what a coincidence.

933
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,067
See Violet I was justmanifesting

934
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:39,900
a non-fat soy latte.

935
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,800
Fine Feline was major, ha?

936
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:43,667
So major.

937
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:48,000
Well, Violet didn't like it.

938
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:49,367
Not major.

939
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:52,300
Oh, cat-woman.

940
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,400
Go on Gerald...

941
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,100
Don't forget 16 splendas

942
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,167
and a stir-stick, thanks.

943
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,833
Voila.

944
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,467
Notice my lack of effort?

945
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:07,667
The lesson here is that theuniverse would

946
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:09,900
never tell you to put on apleather catsuit...

947
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,000
so don't try so hard next time,ok?

948
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:14,967
Oh, I'm not going back toFine Feline again.

949
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:17,433
You promised youwere coachable .

950
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,100
I'm gonna coach myself.

951
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:21,833
You can't coach yourself!

952
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,533
You'll never manifest a manthat way.

953
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,433
There's more then one way toskin a cat.

954
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:34,233
That's funny... not true.

955
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,400
But funny.

956
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:38,200
Yeah, when we meet, I'll takeyou

957
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:39,933
on a tour of lost gems.

958
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,833
I'm very sentimental when itcomes

959
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,267
to architecture.

960
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,933
I adore sentimental men, Vern.

961
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,233
We'll start with the Roxy.

962
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,133
The Roxy! You've been?

963
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,567
Spanish inspired interior, thesoaring

964
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,133
columns, it's rococo stylerotunda.

965
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,167
The Roxy had a rococo rotunda?

966
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:57,333
I really wish I could have seenit.

967
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,367
Oh my gosh, I used to go allthe time.

968
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,600
How? It was demolished in 1961.

969
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,233
The gay club?

970
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,533
No! The Roxy was amovie palace .

971
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,233
Where the Rockettes began.

972
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,500
The high-kicking, showgirlRockettes?

973
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:12,467
Originally they were theRoxy-ettes.

974
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,333
Oh, the Roxy.

975
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,200
You know there's a famousLife Magazine

976
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,167
shot of Gloria Swanson standingon the

977
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:21,100
rubble in a red boa as theytore it down.

978
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,133
Gloria Swanson in a red boa?

979
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,767
I have manifested a fag stag.

980
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,200
You manifested a fag.

981
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:30,400
Gloria Steinem neverwore a boa .

982
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,600
Gloria Swanson. Vern isstraight!

983
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:33,700
Bradleigh, do straight men knowwho

984
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:35,333
Gloria Swanson is?

985
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,333
Norma Desmond? Only if they'regay.

986
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,100
Come on!

987
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:40,367
Only gays obsess over faded,deluded,

988
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,567
once beautiful women.

989
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:43,633
We can relate.

990
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,867
See!

991
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:46,567
Climax Magazine is here.

992
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:47,600
Marjorie Max.

993
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,100
Violet, skedaddle.

994
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:52,800
Gentlemen.

995
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:53,833
Marjorie!

996
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,933
Right this way.

997
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,100
The inspiration for this seasonis

998
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:01,633
punk, Pocahontas andprehistoric.

999
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:06,733
Clever. I see we're intoalliteration.

1000
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,967
This frill must be theâ€œprehistoric.

1001
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:13,633
Pterodactyl in heat?

1002
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,667
More or less.

1003
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:21,967
Ah, fur. You have no qualmsabout

1004
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,733
killing these cute littlecritters?

1005
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,933
Bradleigh says fur comes fromtrees.

1006
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,967
Fir trees.

1007
00:43:29,433 --> 00:43:31,867
Look at me, pretending to care.

1008
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,800
I just don't see how it fits tomy story.

1009
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:40,633
I've seen you in Climax before.

1010
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,467
I modeled for the magazineonce, yes.

1011
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:44,800
Oh don't remind me, long timeago.

1012
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:48,100
It was a matinee idol story?

1013
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,667
Yeah.

1014
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:51,600
This mug once was verylucrative.

1015
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:53,833
And perfect for the "Daddy" inthis fall's

1016
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,667
editorial shot byStephen Miser !

1017
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:59,100
Stephen Miser? Oh be still mybeating heart.

1018
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:00,500
What's the story?

1019
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:02,500
I love Daddy!

1020
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,933
But I'm not old enough to be aDaddy.

1021
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,100
Tell you what.

1022
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:15,300

1032
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:49,133
Hey Violet is not coming toyour reading,

1033
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,867
I think she's boycotting us.

1034
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:51,733
I can't believe I had to givehim a

1035
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,900
hysterectomy.

1036
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:54,167
It's changed everything.

1037
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,267

1038
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,600

00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:58,400
Sorry for Jim.

What trip?

1045
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:08,733

A chance to forget babies

1054
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:24,767
and hysterectomies.

1055
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:27,667
Oh my God, don't remind me.It's so sad!

00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,767
The monotony of our lives?

1068

But you go to gay bars, right?

1084

Why in the world would I dothat?

Don't be fooled.

1145
00:49:39,567 --> 00:49:41,733
He's an absolutely unmanageablechild.

1146
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,767

1149
00:49:48,567 --> 00:49:50,433

00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,767
Unless it's through my lens.

1154
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:02,300

in the US.

1164

Why in the world would I wannado that

1168
00:52:39,133 --> 00:52:41,900
When I can be with you alone.

1169
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:43,100
Do you go drinking a lot?

1170
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,567
I wouldn't say that.

1171
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,267
I may have partied a little inmy youth.

1172
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,667
But that is behind me.

1173

00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,000
And I didn't see anything

1189
00:54:04,067 --> 00:54:06,267
about refundsor exchanges.

1190
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:09,667
I also never imagined in myentire gay life

1191
00:54:09,733 --> 00:54:10,900
that the topic of children

1192
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:13,800
would ever come up.

1193
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:15,133
Neither did I. But

1194
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:17,233
I guess secretly

1195
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:19,867
I hoped that it would.

1196
00:54:22,933 --> 00:54:23,967
What is that?

1197
00:54:24,033 --> 00:54:24,967
Markus

1198
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:28,333
I love you

1199
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,267
I want you to have everythingyou want.

1200
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,533
Even if it's not what you want?

1201
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:34,733
How will I know if we don't geta chance

1202
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,767
to practice?

1203
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,000
Oh my god.

1204
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,800
You got me a Toy Pomeranian?

1205
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:43,067
You wanted a Toy Pomeranian

1206
00:54:43,133 --> 00:54:44,500
since you were ten.

1207
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:46,267
Well, that or a Chihuahua...

1208
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:49,833
and you know how I feel aboutrats.

1209
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,867
You've been reading my blog.

1210
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:55,400
Oh, Thank you.

1211
00:55:17,767 --> 00:55:19,700
I thought you werean ex-Mormon ?

1212
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:21,400
I left the church,

1213
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:23,067
but I haven't beenexcommunicated.

1214
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:24,400
Stick with me kid.

1215
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:27,600
Wait a minute.

1216
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,267
If you're not a Mormon, whycan't

1217
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:30,700
you enjoy a glass of wine withme?

1218
00:55:30,767 --> 00:55:31,900
I don't like it.

1219
00:55:33,533 --> 00:55:34,533
You told me you've never had adrink.

1220
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,233
I haven't.

1221
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,700
How do you know you don't likeit?

1222
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:42,400
Do I need to sleep with a man

1223
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:44,133
to know I don't like it?

1224
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:46,233
You know them?

1225
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:49,900
Ah, co-workers.

1226
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:53,667
Actually they are pretty great.

1227
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:56,533
Uhm...we could go out with themsometime,

1228
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,100
if you wanted to.

1229
00:55:58,167 --> 00:55:59,433
Where would we go?

1230
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:02,900
We could go to a gay bar.

1231
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:03,967
I think that'd be too muchanthropology

1232
00:56:04,033 --> 00:56:05,800
for this architect.

1233
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:10,600
I told you I'm not very social.

1234
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,867
Where do you go for fun?

1235
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:12,900
To sleep.

1236
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,767
I prefer to have my fun early.

1237
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,933
I'm a big fan ofcolumn-watching.

1238
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,300
Column-watching?

1239
00:56:20,367 --> 00:56:21,667
Yeah.

1240
00:56:21,733 --> 00:56:22,900
Tomorrow I'll be up before 5

1241
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:23,867
to catch them at sunrise.

1242
00:56:23,933 --> 00:56:24,933
Holy fuck!

1243
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,800
Sunrise?

1244
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:28,567
Yeah, sunrise is my favoritetime of day.

1245
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,533
Well, if you want to catch theworm.

1246
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,600
Or if you wanna see Corinthiancolumns

1247
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:32,833
come to life.

1248
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,400
So, you just uh...

1249
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,400
sit there and stare?

1250
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:39,333
It's a form of meditation forme.

1251
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,067
We all have our own way ofgetting centered

1252
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:42,133
in this crazy city and that'smine.

1253
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,433
Absolutely sweetie.

1254
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,167
I mean whatever it takes.

1255
00:56:45,233 --> 00:56:46,567
You must think I'm freak.

1256
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:49,067
Most people think I'm a freak.

1257
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:50,600
No!

1258
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:52,267
no, actually I don't.

1259
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,633
And I think columns aremagnificent.

1260
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:00,267
Do you wanna watchthem with me ?

1261
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,900
You might have to sleep over ifyou did.

1262
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:03,933
Check!

1263
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:11,800
Oh, okay.

1264
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:25,167
Have my babies, have my babies

1265
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,267
What?

1266
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:29,467
Just making sure the condom isstill on.

1267
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:30,633
Of course it is.

1268
00:57:34,267 --> 00:57:36,067
Have my babies, have my babies!

1269
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:38,900
Move to Idaho and have Chippy'sbabies.

1270
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,000
Look.

1271
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:54,133
Look now

1272
00:57:55,633 --> 00:57:56,833
Are you sleeping through this?

1273
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,633
No, just resting my eyes.

1274
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,633
Watch as the sun dances across

1275
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,900
the granite at each new moment.

1276
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,267
Watch.

1277
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,000
Look, magic.

1278
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,300
Hey! Guess what?

1279
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:18,700
You got a dog.

1280
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:20,667
-How'd you know?-Women know.

1281
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:23,567
I also know that you werenever going to get a dog.

1282
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,067
You have to bend over

1283
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:27,233
and pick up the poop. Remember?

1284
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,333
Baby makes Markus happy

1285
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,667
so I've changed.

1286
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,967
You called a dog Baby?

1287
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:35,667
You are such a lesbian.

1288
00:58:35,733 --> 00:58:36,767
Markus named him

1289
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:37,900
but thank you Donna.

1290
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:38,967
How's the hymen?

1291
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:40,300
You know my hymen -

1292
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:41,533
hanging in there.

1293
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:45,033
Come over tonight, meet Baby.

1294
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,133
Oh, I can't.

1295
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,567
Dinner with Vern.

1296
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:48,367
Pre-game before Zeus' benefit

1297
00:58:48,433 --> 00:58:49,567
at Vlada?

1298
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:50,800
Oh, that's Friday night.

1299
00:58:50,867 --> 00:58:52,567
Oh shit!

1300
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:53,567
I have plans with Vern Fridaynight.

1301
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:54,700
Vern, Vern, Vern.

1302
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:55,800
Bring Vern.

1303
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:57,567
Uhm

1304
00:58:57,633 --> 00:59:00,000
I don't think he's gonna wantto go.

1305
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:01,800
We're all dying to meet him.

1306
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:04,367
The timing is just not right.

1307
00:59:04,433 --> 00:59:05,967
I'm just not comfortable having

1308
00:59:06,033 --> 00:59:07,633
him know about my past.

1309
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,900
What's wrong with your past?

1310
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,100
Oh, please

1311
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:12,233
don't take it personal.

1312
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,767
You know the truth is

1313
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:16,900
I don't even know if Vern's mytype.

1314
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:18,600
So you'd rather be with himthan with us

1315
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:19,900
for a cause you've alwayssupported?

1316
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:22,067
Don't worry, I'll stop by.

1317
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:23,933
You act like it'ssuch a burden .

1318
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,533
I said I'll stop by, so leaveit alone.

1319
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,933
Dating is stressful enoughwithout

1320
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,333
this extra pressure from you,

1321
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,700
and texts from Luke.

1322
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,733
and these super pokes from

1323
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,467
friends on Facebook I don'teven know!

1324
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,033
Love,

1325
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,333
Vern

1326
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,000
It's tough being popular.

1327
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:46,533
I'm gonna name my first bornDaisy.

1328
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:49,967
It's that time of the month,huh?

1329
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:51,467
I hate when men do that.

1330
00:59:51,533 --> 00:59:53,433
Why do men always say that?

1331
00:59:57,267 --> 00:59:58,633
Wow.

1332
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,033
The billionaire that got away

1333
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,733
used to send me pink daisies.

1334
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,267
Letting him get away is thebiggest regret

1335
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,067
of my life.

1336
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:08,800
Not because we had anything incommon.

1337
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:10,800
We didn't.

1338
01:00:10,867 --> 01:00:12,900
But it was this game he lovedcalled Snooker

1339
01:00:12,967 --> 01:00:14,567
Whatâ€™s that?

1340
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:16,833
I donâ€™t really know.

1341
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,567
And you point is?

1342
01:00:18,633 --> 01:00:20,300
My point is

1343
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,267
I never bothered to learnSnooker

1344
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,800
and now heâ€™s on a yacht in theMaldives

1345
01:00:23,867 --> 01:00:25,333
with someone who did.

1346
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,433
Was the sex good?

1347
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,533
Standard missionary.

1348
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,267
Vern, too.

1349
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:33,967
Really vanilla.

1350
01:00:34,033 --> 01:00:36,633
We donâ€™t have that much incommon, either.

1351
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,000
Violet

1352
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,233
this guy sends you flowers.

1353
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,333
He actually likes you.

1354
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,933
He does, he likes me.

1355
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,467
So heâ€™s got possibility.

1356
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:50,400
And compatibility is notpossibility.

1357
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:52,200
All youâ€™ve got to do now

1358
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:54,367
is fake interest in whatinterests him.

1359
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:56,033
And then after that heâ€™s yoursto mold

1360
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,567
any old way you want.

1361
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,700
Am I right Donna?

1362
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,133
What the fuck do you want?

1363
01:01:09,367 --> 01:01:11,267
You should want this.

1364
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,600
Heâ€™s boring.

1365
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,167
Do you want to be loved,

1366
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:15,667
or do you want to beentertained?

1367
01:01:15,733 --> 01:01:17,267
I wanna be entertained?

1368
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:18,900
No, no, no!!

1369
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,633
What happened to my veganwedding?

1370
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,567
Yeah, okay

1371
01:01:22,633 --> 01:01:25,667
Yes, fine I stole yourstanky ass strap-on!

1372
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,000
In a roundabout way,

1373
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:30,233
Donna is supporting what Iâ€™msaying.

1374
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,633
I doubt that.

1375
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,500
And what are you saying?

1376
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,767
Compatibility is notpossibility.

1377
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,133
Violet

1378
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,467
learn the Snooker.

1379
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:06,867
You watching me?

1380
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,367
Maybe

1381
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:13,833
How are things going at thesalon?

1382
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,867
Ahhdrama.

1383
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:18,633
Had to fire my receptionist.

1384
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,700
She was a bitch.

1385
01:02:19,767 --> 01:02:20,733
Yeah.

1386
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:24,133
Shall we

1387
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,367
call a truce

1388
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:27,900
to the dueling sluts?

1389
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:30,500
Maybe.

1390
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,133
Youâ€™re here!!

1391
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:39,100
Oh my god! Did you see thesilent auction?

1392
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:40,400
No!

1393
01:02:40,467 --> 01:02:41,767
I made Markus put money on

1394
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:42,833
Liza Minelliâ€™s g-string.

1395
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,033
And Iâ€™m winning!

1396
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,267
You guys are bombed.

1397
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:49,200
Open bar. Hello!

1398
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:50,700
What can we get you to drink?

1399
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,633
No, nothing I canâ€™t be drunk

1400
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,500
when I see Vern

1401
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:55,667
Oh, sorry I missedyour reading .

1402
01:02:55,733 --> 01:02:56,833
Oh, thatâ€™s okay.

1403
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,133
Violet turned down afree drink ?

1404
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:03,300
I know, sheâ€™s

1405
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:04,100
not herself.

1406
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:05,133
I told you.

1407
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:08,733
Thank you so much for all yoursupport

1408
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,533
and encouragement.

1409
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,500
Just wait, I mention you in myspeech.

1410
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:14,200
To think you used to let peopleassume

1411
01:03:14,267 --> 01:03:17,700
you were just some dumbstripper.

1412
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:19,200
Cha-ching! I have found itâ€™sbest not to

1413
01:03:19,267 --> 01:03:21,133
challenge peopleâ€™s assumptions

1414
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,800
Who said a go-go boy canâ€™t bethe hero?

1415
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,033
I know

1416
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,067
Hey you gonna join us onThursday at Gym Bar?

1417
01:03:28,133 --> 01:03:29,500
I wonâ€™t.

1418
01:03:29,567 --> 01:03:31,133
In fact tonight

1419
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,567
sort of my cameo appearance.

1420
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:36,900
Retirement?

1421
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,467
Whatâ€™s that about?

1422
01:03:40,533 --> 01:03:43,467
Come on. Sounds like youâ€™rerunning away from home to me.

1423
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:45,233
Iâ€™m doing whatâ€™s best for me.

1424
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,700
Are you sure about this?

1425
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:49,400
You wanna talk about it?

1426
01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:51,167
Iâ€™d love to

1427
01:03:51,233 --> 01:03:53,267
but itâ€™s the pumpkin hour.

1428
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:54,767
Congratulations.

1429
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:56,900
6:30?

1430
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:58,367
You canâ€™t leave.

1431
01:03:58,433 --> 01:04:00,567
Youâ€™re gonna miss my speech.

1432
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:02,267
No, you canâ€™t leave.

1433
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:04,367
Come on stay and then

1434
01:04:04,433 --> 01:04:05,433
Afterwards you can come back

1435
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,200
to my place...

1436
01:04:07,267 --> 01:04:09,567
weâ€™ll bake cookies, watchBeaches.

1437
01:04:09,633 --> 01:04:10,733
I have Kylie Karaoke.

1438
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,700
I love Kylie Karaoke!

1439
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:14,100
Well, then say yes.

1440
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:17,000
I'm terrified of rejection.

1441
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:18,667
Oh, you have never beenrejected!

1442
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:19,767
in your life.

1443
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,600
You have no idea.

1444
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,333
And Zeus said you're working on

1445
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,300
an anti-violence benefit next.

1446
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,500
And one for the Trevor Projectafter that.

1447
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:34,133
I'm impressed.

1448
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,167
Thanks.

1449
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:37,633
Yeah, Zeus is really insistentwe reach out to

1450
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,633
straight people too, which is...

1451
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,367
kind of intimidating since Idon't know any.

1452
01:04:41,433 --> 01:04:43,367
Except for Violet, but yeah...

1453
01:04:43,433 --> 01:04:44,400
always Violet.

1454
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,033
This sounds like a greatopportunity.

1455
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,200
Who knows there might be hopefor you yet.

1456
01:04:50,267 --> 01:04:52,033
What do you mean hope for me?

1457
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,900
Just hope... you break out ofyour limited gay world.

1458
01:04:55,967 --> 01:04:59,133
Oh, that's rich coming from ahairdresser.

1459
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,900
Hair-stylist.

1460
01:05:00,967 --> 01:05:02,600
Whatever. Still not much hopefor you.

1461
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:03,733
Can you please stop with thegames?

1462
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,733
You started the games.

1463
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,933
Well, I'm through.

1464
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,100
You want to keep playing,

1465
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:07,933
play with someone else.

1466
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,967
I often do.

1467
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,267
Max, I just want you to knowthat you are

1468
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:14,267
this close to having me.

1469
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:17,267
Luke, I'm really sorry but Ican't talk now.

1470
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,667
He is on the clock.

1471
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,600
Oh, for Heaven sake!

1472
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,567
Zeus

1473
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:26,733
kiss me.

1474
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,133
Luke, I am flattered.

1475
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,600
Don't be.

1476
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:31,133
Just take me homeand ravage me .

1477
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,000
Ah Zeus, I've got issues.

1478
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:35,333
Yes, you do.

1479
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,733
You got issues too.

1480
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,600
are we gonna be alone forever?

1481
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:39,800
It depends on your definitionof alone,

1482
01:05:39,867 --> 01:05:40,867
doesn't it?

1483
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:43,700
How long have you been in thecity now?

1484
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:45,100
About 4 years.

1485
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:46,333
4 years and I have never once

1486
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,533
seen you with a boyfriend.

1487
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,400
Nope.

1488
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:51,133
You never come to my sexparties either.

1489
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,433
You know I have poz events.

1490
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,967
They're not my thing.

1491
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,933
So what gets you going,big boy ?

1492
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,467
It's way off your radar.

1493
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:03,500
I wonder if you'd even treat methe same if you knew.

1494
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:05,000
Two boys, one plunger.

1495
01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:06,567
Ewww, no.

1496
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:08,967
Bartender, can I get a drink?

1497
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:10,167
One second.

1498
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:11,667
What happened to Violet?

1499
01:06:11,733 --> 01:06:13,333
She just bolted out of here.

1500
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,500
What's going on with your BFF?

1501
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:16,867
My BFF is MIA.

1502
01:06:17,867 --> 01:06:18,833
She is uhm

1503
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:21,833
She's dating somebody.

1504
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:22,933
What?

1505
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,600
Wh...who?

1506
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:26,000
Who's she dating?

1507
01:06:30,033 --> 01:06:31,000
Unicorn?

1508
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,500
The mythical Uuunicorn!

1509
01:06:34,567 --> 01:06:35,933
Shhhh!

1510
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,633
I'm not ready to come out yet.

1511
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,867
Oh!

1512
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:40,967
Oh you are fascinating.

1513
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,567
Well so what? I mean myroommate is gay.

1514
01:06:47,633 --> 01:06:48,700
Does he have HIV?

1515
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:49,867
No.

1516
01:06:49,933 --> 01:06:51,333
But what if he did?

1517
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,533
Well then I'd be concerned for

1518
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,967
your health and safety.

1519
01:06:54,033 --> 01:06:55,033
See, this is why weneed to mak e

1520
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,933
HIV stigma-free.

1521
01:06:58,467 --> 01:07:01,033
Why shouldn't HIVhave a stigma ?

1522
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,733
I mean it is preventable.

1523
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,700
What about 70's high-rises andpre-

1524
01:07:04,767 --> 01:07:06,767
fabricated homes, they have astigma, right?

1525
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,467
Okay, but we're talking aboutpeople.

1526
01:07:08,533 --> 01:07:10,200
People, not buildings.

1527
01:07:10,267 --> 01:07:11,400
What is wrong with you?

1528
01:07:11,467 --> 01:07:12,867
You're absolutely right.

1529
01:07:12,933 --> 01:07:14,733
I'm sorry, I'm just frustrated.

1530
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,700
I've been after theseBiedermeier chairs

1531
01:07:15,767 --> 01:07:16,400
on e-bay all day.

1532
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:18,267
Oh, well

1533
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,433
If you're outbid, there'll beothers.

1534
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,100
You're a patient man.

1535
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,400
It's not everyday you findmatching

1536
01:07:22,467 --> 01:07:24,233
Beidermeier chairs on e-bay.

1537
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,467
Where would they fit in yourapartment?

1538
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:26,767
I'm shipping them back to

1539
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:28,367
my folks with all the rest.

1540
01:07:28,433 --> 01:07:30,000
Oh, you're moving back?

1541
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:31,033
Eventually.

1542
01:07:32,767 --> 01:07:34,033
Idaho's not really columncountry,

1543
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,100
I'm afraid.

1544
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,167
Bonneville is one of thefastest growing

1545
01:07:38,233 --> 01:07:39,533
counties in the country.

1546
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,233
So there is plenty of work,

1547
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,433
and I'll be renovating thehomestead.

1548
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,933
You'd love my folks.

1549
01:07:45,267 --> 01:07:48,100
Would you ever consider movingback?

1550
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:50,533
I kinda moved away on purpose.

1551
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,100
Me, too.

1552
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:53,200
But I look around at my friends

1553
01:07:53,267 --> 01:07:54,733
and co-workers and...

1554
01:07:55,633 --> 01:07:57,100
they don't mean much.

1555
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:01,567
I think what really mattersis...

1556
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:02,600
who matters.

1557
01:08:06,133 --> 01:08:07,100
Vern,

1558
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:09,600
teach me about the Snooker

1559
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:11,667
I mean the Beidermeier.

1560
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:13,533
Why do you love it so?

1561
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:17,100
Beidermeier is an unpretentiousclassic.

1562
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:18,167
Devoid of...

1563
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,333
unnecessary embellishment.

1564
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:25,767
You can keep taking things off,you know.

1565
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,533
Not to change the subject

1566
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,700
but have you had cheese today?

1567
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:41,367
I don't think so.

1568
01:08:41,433 --> 01:08:43,033
I took this tantric class

1569
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,900
on the sacred spot massage.

1570
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:46,867
Would you let me...

1571
01:08:46,933 --> 01:08:50,367
help you release some of thate-bay tension?

1572
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:51,800
Babe, you could showLe Corbusier the

1573
01:08:51,867 --> 01:08:54,000
golden ratio in a Frank Gehry.

1574
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,667
Now, just relax and trust me.

1575
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Ooops, sorry!

1576
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:04,233
My bad.

1577
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,167
Who's that?

1578
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:14,433
Oh never mind, just relax.

1579
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,100
I got 8 inches for you.

1580
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:20,533
You want my 8 inches?

1581
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:23,733
What, you gonna fuck me twice?

1582
01:09:25,233 --> 01:09:26,467
Most men hold their tension

1583
01:09:26,533 --> 01:09:28,167
in the pelvic floor

1584
01:09:28,233 --> 01:09:29,267
which is why the sacred spotmassage

1585
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:31,200
is so important.

1586
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:33,367
I mean it really makes you morepeaceful.

1587
01:09:33,433 --> 01:09:34,600
That's why you don't see the

1588
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:36,400
gays marching off to war.

1589
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:39,733
Who's that?

1590
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,300
Shhhh.

1591
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:43,333
Okay, here we go.

1592
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:52,167
That's so wild.

1593
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:55,300
It's good, ha?

1594
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,133
Chippy likes wild.

1595
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:05,667
Wild is good.

1596
01:10:09,867 --> 01:10:11,000
Hey, I can see you're busy

1597
01:10:11,067 --> 01:10:12,867
but can I borrow a condom.

1598
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:24,400
Take this blindfold off.

1599
01:10:27,233 --> 01:10:28,800
Violet, you can't live likethis.

1600
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:30,733
I gotta get you outof here now .

1601
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,833
Come on you can stay with me.

1602
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:32,900
Okay, I'll pack.

1603
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:34,367
Let's just go.

1604
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:35,467
Now.

1605
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:36,533
Okay

1606
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,767
Help?

1607
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:38,800
Oh!

1608
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,533
Ashley adopted in Namibia.

1609
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,833
How was that experience?

1610
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,400
Better than giving birth,

1611
01:11:06,467 --> 01:11:08,100
Actually I'm not so sure.

1612
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:10,500
Africa can be notoriouslydifficult.

1613
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,033
Joey, play nice!

1614
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,033
So what are you writing thesedays?

1615
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,967
No more fiction, no.

1616
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:24,667
Now I write daily blogs aboutmy children.

1617
01:11:24,733 --> 01:11:25,900
Children?

1618
01:11:25,967 --> 01:11:28,133
Number two is on the way.

1619
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,100
Darling, today blogs begin atconception.

1620
01:11:33,133 --> 01:11:34,167
Mommy I gotta go.

1621
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:35,200
Not now.

1622
01:11:40,733 --> 01:11:42,600
Oh she's so cranky when she'steething.

1623
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:43,833
I had to go to the doctor toget some Xanax

1624
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,533
just to get through it.

1625
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,900
It's your other daddy!

1626
01:11:54,967 --> 01:11:56,133
Hey...

1627
01:11:57,433 --> 01:11:58,600
Hey Matt.

1628
01:11:58,667 --> 01:11:59,900
How are you doing?

1629
01:12:04,267 --> 01:12:05,467
Where is my big boy?

1630
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:07,033
Come here!

1631
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,567
Oh, you okay?

1632
01:12:09,633 --> 01:12:10,700
We're fine.

1633
01:12:10,767 --> 01:12:11,767
I'm Markus.

1634
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,667
Oh Markus I'm Jenny.

1635
01:12:13,733 --> 01:12:16,533
This is Riley's boyfriend, Imean partner.

1636
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,933
I never know what to say.

1637
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,333
We never know either.

1638
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,633
Husband, actually.

1639
01:12:21,867 --> 01:12:23,900
Markus is my husband.

1640
01:12:23,967 --> 01:12:26,833
Husband, husband, husband

1641
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,967
I want these personallydelivered

1642
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:38,767
to 77 7th Avenue

1643
01:12:42,433 --> 01:12:44,567
My boyfriend bought it for me.

1644
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,333
No.

1645
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,367
What?

1646
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:51,800
What's so goddamned funny?

1647
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,100
Well, I'm notlaughing with you .

1648
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:59,600
What have you manifested?

1649
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,067
He's in your office.

1650
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:07,333
Donna!

1651
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,867
Boss?

1652
01:13:08,933 --> 01:13:09,933
I finally found the inspiration

1653
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,867
for my fall line:

1654
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:14,000
Bedouin tents.

1655
01:13:14,067 --> 01:13:15,800
Yeah?

1656
01:13:15,867 --> 01:13:18,600
I understand they'remildew-resistant.

1657
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:21,800
Is it that hideous?

1658
01:13:21,867 --> 01:13:23,933
It's just... not you, is all.

1659
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:26,533
Well,

1660
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,433
Vern likes me this way

1661
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,000
I'm gonna pretend like I didn'thear that.

1662
01:13:31,067 --> 01:13:32,833
I know what you're thinking.

1663
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,267
Yeah, probably.

1664
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,467
What if I wanna get married

1665
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:37,267
and move far, far away?

1666
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,267
What?

1667
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,167
Audrey did it.

1668
01:13:41,233 --> 01:13:43,400
And I can only assume she'svery happy.

1669
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:45,167
You're not Audrey.

1670
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:47,633
I turned 40 this year, Riley.40!

1671
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,300
Iâ€™m like the oldest living faghag.

1672
01:13:49,367 --> 01:13:50,633
Vern...

1673
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:51,567
Vern might be my last chance

1674
01:13:51,633 --> 01:13:53,133
to settle down.

1675
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,500
Settle just about sums it up

1676
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:58,133
You are not a woman.

1677
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:58,967
You do not know the pressures

1678
01:13:59,033 --> 01:14:00,133
I know you!

1679
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,533
So?

1680
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,300
So youâ€™ve never covered up.

1681
01:14:03,367 --> 01:14:04,800
Youâ€™ve never ignored yourfriends.

1682
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:06,600
And you told me tokill you dea d

1683
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:07,767
if you ever, ever changed for aman.

1684
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,433
You told me to kill you

1685
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,467
if ever, ever you changed for aman.

1686
01:14:11,533 --> 01:14:12,567
How have I...?

1687
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,967
Sure it's just the dog beinghousebroken?

1688
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,033
Okay.

1689
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,133
Okay?

1690
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,333
Okay.

1691
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,867
-You wanna be an asshole?-I'm the asshole?

1692
01:14:23,933 --> 01:14:25,967
Get over there. Yes, you're theasshole.

1693
01:14:26,033 --> 01:14:27,000
Ah fuck you.

1694
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:28,367
Fuck you!

1695
01:14:28,433 --> 01:14:29,667
Yeah, roll the parachute up.

1696
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:31,100
Should we check with Vern?

1697
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:32,400
You know I'm wearing the dress,

1698
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:34,033
but I also got the balls.

1699
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,467
Oh that's fine with mebecause...

1700
01:14:35,533 --> 01:14:36,600
You wanna go check with Baby?

1701
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,200
Oh, you're on my hair!

1702
01:14:46,267 --> 01:14:47,333
Oww! No biting!

1703
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,367
Ouch!

1704
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,500
Aww! You hit me.

1705
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,467
Bradleigh wants the camera.

1706
01:14:59,933 --> 01:15:02,000
Okay.. that was fucking hot.

1707
01:15:11,267 --> 01:15:12,267
It'd be an honor to model foryour ad

1708
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:13,633
campaign Bradleigh.

1709
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:15,900
It's Brad- LAY

1710
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:17,467
Oh, Brad-LAY sorry.

1711
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,600
That Marc Jacobs ad was shot inMaine.

1712
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:24,033
Ocean was so icy

1713
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,000
my junk shriveled right up!

1714
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,967
You're new to the city I takeit?

1715
01:15:30,033 --> 01:15:31,767
Just got in last Friday.

1716
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,833
We're gonna take a quick photo.

1717
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:35,933
Hi, I'm Violet.

1718
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,700
Oh, hi I'm Cyd.

1719
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:41,400
But call me J-Flame...everybody does.

1720
01:15:41,467 --> 01:15:42,433
J-Flame?

1721
01:15:45,033 --> 01:15:46,333
I just realized I don't haveanything

1722
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,667
that will fit you.

1723
01:15:47,733 --> 01:15:50,267
Oh, everything fits me.

1724
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:50,967
I'm sample size.

1725
01:15:51,033 --> 01:15:52,067
True.

1726
01:15:52,133 --> 01:15:54,367
You got a great look.

1727
01:15:54,433 --> 01:15:57,233
I could use the color in my adcampaign...

1728
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,233
or sprawled on my chinchillarug.

1729
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,500
So lamentably the truth isyou're just too

1730
01:16:02,567 --> 01:16:04,733
swishy to model for Bradleigh.

1731
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,233
Swishy?

1732
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,600
Swishy.

1733
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,400
But modeling only has to dowith how I look

1734
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:15,100
Who told you that?

1735
01:16:24,433 --> 01:16:25,600
What?

1736
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,467
Go do an email blast.

1737
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:54,967
When you told me last night youloved me...

1738
01:16:55,033 --> 01:16:56,133
Did you mean it?

1739
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,067
Where the hell have you been?

1740
01:17:01,133 --> 01:17:02,067
I haven't seen you in like aweek.

1741
01:17:02,133 --> 01:17:03,467
I have huge news.

1742
01:17:03,533 --> 01:17:04,600
What the hell are you wearing?

1743
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:05,733
Vern took me shopping.

1744
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,600
Okay. Was he the Vern?

1745
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:08,700
Yes, but you know after your

1746
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:10,567
rude interruption

1747
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:12,233
we spent the most amazing weektogether.

1748
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,600
And I'm not gonna say anythingelse

1749
01:17:13,667 --> 01:17:14,933
because I don't wanna jinx it.

1750
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,667
Hello naked boy in my house.

1751
01:17:15,733 --> 01:17:16,700
I'm Andre.

1752
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,100
I'm gonna go grab another cupof coffee.

1753
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,733
Anybody else want?

1754
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,767
No, thanks.

1755
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:25,600
He won't leave.

1756
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:26,567
You might soon be in the marketfor

1757
01:17:26,633 --> 01:17:28,333
a new roommate.

1758
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,767
What do you mean? You're notleaving.

1759
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:30,967
Things are movingkinda quickly .

1760
01:17:31,033 --> 01:17:32,900
I haven't even met Vern.

1761
01:17:32,967 --> 01:17:34,767
I think that's why they aregoing so great.

1762
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,000
I also happen to know thatyou're keeping

1763
01:17:36,067 --> 01:17:37,900
him from Markus and Riley.

1764
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:39,600
How can you be nesting withsomeone who

1765
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:41,067
doesn't even know your bestfriends?

1766
01:17:41,133 --> 01:17:42,967
How could he possibly know you?

1767
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,533
What's your huge news?

1768
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,100
I found your fag stag.

1769
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:48,800
Fine as fine can be...

1770
01:17:48,867 --> 01:17:50,867
and honey, he is into you.

1771
01:17:50,933 --> 01:17:51,967
I know him?

1772
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:52,967
Yes!

1773
01:17:53,033 --> 01:17:54,000
Who?

1774
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,033
When am I meeting Vern?

1775
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,867
You are not.

1776
01:17:57,933 --> 01:17:59,400
Okay, are you ashamed of yourfriends?

1777
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,633
Or you ashamed of yourself, ha?

1778
01:18:02,767 --> 01:18:04,000
I could live here.

1779
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:07,133
Oh boy.

1780
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:10,867
Oh Saturday afternoon is great.

1781
01:18:10,933 --> 01:18:12,400
Oh, I don't know.

1782
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,533
What about you?

1783
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:24,333
I'd really like to go toCentral Park.

1784
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,533
We could stroll through therambles...

1785
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,067
picnic at Cherry Hill

1786
01:18:30,467 --> 01:18:32,367
gaze at the Dakota? Mmm hmm

1787
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,000
I prefer to wait for the light.

1788
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:40,400
There's no traffic.

1789
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,267
There's no traffic!

1790
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,300
It's one of the ways I practicepatience.

1791
01:18:44,367 --> 01:18:45,767
Oh for Pete's sake.

1792
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:48,833
What are you gonna do with me?

1793
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,167
Practice patience.

1794
01:19:20,467 --> 01:19:22,433
Lot of men checking you out.

1795
01:19:27,433 --> 01:19:28,700
Oh hi Violet!

1796
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,667
Women, too. Are you famous?

1797
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,733
Look. Gargoyle!

1798
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,400
What in the world is going onhere?

1799
01:19:40,467 --> 01:19:43,933
I totally forgot that this lawnis a...

1800
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,967
boy-hive.

1801
01:19:46,733 --> 01:19:47,600
Vern, I am afraid thatsomething is

1802
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:48,800
about to go down

1803
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,633
and I need to tell you.

1804
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:51,867
What is it? You can tell meanything.

1805
01:19:51,933 --> 01:19:53,400
Remember my roommate?

1806
01:19:53,467 --> 01:19:55,600
I was blindfolded at the time.

1807
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:57,433
He's just the tip of...you kno w

1808
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,167
all my life I've been a fruitfly.

1809
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:00,267
What?

1810
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:01,833
Fag hag? Queen mother?

1811
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,267
Every last man in my life isgay.

1812
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:04,300
We'll get through this.

1813
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:05,433
Vernon, run!

1814
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,467
No, wait!

1815
01:20:07,633 --> 01:20:08,767
What is going on here?

1816
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:09,900
This is an intervention.

1817
01:20:09,967 --> 01:20:11,367
Just give me a minute.

1818
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:12,433
No, please. We wanthim to stay .

1819
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,433
Who are you people?

1820
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,433
We're her friends

1821
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,633
More than friends.

1822
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,600
In a totally not sexual way,but

1823
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:20,967
This is us at our first pride,remember that?

1824
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:22,867
You've always beenunconditional...

1825
01:20:22,933 --> 01:20:24,400
and we support you no matter

1826
01:20:24,467 --> 01:20:26,200
who you choose to love.

1827
01:20:26,267 --> 01:20:27,433
But your heterosexuality ishurting us

1828
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,033
in the following ways:

1829
01:20:30,733 --> 01:20:32,333
Since you met Vern it feelslike you're

1830
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,267
becoming someone who's notViolet.

1831
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:35,767
How dare you say I'm not goodfor Violet.

1832
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:37,833
Honestly, it's not about you.

1833
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,967
It's about her.

1834
01:20:46,867 --> 01:20:47,867
Vern, no.

1835
01:20:47,933 --> 01:20:49,267
Wait!

1836
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,967
I haven't even read mine yet.

1837
01:20:51,033 --> 01:20:53,000
We just wanna be part of yourlife.

1838
01:20:53,067 --> 01:20:54,967
I knew this was a bad idea.

1839
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,800
Free hugs!

1840
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:42,667
Free hugs!

1841
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:45,333
Free hug.

1842
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,300
What?!?

1843
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:19,200
You know surrogates are reallyhard

1844
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,233
to come by.

1845
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,667
Yes And expensive.

1846
01:22:22,733 --> 01:22:24,567
The best deal is this agency inIndia.

1847
01:22:24,633 --> 01:22:25,667
Really?

1848
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:27,467
Yeah.

1849
01:22:27,533 --> 01:22:28,767
You give them 20 grand, flydown there

1850
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,000
with the egg and the sperm

1851
01:22:30,067 --> 01:22:31,233
9 months later fly back

1852
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,033
and pick up your newborn.

1853
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:35,233
Can't they just Fed-Ex the babyback?

1854
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,600
Well, Riley and I were thinkingabout

1855
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:39,033
going the Polynesian route.

1856
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,867
You know Peter and I are gonnado that for our next one.

1857
01:22:40,933 --> 01:22:42,300
You two shouldreally look into .

1858
01:22:42,367 --> 01:22:44,000
You might get a two-for-onespecial.

1859
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:45,033
Oh yeah.

1860
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,867
Are you okay, sweetie?

1861
01:23:00,933 --> 01:23:01,900
Are you okay?

1862
01:23:02,933 --> 01:23:04,033
What's going on?

1863
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,367
You alright?

1864
01:23:06,433 --> 01:23:07,567
Just breathe.

1865
01:23:07,633 --> 01:23:09,300
Like Lamaze breathing...

1866
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,367
like that.

1867
01:23:17,733 --> 01:23:20,433
Maybe we should have heard themout.

1868
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,633
Why?

1869
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,233
We have each other now.

1870
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,400
My friends arenâ€™t placeholders.

1871
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:28,600
I'm not sure I like yourfriends.

1872
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:29,700
You're gonna have to give them

1873
01:23:29,767 --> 01:23:31,633
another shot.

1874
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,267
Seems like you don't like themmuch either.

1875
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:36,767
Well, you're wrong.I love them .

1876
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,567
Remember what you said?

1877
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:40,367
They are who matters...

1878
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:41,433
to me.

1879
01:23:43,367 --> 01:23:45,000
Well, that's a shame because Ithought

1880
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:46,100
I'd be the one that mattered toyou.

1881
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:47,700
Well of course you do.

1882
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:51,833
I've got a proposal for you.

1883
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:55,933
These are the renovations to my

1884
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,100
homestead in Idaho.

1885
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:58,567
Outside Idaho Falls.

1886
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:02,233
I hired a contractor and Iwanted you to see

1887
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,900
the plans to see if youapproved.

1888
01:24:04,967 --> 01:24:06,033
It's a Victorian...

1889
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,200
lots of acreage,

1890
01:24:07,267 --> 01:24:08,667
fresh air.

1891
01:24:08,733 --> 01:24:09,867
Aren't your parentsstill there ?

1892
01:24:09,933 --> 01:24:10,867
It's 5000 square feet...

1893
01:24:10,933 --> 01:24:12,100
and my folks...

1894
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:13,567
my folks would adore you.

1895
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:15,367
Look... here's my dad.

1896
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,667
I'm sure I'd love them.

1897
01:24:19,733 --> 01:24:22,000
I just don't know if this isthe life for Violet

1898
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:24,000
And I got plane tickets.

1899
01:24:24,067 --> 01:24:26,400
for the end of November.

1900
01:24:26,467 --> 01:24:27,900
You got plane tickets?

1901
01:24:27,967 --> 01:24:28,967
You didn't ask me.

1902
01:24:29,033 --> 01:24:30,267
Will you go?

1903
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:31,667
Well, I'm going to Taiwan

1904
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,233
with Bradleigh in November.

1905
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,467
I'm sure they'll let you offwork

1906
01:24:34,533 --> 01:24:35,467
It's only couple of weeks

1907
01:24:35,533 --> 01:24:36,900
and if they don't...

1908
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,700
I make enough for two.

1909
01:24:39,767 --> 01:24:41,167
I'd like the faÃ§ade to stayoriginal

1910
01:24:41,233 --> 01:24:42,633
you know how sentimental I am

1911
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,633
about architecture

1912
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,833
but the interior needs to betotally gutted.

1913
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:47,933
You have this whole thingworked out,

1914
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,967
don't you?

1915
01:24:51,067 --> 01:24:53,333
They are just plans. They canchange.

1916
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,100
What about my life here?

1917
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:58,000
We'd start a whole new life.

1918
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:01,300
Why in the world would I wannado that?

1919
01:25:01,367 --> 01:25:02,767
Idaho?

1920
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,667
You're kidding?

1921
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:06,700
There's like one decent gay barin Idaho.

1922
01:25:06,767 --> 01:25:07,800
What are you saying Violet?

1923
01:25:07,867 --> 01:25:08,967
You're scaring me

1924
01:25:09,033 --> 01:25:11,100
And it's in Pocatello!

1925
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:13,033
I'm not a simple girl.

1926
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:15,167
I'm a complex, subversive woman

1927
01:25:15,233 --> 01:25:18,267
and I can't pretend anymorethat I'm not.

1928
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:21,133
Vern, I have totallymisrepresented myself.

1929
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,767
Stop. What did I do?

1930
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,500
What did I say?

1931
01:25:24,567 --> 01:25:25,767
Nothing.

1932
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:27,600
Sweet Vern, I'm so sorry.

1933
01:25:29,967 --> 01:25:32,833
It's not you... it's me.

1934
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:50,000
I love you.

1935
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,400
What did you just say?

1936
01:25:53,467 --> 01:25:54,733
I said I love you.

1937
01:25:58,433 --> 01:25:59,600
What's my name?

1938
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:00,667
I am so in love with you.

1939
01:26:00,733 --> 01:26:01,700
Okay

1940
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,733
I think you need to go.

1941
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,833
But I love you.

1942
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,867
Yeah.

1943
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:10,333
You gotta go.

1944
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,333
Hello?

1945
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,133
I'm sorry I couldn't tell youbefore but I love you

1946
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,933
Do you hear me?

1947
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:03,967
Me too.

1948
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:07,633
And I know sucking every lastcock in

1949
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:09,467
the city is not the best way toshow you

1950
01:27:09,533 --> 01:27:10,767
but I am madly in love with youDarian.

1951
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:11,967
It's Dad.

1952
01:27:12,033 --> 01:27:13,233
What?

1953
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,633
Luke, this is your father.

1954
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,400
Oh my god, wrong number.

1955
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:26,667
You have 473 newFrisky Friends .

1956
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,267
I love you.

1957
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:17,467
I feel like I'm stuck inA Small World.

1958
01:28:17,533 --> 01:28:19,433
Hostage on a boat with allthose little

1959
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,767
Dutch kids singing

1960
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:22,800
Okay.

1961
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,600
I hate this ride.

1962
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,333
Then let's get off it for awhile.

1963
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,600
There are other rides, you know

1964
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:30,300
I know Riley...

1965
01:28:30,367 --> 01:28:31,967
I know.

1966
01:28:32,033 --> 01:28:33,300
We don't have to keep goinground

1967
01:28:33,367 --> 01:28:35,033
and round on the same old one.

1968
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:37,633
No, no we don't. We can have itall.

1969
01:28:40,267 --> 01:28:43,367
Now if you'd just get out ofthe playpen

1970
01:28:56,367 --> 01:28:59,433
So, what'd you really thinkabout Vern?

1971
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,333
I wouldn't kick him out of bed.

1972
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,500
That's not saying a whole lot.

1973
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,500
Oh my gosh, did you hear whathappened

1974
01:29:09,567 --> 01:29:11,867
last night between Riley andMarkus?

1975
01:29:11,933 --> 01:29:13,067
No.

1976
01:29:13,133 --> 01:29:14,933
I got the craziest text.

1977
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,767
What now?

1978
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:18,700
We'll just wait and look at iton the

1979
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:20,133
blog but you know

1980
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,633
same old, same old.

1981
01:29:22,867 --> 01:29:24,067
Wow.

1982
01:29:24,133 --> 01:29:26,600
How long have those two beentogether?

1983
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:28,700
I don't know, like 50 years.

1984
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:35,500
Yesterday was a disaster on allcounts.

1985
01:29:38,633 --> 01:29:41,500
Hey, do you ever just think ofjust like,

1986
01:29:41,567 --> 01:29:43,467
I don't know quittingeverything and

1987
01:29:43,533 --> 01:29:44,800
going back to school orsomething?

1988
01:29:44,867 --> 01:29:46,367
School? What would we study?

1989
01:29:46,433 --> 01:29:47,633
You mean like choose a major?

1990
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,167
Yeah, choose a major.

1991
01:29:52,733 --> 01:29:54,200
I'm still undecided.

1992
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:57,267
Me too.

1993
01:30:00,233 --> 01:30:02,467
Pull out all the stops. I wantthe works.

1994
01:30:02,533 --> 01:30:04,233
You got it.

1995
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,000
I'm working Luke's sex partytonight

1996
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,767
and this weekend is mydebutante ball

1997
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:09,333
where I will be formallyreintroduced

1998
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,967
into gay society.

1999
01:30:11,033 --> 01:30:12,033
You're coming right?

2000
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,067
Absolutely.

2001
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:16,567
How is Luke?

2002
01:30:16,633 --> 01:30:17,967
He's fine.

2003
01:30:20,133 --> 01:30:22,200
He drunk dialed his dad.

2004
01:30:22,267 --> 01:30:23,533
Sounds right.

2005
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,500
He meant to drunk dial you.

2006
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,900
If only he wasn't so stubborn,

2007
01:30:27,967 --> 01:30:29,733
so sarcastic.

2008
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,333
Luke has his problems.

2009
01:30:32,533 --> 01:30:33,933
He's so infuriating.

2010
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,467
And yet...

2011
01:30:38,567 --> 01:30:40,667
he's the only person I want towake up with.

2012
01:30:40,733 --> 01:30:42,600
I do not understand why twopeople who

2013
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:44,667
have so much in common

2014
01:30:44,733 --> 01:30:46,867
just wanna pick each otherapart all the time.

2015
01:30:46,933 --> 01:30:48,967
You're gonna end up two bitterold queens

2016
01:30:49,033 --> 01:30:52,500
and lord knows we've enough ofthose.

2017
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:55,533
Does this necklace make me lookfat?

2018
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:56,733
Oh come on. I've missed you.

2019
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,300
-I missed you too.-Alright.

2020
01:30:58,367 --> 01:31:00,000
Does it make melook fat though?

2021
01:31:00,067 --> 01:31:01,067
No.

2022
01:31:01,133 --> 01:31:02,100
