34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,800
Hi! I'm Adam.

35
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,733
And I'm his husband, Steven.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,733
And this is our story.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
In the beginning,

38
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,300
God created the Heavensand the Earth.

39
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,300
Wait a minute!

40
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,433

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,100
Sorry.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,333
In the beginning,

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
God was... bored.

44
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,333
He was all alonein the universe,

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,533
and the thought of being aloneforever bothered Him.

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,033
He realized what he neededwere beautiful beingsto entertain Him.

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,500
So, God created the angels.

48
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,400
And they were hot.

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,533
Each angel was hotand sexy

51
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,200
God loved the angels,

00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,433
but soon realizedthat He wanted more.

53
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,300

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,300
Thanks.

330
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,733
I'm just here to relax.

331
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I can help with that.

332
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,933
I'm actually seeing someone.

333
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,700
I'm not gonna tell him.

334
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,533
I'm not here to hook up.

335
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,633
C'mon,just let me suck you off.

336
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,233
No!

337
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,600
Just leave me the fuck alone.

338
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,600
I tried to be nice but Christ!

339
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,000
Dick.

340
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,033
Can I talk to you aboutsomething?

341
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,400
-Sure, what is it?-My parents are comingto opening night.

342
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,933
-That's great!-It is. I mean they've alwaysbeen so supportive,

343
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,633
but I never expected them tocome all the way for this.

344
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,600
It is your first New Yorkopening. You shouldn'tbe surprised.

345
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,100
I know, but my parentsare very religious.

346
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,900
Oh, so do your parents knowwhat the show is about?

347
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,733
I told them it was "Adam andEve - The Way God Made 'Em".

348
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,100
Yeah, there gonna be surprised.

349
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,000
And they don't knowabout me either.

350
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,367
This is gonna be good.

351
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,833
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm serious.I'm freaking out.

353
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,900
They wouldn't let usread Harry Potter,

354
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,000
because it was all magicand against God.

355
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,133
Well if they think HarryPotter is sacrilegious,

356
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,133
I cant wait to hear theirreview of this show.

357
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,433
I try to be good, Idon't have sex...

358
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,900
But you've had sex right?

359
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,133
What?Seriously?

360
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,533
I wanted to wait forthe right guy.

361
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,833
But I don't really go out andmeet people so I neverreally found one.

362
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,000
Wow. But haven't youever been curious?

363
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,833
No.

364
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,033
Yes.I don't know. Look!

365
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,633
Sex is the last thingon my mind right now.What am I gonna do?

366
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,300
I wish I knew what to tell you.

367
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:47,100
My parents are gonna hate me.

368
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,100
No they're not.It's all gonna be OK.Trust me.

369
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:51,133
Look, we gotta go.We'll talk later?

370
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,133
Yeah.

371
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,000
Ok.

372
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:57,133
God I wish this wasn'thappening.

373
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,433
And just as the propheciesforetold, five thousandyears later,

374
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,933
God put Adam and Steveback on the Earth to provetheir love was real,

375
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,700
and able to beat the obstaclesof the modern world.

376
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:09,233
They were put indifferent places,

377
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,333
and in homes that used theBreeders Informational Bookof Living Examples.

It is time to hear about Jesus!

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,233
-Amen!-But before...

425
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,833
I can tell y'all aboutthe word of the Lord,

426
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,133
I need to talk to you aboutsomething very important.

427
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,500
My friends, partnersin my ministry,

428
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:23,333
we have fallen on hard times.

429
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Now, we want to express acrossthe world our message,

430
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,533
but, we are runningout of money!

431
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,933
Now you know all themoney in your wallets

432
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,133
and in your bank accountsand on your credit cards,

433
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,833
well, that is not your money!

434
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,300
That is God's money,

435
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,633
and God needs his money back!

436
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,833
Hallelujah!

437
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,833
And then last thing, justat the end of "creation"

438
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,933
I want a sforzandoon the "aah",

439
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,733
so just watch me, it willbe like "aaaaahh!"

440
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,933
Like that, yeah?

441
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,100
Yes.

442
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,433
Thank you so much.

443
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,633
Have a good second act.

444
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,500
Thank you.

445
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
So, what do you thinkI should do?

446
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,300
About what? Your parentsor your virginity?

447
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:07,133
What? Huh? What?You're a vir...

448
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,633
You'll have to excuse her.She's never had to usethat word before.

449
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,833
That is not true.I used to pray to Maryand she was a vir-

450
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,900
-Are you really a virgin?-This probably wasn't the bestplace for this conversation.

451
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,633
We can help you outwith your virginity.

452
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,833
Oh, no you can't.Leave him alone.

453
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,200
I didn't mean it like that.I meant come outwith us tonight.

454
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:28,700
We know a lot of hot boys.We can get you laid.

455
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,933
-Come out with us!-I'm not trying to get laid.

456
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
Going out tonight might begood for you. Take yourmind off things.

457
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:36,900
Give you a chance toclear your head.

458
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:39,200
And Sebastian and I will bethere to make surethese whores

459
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,633
don't put you on an expresstrain to hell.

460
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,800
Are you calling me a whore?

461
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:46,133
If I wasn't sitting in thischair right now, I'dtake my...

462
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,300
But you are, Blanche!You are!

463
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,867
To alcohol!

464
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,833
Go-go dancing. I couldn'timagine doing that.

465
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,633
Is he for real?Red panties.

466
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,500
I know, he has a zit onhis right butt cheek.

467
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,533
Alright, let's get him another.

468
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,900
-I'll be right back.-Okay.

469
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,933
Hey! Hey you!How you doing?

470
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,233
I've never been better.This was such a good idea.

471
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,600
Are you sure?You seem pretty wasted.

472
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:49,033
You can call it "wasted',I call it "free!"

473
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,800
Okay, just don't doanything stupid.

474
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:07,700
I'll show you guys dancing.

475
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,100
What is this?

476
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:14,367
No, no, no, no.

477
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,167
Alright, I am so overyou and your friends.

478
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Oh my God.

479
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,867
So good!Don't knock yourself out.

480
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,800
I think this is yours.

481
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,500
I have no idea how itended up off of me.

482
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:11,733
May I help youput it back on?

483
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,833
You can help me do anything.

484
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,733
Oh really?

485
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,700
Yeah.

486

Not in front of my friends.

487
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300

488
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:29,800
We can't kiss in frontof my friends.

489
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:31,233
You know you kissed me right?

490
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,400
Yeah, I know, but

491
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:35,367
we can't do this infront of my friends.

492
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,300
Do you want to go somewhere?

493
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:47,933
I've always wantedto go to Paris.

494
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,533
Well, for tonight,lets go to my place.

495
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,367
That will do for now.

496
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,900
Hey hold this,I'll be right back.

497
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,433
Hey Eddie!

498
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,233
-Can I talk to you a minute?-Sure, what's up?

499
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,033
Are you sure you knowwhat you're doing?

500
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,633
Yeah, why?

501
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,533
I just want to make sure.

502
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,733
You and your newfound freedom.

503
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,733
You don't have to gohome with anyone.

504
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,267
Yeah I know.

505
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,933
I wanna go home with him.

506
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
He's really hot.

507
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:32,600
Okay.

508
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:36,333
I appreciate it.Goodnight.

509
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,500
-Be safe.-Uh huh.

510
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,300
I've never done this before.

511
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,600
Just relax.

512
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:08,100
Doesn't this feel good?

513
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,167
Yes.

514
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,633
Wait, shouldn't we get a con...

515
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Don't worry about it.

516
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:29,233
Do you do this a lot?

517
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,067
No, you're special.

518
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,000
-So, what happenedto you last night?-What do you mean?

519
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:42,533
Well, first you were drunk, andthen you were with that guy...

520
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,733
-Scott?-Scott.

521
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,900
Did you do it?Did you tap his little ass?

522
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:50,300
Well, he actually...

523
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,233
-No!-What?

524
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,433
You bottomed for a bottom?

525
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,433
I don't even know whatto say to that.

526
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,533
-But you were safe, right?-What?

527
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,733
-You were safe, right?-Safe?

528
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,800
When you had sex, youused a condom?

529
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:08,733
He doesn't have sex a lot.He said it wouldhurt more if...

530
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,233
Are you serious?He's a slut!

531
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,033
Don't you ever haveunsafe sex again, you hear me?

532
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,133
Never! I don't carewho you're with.

533
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,133
You just met him, that's crazy!

534
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,400
-But he...-Never have unsafe sex!

535
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,533
Ok?

536
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Yes.Fine.

537
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,133
Five minutes guys!

538
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,533
Thanks five.

539
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,100
So, what should I doabout my parents?

540
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,433
Well, whatever you do, don'ttell them a bottom bangedyou bareback.

541
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,100
I'm serious!

542
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,333
Look, whatever you do, whateveryou tell them, just...

543
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,833
make sure you do itbefore they get here.

544
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,600
[text signal]

545
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:46,933
What the hell?

546
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,200
What's wrong?

547
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,500
Someone told Sebastianthat I was HIV positive.

548
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:58,700
Oh, that makes sensenow, all the safe stuff.

549
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,500
-I'm so sorry, I didn't...-I'm not!

550
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,467
I'm not positive!

551
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:08,500
Benny, you know whatI think it's time for?

552
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,700
I think it's time to tell allour Christian friends

553
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:14,900
just what's going on in ourown family right now.

554
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:17,100
Are you sure you're upfor it, Sugar Plum?

555
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,233
I'm strong.

556
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,233
Strong.

557
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,433
For Jesus!

558
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,567
That's my Patty!

559
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,733
I'm not sure if y'allknow this or not,

560
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,833
but one of our very own singingangels is my nephew, Steven.

561
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,000
My sister became a Catholicfor her husband,

562
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:40,033
and they have beenraising Steven

563
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,300
as a Catholic!-Oh Lord.

564
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,300
Jesus just told me howmuch that hurt Him!

565
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,200
Now, a couple of weeks ago,Steven came to meand he said,

566
00:32:55,267 --> 00:33:00,233
"Aunt Patty, I think there'ssomething you need to know."

567
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,700
Well, I clutched myheart and I said

568
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:06,633
"Please, dear Jesus. Let himtell me he's leaving theCatholic Church!"

569
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Praise Jesus!

570
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,400
But no, he said, "Aunt Patty,

571
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:18,033
I am a hhh...homosexual."-Homosexual!

572
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,833
Well, I fell to my knees and Isaid, "No Jesus! No!He's become a priest!"

573
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,900
Oh no!

574
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,733
Well, thank Jesus, hewas not a priest.

575
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,400
But he was a hh...homosexual.

576
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:35,733
But at least that's a diseasewe can cure him of.

577
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,833
Well, Benny and Italked to him,

578
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,900
and we read him parts ofthe Bible where it sayshomosexuality is wrong.

579
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,300
God hates them.

580
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,233
Hates them!

581
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,633
And then, Jesus gaveme my mission.

582
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,633
And Benny and I togetherstarted a retreat program

583
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,533
to help those young homosexualson the straight path to Jesus!

584
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,933
-Good Lord!-To scare that demon ofhomosexuality out of them!

585
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,233
-Praise Jesus!-And we found a wonderfulrecovered homosexual

586
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,033
named Bruce Cohan,

587
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,533
not Cohen.

588
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,433
And he used to bea choreographeron the Broadway

589
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,300
until he found Jesus.-Yes indeed!

590
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:25,733
-And he will lead that retreat!-Yes Lord!

591
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,433
Now part of yourdonations today

592
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,800
will go towards the "FoundationAgainst Gayness Society."

593
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:39,333
Now, here's our nephew,the reformed Catholic,

594
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,633
and soon to bereformed homosexual,-Praise Lord!

595
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,967
Steven, to give his testimony.

596
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,267
-Praise Jesus.-Praise Jesus.

597
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,933
This whole situation has beenvery difficult for me.

598
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,533
You see,

599
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,633
I love the Lord,

600
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,700
but, I know He doesn't love me.

601
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,633
I know He doesn't wantme to be gay.

-I'm negative.-Of course.

696
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:49,500
But no matter how safe you are,those tests are just sonerve-wracking.

697
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,933
What did Sebastian say when youtold him you were tested?

698
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,133
Nothing. He hasn't evencalled me back yet.

699
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,533
He's an asshole.

700
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,333
No, he's just confused.

701
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,500
No, he's an asshole. You atleast deserve a phone call.

or someone to spendmy life with,

704
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,633
but I always end upgetting fucked.And not in a good way.

705
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,633
That's why I don't do thelove thing anymore.It get's too complicated.

706

But I want sex to be special -to mean something.

But why?

721
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,600
Imagine if you wentto a theme parkand walked around

722
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,633
until you found the perfectrollercoaster.

723
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,133
By the time you pickedthe right one, the parkwould be closed,

724
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,633
and you wouldn't have gottento enjoy anything.

725
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,233
Sometimes you should justshut up and enjoy the ride.

726
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,100

727

884
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,600

888
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,633
But don't try anything.

889
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,667

00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,700
Sure.

977
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,600
So, tell me about yourself.

978
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:08,600
Sure.

979
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:13,733
What would you like to know?

980
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,333
Where are you from?Why do you do this?

981
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,833
Well, I'm from Washington.Seattle, actually.

982
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:28,333
I go to NYU. And thisis how I pay for it.

983
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,233
Nothing crazy or anything.

984
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,300
Does your family knowyou do this?

985
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:35,033
No.They do know I'm gay though.

986
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,800
Are you seeing anyone?

987
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:38,033
Yes.

988
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,767
Does he know?

989
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,967
How would you like a massage?

990
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,200
Sure.

991
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:05,433
Isn't this whole thingstrange for you?

992
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,200
It was... at first.

993
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:13,333
And you probably end upsleeping with fat old men.

994
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,967
Sometimes I get to sleep withhot young guys like you.

995
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:23,333
Do you sleep with hotyoung guys a lot?

996
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,100
A lot of young guys justdon't wanna deal withdating or meeting anyone.

997
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:32,933
And with me there isno drama, you know?

998
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,533
No bitching, no nagging.And what you see iswhat you get.

999
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,933
I don't care if you wantme to top or...

1000
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,967
if you want to fuckthe shit out of me.

1001
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,300
Do you kiss all your clients?

1002
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,200
Only the ones I want to.

1003
00:59:51,267 --> 00:59:53,300
Can I ask you a question?

1004
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,933
You sure are full of questions.

1005
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,067
I know this is strange but...

1006
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,900
can I hold you?

1007
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:10,300

I didn't realize youwere working here.

1018
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:10,400
I'm not having a good day.

1019
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:11,533
You wanna talk?

1020
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,900
Yeah.

1021
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:14,267
Let's go downstairs.

1022
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,333
What's wrong?

1023
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,533
I told my parents.

1024
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,533
-Did you tell them everything?-Yeah.

1025
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,833
It didn't go well.

1026
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,333
What did they say?

1027
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,667
Nothing.

1028
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,333
They always say they loveme and they said nothing.

1029
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,833
I think my mom started crying.

1030
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,333
I could almost hear theirdisappointment,

1031
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,600
hear their hearts break.

1032
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,733
They hate me.-They don't hate you.

1033
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,033
It's tough for parentsto hear their kids aregay. It just takes time.

1034
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,700
I can't imagine being anythingworse than gay.-Don't say that.

1035
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:01,733
It's all going to beOK, you'll see.

1036
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,600
No, it's not Paul.

1037
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:08,233
You always say everything'sgoing to be OK, but it's not.

1038
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,233
Sometimes its goingto be horrible.

1039
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,133
Sometimes things turnout to be disasters.

1040
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,733
You don't know what it's liketo have your parents hate you.

1041
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,733
You don't know what it's liketo disappoint the peoplewho raised you,

1042
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,400
and gave you everything.You don't know!

1043
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,500
I just wish there was a cure.

1044
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,533
Something I could taketo make me normal.

1045
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,400
Some pill.Some shot.

1046
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:37,600
You are normal Eddie. Why wouldyou wanna change who you are?

1047
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,900
You know what, you shouldgo see that show,

1048
01:03:41,967 --> 01:03:43,233
"Adam and Steve - Just theWay God Made 'Em."

1050
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,033
Yeah, I hear the guy playingAdam is a slut.

1051
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,833
I hear the guy who plays Stevejust popped his cherry.

1052
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,900
Paul,don't you ever justwanna fit in?

1053
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:57,233
No, I never try to fit in.

1054
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,633
Could you imagine if I triedto be like the people Igrew up around?

1055
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,800
I'd be watching professionalwrestling and drinkingbeer out of a can.

1056
01:04:04,867 --> 01:04:06,933
A can, Eddie!

1057
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,400
For a date I'd buy anice box of wine,

1058
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:13,633
drive to a parking lot tograb some girl's titties.

1059
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,900
I don't mind being different.

1060
01:04:15,967 --> 01:04:17,433
I like it.

1061
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,400
Because I know I'm better!

1062
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:21,400
This is me.

1063
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,533
Take it or leave it.

1064
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,400
How is being a slutgoing for you?

1065
01:04:26,467 --> 01:04:27,200
Not too well.

1066
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:30,033
I even hired a hustler.

1067
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,867
Really?Was it good?

1068
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:37,433
We cuddled.

1069
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,933
You hired a hustler and youjust cuddled with him?

1070
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,933
And you thought bottomingfor a bottom was pathetic.

1071
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,933
I know, Eddie.

1072
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,833
I'm just trying to figureout who I am.

1073
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,400
And sometimes, wheneveryone around you

1074
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:52,333
tells you you're supposedto be something else,

1075
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,933
you start to think you are.

1076
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,300
So you don't think youreally wanna be a slut?

1077
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,400
I just wanna be loved.

1078
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,400
Do you think my parentsstill love me?

1079
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,500
What do you think?

1080
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,767
You always make me feel better.

1081
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:14,600
It is gonna be OK.

so the last thing onmy mind is sex.

01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,233
but they want me tocome back in a few monthsto do it again.

-OK.-Oh, I can't leave yet.

1156
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,800
They want to take me back andgive me a counseling sessionin a few.

Teach me about safe sex.

No problem.I can wait.

Thank you so much forcoming with me.

1160
01:11:48,967 --> 01:11:51,200
I'm glad you're OK.

1161
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,500
So...

1162
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,900
I met a cute boy last night.

1163
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:01,033
Oh, me too!

1164
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,600
Mine sang me a song.

1165
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,100
Mine's a Mormon.

1166
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,567
I think we're both prettydamn pathetic.

1167
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,200
I think I like being pathetic.

1168
01:12:14,267 --> 01:12:17,200
Eddie, you wanna come back now?

1169
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,100
David?

1170
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,900
I can't believe we'redoing this.

1171
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:06,400
We said we weregoing to be here.

1172
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:08,833
We can't miss the biggestopening night of his life.

1173
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:14,033
Even if the whole showjust seems so wrong?

1174
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,900
I am just as troubled by allof this as you are,

1175
01:13:18,967 --> 01:13:21,167
but he's still our son.

1176
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,933
Hey everyone.

1177
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,733
Now remember Patty has a newsong at the end of the show.

1178
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,600
I can't believe they're addinga new song opening night.

1179
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:40,400
They don't call it off-Broadwayfor nothing.

1180
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,133
Ladies and gentlemen,welcome to opening night

1181
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,100
of "Adam and Steve - Justthe Way God Made'Em!"

1182
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:53,900
Before we begin, we mustinform you that thecoalition of Christians

1183
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:57,200
has rated our show "FLAMING."

1184
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:59,933
This doesn't mean we condoneor encourage thehomosexual lifestyle.

1185
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,600
It just means that ifyou enjoy our show,

1186
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:05,900
You'll end up burning inHell right next to us!

1187
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:14,333
God? If you're listening,we need some help!

1188
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,933
I'm frightened Adam,I'm frightened!

1189
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,033
We're lost in the woods andwe don't know where we'resupposed to be going.

1190
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,700
Hello!

1191
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,033
Are you a good witchor a bad witch?

1192
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,100
Why, I'm not a witch at all.

1193
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:35,333
I'm your guardian angel,Dorothy.

1194
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,100
An angel? Did God send youhere to bring us to Hell?

1195
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:43,733
No Dear. He sent me here tobring you to New York City.

1196
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,733
New York City is God'sfavorite city,

1197
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,967
but you can't go thereshirtless. Here!

1198
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,533
Wear these.

1199
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,433
Aren't they a little small?

1200
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,600
Trust me, Steve.It'll look divine!

1201
01:15:01,067 --> 01:15:03,067
These do look good.

1202
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,000
You look great.

1203
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:08,033
You too.

1204
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,333
Did you think I wouldsteer you wrong?

1205
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,700
After all, you're both friendsof Dorothy now.

1206
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:15,033
Can I ask you a question?

1207
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,700
Of course Steve.

1208
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,933

There are so many friendsof Dorothy here.

1260
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,867
You know what this journeyhas taught me?-What?

1261
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,900
That I want you inmy life forever.

1262
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,900
Steve?

1263
01:19:28,067 --> 01:19:29,233
Will you marry me?

1264
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,833
Of course I will.

1265
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:36,333
No, no, no! You can't do this.This is an abomination.

1266
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,333
The Lord God said that twomen should not sleep inthe same bed.

1267
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,633
It is Adam and Eve,not Adam and Steve.

1268
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,200
If God were here right now,what would He say?

1269
01:19:47,267 --> 01:19:49,000
Why don't you just ask me?

1270
01:19:49,067 --> 01:19:50,633
Who are you supposed to be?

1271
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,200
What did they expect? God!

1272
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:58,500
The Father.The man upstairs.

1273
01:19:58,567 --> 01:19:59,567
Watch this.

1274
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,267
Let there be darkness.

1275
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,800
I said LET THERE BE DARKNESS!

1276
01:20:06,867 --> 01:20:08,833
Now watch this -my favorite part.

1277
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,900
Why the fuck is it sodark down here?

1278
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:19,933
If you are God, then youknow it's Adam and Eve,not Adam and Steve.

1279
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,333
You shouldn't believeeverything you read.

1280
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,400
But your bookspecifically says...

1281
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,833
My book? Who saidit was my book?

1282
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:32,300
What do you think,I faxed it down here?

1283
01:20:32,367 --> 01:20:34,833
It was written by man.

1284
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,700
It was interpreted by man.

1285
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:40,533
It was abused by man.

1286
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,000
I never told peopleto hurt and kill.

1287
01:20:43,067 --> 01:20:44,700
I told everyone to love.

1288
01:20:44,767 --> 01:20:47,733
You mean, you love the gays?

1289
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,700
Didn't you just hearthe last song?

1290
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:53,200
Maybe we were wrong.
