      <p begin="00:02:32.867" end="00:02:34.300">God created the Heavens<br/>and the Earth.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.367" end="00:02:35.300">Wait a minute!</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.367" end="00:02:38.433">That's not how it's supposed to begin.<br/>You grabbed the wrong book.</p>

      <p begin="00:02:51.400" end="00:02:54.533">and the thought of being alone<br/>forever bothered Him.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:54.600" end="00:02:57.033">He realized what he needed<br/>were beautiful beings to entertain Him.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.100" end="00:03:00.500">So, God created the angels.</p>

      <p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:09.533">Each angel was hot and sexy</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.600" end="00:03:11.000">and male.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.100" end="00:04:04.200">God loved the angels,</p>

      <p begin="00:04:06.500" end="00:04:08.300">So, God created the Earth.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.900" end="00:04:18.267">&#9834; He made the Earth full<br/>of beauty and wonder. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21.267" end="00:04:30.133">&#9834; He made the sky full<br/>of stars like no one could. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.200" end="00:04:38.700">&#9834; He made the oceans<br/>and rivers and mountains. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.767" end="00:04:42.733">&#9834; And He knew &#9834;</p>

      <p begin="00:09:47.800" end="00:09:49.833">Hey, we weren't going to miss<br/>your big night, huh?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:49.900" end="00:09:52.500">Hey, we've been<br/>to all the others.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.567" end="00:09:53.633">How could we miss your first<br/>New York City opening night?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.700" end="00:09:54.500">The first of many.</p>

      <p begin="00:10:16.500" end="00:10:19.133">We have one hell<br/>of a crowd here.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:21.433">Mostly Sondheim is like<br/>an open mic night for show tunes.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:21.500" end="00:10:23.433">Every song you sing<br/>has to be from a show</p>
      <p begin="00:10:23.500" end="00:10:25.633">or from a songwriter<br/>that has written a show.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.700" end="00:10:27.933">Oh, actually you can sing<br/>whatever you want</p>
      <p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:30.200">if you tip twenty dollars.<br/>We don't care.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.267" end="00:10:32.300">And I couldn't imagine<br/>beginning Mostly Sondheim</p>

      <p begin="00:11:13.000" end="00:11:16.333">&#9834; And the party isn't over<br/>'til the bar runs dry, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.400" end="00:11:20.133">&#9834; and the next one too,<br/>where you catch my eye. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:11:20.200" end="00:11:26.433">&#9834; No the party isn't over 'til we hail<br/>a cab and I go home with you. &#9834;</p>

      <p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:11:59.300">You're gonna finally play<br/>some fucking Sondheim?</p>
      <p begin="00:11:59.367" end="00:12:02.133">No, it means you have to go home<br/>and don't forget to tip!</p>

      <p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:25.500">Look!</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.467" end="00:12:31.833">The homosexual lifestyle<br/>is the biggest threat our nation has,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:31.900" end="00:12:34.400">even more so than terrorism.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:34.467" end="00:12:36.733">And they call themselves<br/>Christians.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:39.533">Didn't Jesus say</p>

      <p begin="00:12:42.367" end="00:12:45.467">Well, that sounds<br/>like a good philosophy.</p>

      <p begin="00:12:55.267" end="00:12:57.200">I guess He approves.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.800" end="00:13:03.700">C'mon.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:03.767" end="00:13:05.600">We've gotta be<br/>good neighbors.</p>

      <p begin="00:18:30.300" end="00:18:32.333">Yes, honey.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:34.033">But we call it the B.I.B.L.E. for short.</p>

      <p begin="00:18:43.667" end="00:18:45.633">What if they don't believe it?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45.700" end="00:18:47.533">They'll believe what they read.</p>

      <p begin="00:20:05.800" end="00:20:07.533">You're cute.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:09.300">Thanks.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:15.733">I'm just here to relax.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:15.800" end="00:20:17.800">I can help with that.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17.867" end="00:20:19.933">I'm actually seeing someone.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:21.700">I'm not gonna tell him.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23.300" end="00:20:25.533">I'm not here to hook up.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:25.600" end="00:20:27.633">C'mon,<br/>just let me suck you off.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27.700" end="00:20:29.233">No!</p>
      <p begin="00:20:29.300" end="00:20:30.600">Just leave me the fuck alone.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32.200" end="00:20:34.600">I tried to be nice but Christ!</p>
      <p begin="00:20:34.667" end="00:20:36.000">Dick.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:38.100" end="00:20:41.033">Can I talk to you about<br/>something?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:41.100" end="00:20:44.400">-Sure, what is it?<br/>-My parents are coming to opening night.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:44.467" end="00:20:46.933">-That's great!<br/>-It is. I mean they've always been</p>
      <p begin="00:20:47.000" end="00:20:49.633">so supportive, but I never expected them<br/>to come all the way for this.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:49.700" end="00:20:52.600">It is your first New York opening.<br/>You shouldn't be surprised.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.667" end="00:20:55.100">I know, but my parents<br/>are very religious.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:55.167" end="00:20:57.900">Oh, so do your parents know<br/>what the show is about?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:57.967" end="00:21:00.733">I told them it was "Adam and Eve<br/>- The Way God Made 'Em".</p>
      <p begin="00:21:00.800" end="00:21:03.100">Yeah, there gonna be surprised.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:03.167" end="00:21:06.000">And they don't know<br/>about me either.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06.067" end="00:21:07.367">This is gonna be good.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:08.367" end="00:21:09.833">I'm sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:09.900" end="00:21:12.000">I'm serious. I'm freaking out.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:12.067" end="00:21:13.900">They wouldn't let us read Harry Potter,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:13.967" end="00:21:16.000">because it was all magic<br/>and against God.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.067" end="00:21:18.133">Well if they think Harry Potter<br/>is sacrilegious,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:18.200" end="00:21:20.133">I cant wait to hear<br/>their review of this show.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:20.200" end="00:21:21.433">I try to be good, I don't have sex...</p>
      <p begin="00:21:21.500" end="00:21:22.900">But you've had sex right?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24.900" end="00:21:27.133">What? Seriously?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:30.533">I wanted to wait for the right guy.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:30.600" end="00:21:32.833">But I don't really go out and meet people<br/>so I never really found one.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:32.900" end="00:21:36.000">Wow. But haven't you<br/>ever been curious?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:36.067" end="00:21:37.833">No.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:37.900" end="00:21:41.033">Yes.<br/>I don't know. Look!</p>
      <p begin="00:21:41.100" end="00:21:42.633">Sex is the last thing on my mind<br/>right now. What am I gonna do?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:42.700" end="00:21:44.300">I wish I knew what to tell you.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:44.367" end="00:21:47.100">My parents are gonna hate me.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:47.167" end="00:21:49.100">No they're not.<br/>It's all gonna be OK. Trust me.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:49.167" end="00:21:51.133">Look, we gotta go.<br/>We'll talk later?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:51.200" end="00:21:52.133">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:52.200" end="00:21:54.000">Ok.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:54.067" end="00:21:57.133">God I wish this wasn't happening.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:00.433">And just as the prophecies foretold,<br/>five thousand years later,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:00.500" end="00:22:02.933">God put Adam and Steve back on the Earth<br/>to prove their love was real,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:03.000" end="00:22:05.700">and able to beat the obstacles<br/>of the modern world.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:05.767" end="00:22:09.233">They were put in different places,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:09.300" end="00:22:13.333">and in homes that used the Breeder's<br/>Informational Book of Living Examples.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:13.400" end="00:22:17.733">&#9834; I was sitting backstage &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:17.800" end="00:22:20.833">&#9834; and wondering what to say &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:20.900" end="00:22:24.833">&#9834; so I raised my hands<br/>to Heaven &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24.900" end="00:22:28.833">&#9834; and I began to pray. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:28.900" end="00:22:30.133">&#9834; And Jesus said to &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:30.200" end="00:22:31.500">&#9834; praise Him. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:31.567" end="00:22:32.833">&#9834; Jesus said to &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:32.900" end="00:22:34.200">&#9834; love Him. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:34.267" end="00:22:35.533">&#9834; Jesus said to &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:37.133">&#9834; glorify Him. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:38.633">&#9834; Yes, Jesus said. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:38.700" end="00:22:40.233">&#9834; Oh, Jesus said &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:40.300" end="00:22:42.500">&#9834; find salvation. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:42.567" end="00:22:45.000">&#9834; He said make a...<br/>donation. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:45.067" end="00:22:46.500">&#9834; Jesus said, oh Jesus said.<br/>Oh, yes he said! &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:22:46.567" end="00:22:49.533">And Jesus said to me, "Patty Maye,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:54.833">Patty Maye, I want you to go out<br/>and tell the peoplehow you feel.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:54.900" end="00:22:58.133">Tell them how you feel<br/>about being a Christian."</p>
      <p begin="00:22:58.200" end="00:23:00.900">So Jesus, this one's for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:02.967" end="00:23:05.100">&#9834; I'm proud to be a Christian &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:05.167" end="00:23:08.300">&#9834; and to love my fellow man. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:08.367" end="00:23:11.100">&#9834; Proud to be a Christian &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:11.167" end="00:23:14.233">&#9834; to help others when I can. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:14.300" end="00:23:17.133">&#9834; I'm proud to be a Christian &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:20.000">&#9834; and be nice to everyone. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:20.067" end="00:23:23.300">&#9834; We're not better<br/>than the Jews or the Arabs &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.367" end="00:23:26.500">&#9834; as they continue to fight. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:26.567" end="00:23:29.233">&#9834; We're not better than<br/>the Catholics, those boozers, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:29.300" end="00:23:34.233">&#9834; but we are always right. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:34.300" end="00:23:37.033">And do you know why<br/>I know we're right?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:37.100" end="00:23:38.400">&#9834; And Jesus said to &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:38.467" end="00:23:39.733">&#9834; praise Him. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39.800" end="00:23:41.033">&#9834; Jesus said to &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:41.100" end="00:23:42.400">&#9834; love Him. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:42.467" end="00:23:43.700">&#9834; Jesus said to &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:43.767" end="00:23:45.233">&#9834; glorify Him. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45.300" end="00:23:46.800">&#9834; Yes, Jesus said. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:23:46.867" end="00:23:48.300">&#9834; Oh, yes He said &#9834;</p>

      <p begin="00:23:54.100" end="00:23:56.367">Isn't she wonderful?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:59.000" end="00:24:01.433">Everyday I thank the Lord<br/>for bringing me Patty Maye.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:01.500" end="00:24:03.633">Now, do you know<br/>what it is time for?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03.700" end="00:24:05.300">Well, I hope so.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:05.367" end="00:24:07.933">It is time to hear about Jesus!</p>
      <p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:10.233">-Amen!<br/>-But before...</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.300" end="00:24:12.833">I can tell y'all<br/>about the word of the Lord,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:12.900" end="00:24:16.133">I need to talk to you<br/>about something very important.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:16.200" end="00:24:19.500">My friends, partners<br/>in my ministry,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19.567" end="00:24:23.333">we have fallen on hard times.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:23.400" end="00:24:28.800">Now, we want to express across<br/>the world our message,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:28.867" end="00:24:31.533">but, we are running out of money!</p>
      <p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:33.933">Now you know all<br/>the money in your wallets</p>
      <p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:36.133">and in your bank accounts<br/>and on your credit cards,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:36.200" end="00:24:38.833">well, that is not your money!</p>
      <p begin="00:24:38.900" end="00:24:41.300">That is God's money,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:41.367" end="00:24:43.633">and God needs his money back!</p>
      <p begin="00:24:43.700" end="00:24:45.833">Hallelujah!</p>
      <p begin="00:24:45.900" end="00:24:47.833">And then last thing, just<br/>at the end of "creation"</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47.900" end="00:24:49.933">I want a sforzando on the "aah",</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:51.733">so just watch me,<br/>it will be like "aaaaahh!"</p>
      <p begin="00:24:51.800" end="00:24:52.933">Like that, yeah?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53.000" end="00:24:54.100">Yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:54.167" end="00:24:55.433">Thank you so much.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:55.500" end="00:24:56.633">Have a good second act.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:56.700" end="00:24:57.500">Thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:01.500">So, what do you think I should do?</p>

      <p begin="00:33:35.800" end="00:33:38.833">Well, Benny and I talked to him,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:38.900" end="00:33:44.900">and we read him parts of the Bible<br/>where it says homosexuality is wrong.</p>

      <p begin="00:38:02.267" end="00:38:04.600">Is it strange<br/>that he's not calling me back?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.667" end="00:38:06.867">Who?<br/>Oh, thanks.</p>

      <p begin="00:38:11.800" end="00:38:14.433">What'd you think was gonna happen?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.500" end="00:38:16.933">You met him. You had sex.<br/>That's pretty much the end of it.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.000" end="00:38:20.333">But I thought he liked me.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:23.233">Eddie, it's not about liking you<br/>or not liking you. It was just sex!</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23.300" end="00:38:27.933">-But it was so special.<br/>-It was just sex, trust me.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.000" end="00:38:33.633">Just sex? So I should just go out<br/>and have sex with people?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:33.700" end="00:38:35.500">What the hell do I know?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:37.867" end="00:38:40.500">Why does being gay<br/>have to be this hard?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40.567" end="00:38:44.133">I don't know, but you can't<br/>let this get you down.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.200" end="00:38:48.100">You can't let this asshole hurt you.<br/>You just have to pick up and move on.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:48.167" end="00:38:50.500">Everything is gonna be OK.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.567" end="00:38:53.133">And if you're looking<br/>for more then sex,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:55.000">you don't sleep with the guy<br/>an hour after you met him.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.067" end="00:38:57.067">I just feel awful.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58.300" end="00:39:00.000">And my butt still hurts.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.067" end="00:39:02.400">I'm sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.500" end="00:39:07.633">As Homer Simpson so admirably put it,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:07.700" end="00:39:13.233">"To alcohol, the cause of,<br/>and solution to, all of life's problems."</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.300" end="00:39:16.567">So, what are you gonna do<br/>about Sebastian?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.700" end="00:39:50.133">Paul?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:50.200" end="00:39:51.500">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:00.833">Hey!</p>

      <p begin="00:40:02.700" end="00:40:05.200">No, I'm fine.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:05.267" end="00:40:08.633">I just have a lot on my mind<br/>right now. A lot!</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.700" end="00:40:11.633">Look, I can't really talk right now.<br/>I'm on my way to a dance class,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11.700" end="00:40:13.133">but I'll call you later.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:14.767">Bye, love you.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:17.400" end="00:40:20.833">Hey Sebastian, it's Paul.<br/>Again.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:20.900" end="00:40:24.333">Listen, I just got tested for you<br/>and I'm negative.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:25.900">We need to talk.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:29.200" end="00:40:31.700">What are you writing,<br/>your memoirs?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31.767" end="00:40:34.533">No, I'm just trying to get<br/>my thoughts together.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:34.600" end="00:40:37.200">You're OK?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:37.267" end="00:40:40.333">Yeah, this whole Sebastian thing<br/>is just freaking me out.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:43.300">Oh, I got tested.<br/>-And?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:43.367" end="00:40:46.800">-I'm negative.<br/>-Of course.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:46.867" end="00:40:49.500">But no matter how safe you are, those tests<br/>are just so nerve-wracking.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:49.567" end="00:40:51.933">What did Sebastian say when you<br/>told him you were tested?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:54.133">Nothing. He hasn't even<br/>called me back yet.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:54.200" end="00:40:55.533">He's an asshole.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:55.600" end="00:40:58.333">No, he's just confused.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58.400" end="00:41:01.500">No, he's an asshole.<br/>You at least deserve a phone call.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:01.567" end="00:41:03.333">You know, I try and look<br/>for a healthy monogamous relationship,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03.400" end="00:41:06.333">or someone to spend<br/>my life with,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:09.633">but I always end up getting fucked.<br/>And not in a good way.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:09.700" end="00:41:13.633">That's why I don't do the love thing anymore.<br/>It get's too complicated.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13.700" end="00:41:17.233">What you need is to get fucked...<br/>and in a good way!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.300" end="00:41:21.900">I want a husband, two point five kids,<br/>a house in the Hamptons and a dog.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21.967" end="00:41:24.433">I don't wanna be a slut<br/>like everyone else.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24.500" end="00:41:27.000">Are you talking about me?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:27.067" end="00:41:28.533">Oh, I don't think the word slut<br/>does you justice.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:28.600" end="00:41:29.833">Bitch!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29.900" end="00:41:30.933">Whore!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:31.000" end="00:41:31.933">Slut!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:34.000">Oh, you wish!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:34.067" end="00:41:36.233">Look, if you wanna change,<br/>then change.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:36.300" end="00:41:38.533">If you don't,<br/>then stop bitching about it!</p>
      <p begin="00:41:38.600" end="00:41:42.733">It's just sex,<br/>it doesn't have to be special.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:45.933">It's just like working out.<br/>But with someone else.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:48.800">But I want sex to be special -<br/>to mean something.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:48.867" end="00:41:50.300">But why?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:55.600">Imagine if you went to a theme park<br/>and walked around</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55.667" end="00:41:58.633">until you found<br/>the perfect rollercoaster.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:58.700" end="00:42:01.133">By the time you picked the right one,<br/>the park would be closed,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:03.633">and you wouldn't have gotten<br/>to enjoy anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:03.700" end="00:42:07.233">Sometimes you should just<br/>shut up and enjoy the ride.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:07.300" end="00:42:09.100">Cute analogy.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:09.167" end="00:42:10.233">I am impressed.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.300" end="00:42:11.633">Thanks.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:11.700" end="00:42:14.033">Go on.<br/>Be a slut.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:14.100" end="00:42:17.933">Be a great big slut. Try 'Manhunt.'</p>
      <p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:19.900">I'm not going on 'Manhunt.'</p>

      <p begin="00:42:37.367" end="00:42:40.800">and pulled out a song<br/>that I've never ever sung before.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:40.867" end="00:42:44.867">It seems to be the new theme song<br/>since I've had my 'epiphany.'</p>

      <p begin="01:03:57.300" end="01:04:00.633">Could you imagine if I tried<br/>to be like the people I grew up around?</p>
      <p begin="01:04:00.700" end="01:04:04.800">I'd be watching professional wrestling<br/>and drinking beer out of a can.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:04.867" end="01:04:06.933">A can, Eddie!</p>
      <p begin="01:04:07.000" end="01:04:09.400">For a date I'd buy<br/>a nice box of wine,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:09.467" end="01:04:13.633">drive to a parking lot<br/>to grab some girl's titties.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:13.700" end="01:04:15.900">I don't mind being different.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:15.967" end="01:04:17.433">I like it.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:17.500" end="01:04:20.400">Because I know I'm better!</p>
      <p begin="01:04:20.467" end="01:04:21.400">This is me.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:22.700" end="01:04:24.533">Take it or leave it.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:24.600" end="01:04:26.400">How is being a slut<br/>going for you?</p>
      <p begin="01:04:26.467" end="01:04:27.200">Not too well.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:28.667" end="01:04:30.033">I even hired a hustler.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:30.100" end="01:04:32.867">Really?<br/>Was it good?</p>
      <p begin="01:04:35.067" end="01:04:37.433">We cuddled.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:37.500" end="01:04:39.933">You hired a hustler and you<br/>just cuddled with him?</p>
      <p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:41.933">And you thought bottoming<br/>for a bottom was pathetic.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:43.933">I know, Eddie.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:44.000" end="01:04:46.833">I'm just trying<br/>to figure out who I am.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:46.900" end="01:04:49.400">And sometimes,<br/>when everyone around you</p>
      <p begin="01:04:49.467" end="01:04:52.333">tells you you're supposed<br/>to be something else,</p>
      <p begin="01:04:52.400" end="01:04:54.933">you start to think you are.</p>
      <p begin="01:04:55.000" end="01:04:58.300">So you don't think<br/>you really wanna be a slut?</p>
      <p begin="01:04:58.367" end="01:05:00.400">I just wanna be loved.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:02.600" end="01:05:04.400">Do you think my parents<br/>still love me?</p>
      <p begin="01:05:06.000" end="01:05:07.500">What do you think?</p>
      <p begin="01:05:09.167" end="01:05:10.767">You always make me feel better.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:12.667" end="01:05:14.600">It is gonna be OK.</p>
      <p begin="01:05:16.267" end="01:05:18.633">&#9834; The day I met you,&#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:05:18.700" end="01:05:21.033">&#9834; I could hear the overture start &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:05:21.100" end="01:05:24.200">&#9834; like a musical theatre love story &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:05:24.267" end="01:05:27.800">&#9834; where a lover gives his heart. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:05:27.867" end="01:05:33.533">&#9834; I have never been in love. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:05:33.600" end="01:05:41.200">&#9834; This has got to be<br/>our gift from God above. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:05:45.300" end="01:05:47.833">&#9834; I won't change for you. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:05:47.900" end="01:05:51.700">&#9834; I won't become somebody else. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:05:51.767" end="01:05:57.400">&#9834; I am now the man<br/>I'm supposed to be. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:05:57.467" end="01:06:00.700">&#9834; I won't change for you. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:06:00.767" end="01:06:04.833">&#9834; I won't change for you my God. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:06:04.900" end="01:06:12.567">&#9834; I just want to know<br/>you love me as I am. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:06:18.900" end="01:06:23.333">&#9834; This is our musical theatre love story. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:06:23.400" end="01:06:26.033">&#9834; We're making it scene to scene. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:06:26.100" end="01:06:29.033">&#9834; Our love is strong and growing &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:06:29.100" end="01:06:31.500">&#9834; on our journey to be free. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:07:43.000" end="01:07:45.833">-Hey Paul, can I ask you something?<br/>-Of course.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:45.900" end="01:07:49.233">-I have a sore throat.<br/>-Take a cough drop.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:49.300" end="01:07:52.500">No, I read online that it can be<br/>one of the first signs of HIV and...</p>
      <p begin="01:07:52.567" end="01:07:55.233">also my glands are swollen, and...</p>
      <p begin="01:07:55.300" end="01:07:57.433">If you're scared<br/>you should go get tested. It's free.</p>
      <p begin="01:07:57.500" end="01:08:00.100">Do you think I might be?</p>
      <p begin="01:08:00.167" end="01:08:02.233">After just once? I mean,<br/>wouldn't it be like a sign from...</p>
      <p begin="01:08:02.300" end="01:08:04.633">From what? God? Look,<br/>HIV is a disease.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:04.700" end="01:08:08.233">It has nothing to do with<br/>God or punishment.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:08.300" end="01:08:12.133">If God wanted us dead, he'd send down<br/>the fires of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:12.200" end="01:08:14.100">Just go get tested.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:14.167" end="01:08:16.333">Would you go with me?</p>
      <p begin="01:08:16.400" end="01:08:18.133">Of course. But you're gonna<br/>owe me a drink.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:18.200" end="01:08:19.900">And next time wrap it up.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:21.300" end="01:08:23.200">God you're so stupid.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:27.500" end="01:08:30.633">Alright everybody, we have<br/>a very special treat tonight.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:30.700" end="01:08:33.000">We're about to pop<br/>somebody's cherry everybody.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:33.067" end="01:08:35.733">We have a Mostly Sondheim virgin!</p>
      <p begin="01:08:35.800" end="01:08:37.300">Come on up Charles!</p>
      <p begin="01:08:41.967" end="01:08:43.700">Well, umm</p>
      <p begin="01:08:46.667" end="01:08:50.433">I'd like to dedicate this song<br/>to a special guy I keep bumping into.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:50.500" end="01:08:53.500">I don't really know<br/>how to talk to him so...</p>
      <p begin="01:08:53.567" end="01:08:58.000">I thought I would try talking<br/>to him in his language - music.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:58.067" end="01:09:00.867">So I wrote this for him.</p>
      <p begin="01:09:14.200" end="01:09:19.500">&#9834; I have never believed<br/>in fate before, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:19.567" end="01:09:24.300">&#9834; but I'm seeing you most everyday. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:24.367" end="01:09:26.900">&#9834; You've been haunting my mind, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:26.967" end="01:09:30.133">&#9834; since I saw you in the light, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:30.200" end="01:09:34.833">&#9834; and you took my breath away. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:34.900" end="01:09:37.900">&#9834; There are forces at work &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:37.967" end="01:09:40.633">&#9834; that we don't understand, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:40.700" end="01:09:43.400">&#9834; but they're bringing us closer &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:43.467" end="01:09:48.200">&#9834; as if it were planned. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:48.267" end="01:09:53.800">&#9834; If someone up there<br/>wants us to be together, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:53.867" end="01:09:58.333">&#9834; then who are we to disagree? &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:58.400" end="01:10:03.433">&#9834; If someone wiser knows<br/>we'd be good together, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:03.500" end="01:10:08.033">&#9834; it's not our place to ask why, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:08.100" end="01:10:15.333">&#9834; and I think we should<br/>give it a try. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:15.400" end="01:10:19.833">&#9834; If providence deems<br/>we fall in love, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:19.900" end="01:10:24.033">&#9834; then there's nothing<br/>we can do. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:24.100" end="01:10:29.233">&#9834; And I cannot deny what<br/>I'm feeling deep inside, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:29.300" end="01:10:33.533">&#9834; and I think you feel it too. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:35.833">&#9834; So it's hopeless to fight. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:35.900" end="01:10:38.433">&#9834; There's no place to retreat. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:38.500" end="01:10:44.000">&#9834; So give into your heart<br/>for surrender is sweet. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:46.800" end="01:10:48.933">Look, I should let you<br/>know that I'm</p>
      <p begin="01:10:49.000" end="01:10:50.900">really not looking to hook<br/>up or anything.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:50.967" end="01:10:53.533">Me neither.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:55.533">I just came out to my parents<br/>and it didn't go very well</p>
      <p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:10:57.933">so the last thing on<br/>my mind is sex.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:00.433">I can't even imagine telling<br/>my parents I'm gay.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:00.500" end="01:11:02.433">I'm Mormon.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:02.500" end="01:11:05.033">Is that worse than being<br/>a Southern Baptist?</p>
      <p begin="01:11:05.100" end="01:11:09.433">&#9834; And I think we should<br/>give it a try. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:11:09.500" end="01:11:17.900">&#9834; I think we should give it a try. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:11:28.667" end="01:11:31.433">-How'd it go?<br/>-Good. I'm fine,</p>
      <p begin="01:11:31.500" end="01:11:34.233">but they want me to come back<br/>in a few months to do it again.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:34.300" end="01:11:37.633">-OK.<br/>-Oh, I can't leave yet.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:37.700" end="01:11:39.800">They want to take me back and give me<br/>a counseling session in a few.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:39.867" end="01:11:42.233">Teach me about safe sex.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:42.300" end="01:11:44.733">No problem.<br/>I can wait.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:47.000">Thank you so much<br/>for coming with me.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:48.967" end="01:11:51.200">I'm glad you're OK.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:56.300" end="01:11:57.500">So...</p>
      <p begin="01:11:59.000" end="01:11:59.900">I met a cute boy last night.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:59.967" end="01:12:01.033">Oh, me too!</p>
      <p begin="01:12:01.100" end="01:12:02.600">Mine sang me a song.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:02.667" end="01:12:04.100">Mine's a Mormon.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:06.000" end="01:12:08.567">I think we're both<br/>pretty damn pathetic.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:10.900" end="01:12:14.200">I think I like being pathetic.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:14.267" end="01:12:17.200">Eddie, you wanna come back now?</p>
      <p begin="01:12:26.900" end="01:12:28.100">David?</p>
      <p begin="01:13:00.700" end="01:13:03.900">I can't believe we're doing this.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:03.967" end="01:13:06.400">We said we were going to be here.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:06.467" end="01:13:08.833">We can't miss<br/>the biggest opening night of his life.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:08.900" end="01:13:14.033">Even if the whole show<br/>just seems so wrong?</p>
      <p begin="01:13:14.100" end="01:13:18.900">I am just as troubled<br/>by all of this as you are,</p>
      <p begin="01:13:18.967" end="01:13:21.167">but he's still our son.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:29.400" end="01:13:31.933">Hey everyone.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:34.733">Now remember Patty has a new song<br/>at the end of the show.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:34.800" end="01:13:37.600">I can't believe they're adding<br/>a new song opening night.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:37.667" end="01:13:40.400">They don't call it off-Broadway<br/>for nothing.</p>
      <p begin="01:13:44.400" end="01:13:47.133">Ladies and gentlemen,<br/>welcome to opening night</p>
      <p begin="01:13:47.200" end="01:13:50.100">of "Adam and Steve - Just<br/>the Way God Made'Em!"</p>
      <p begin="01:13:50.167" end="01:13:53.900">Before we begin, we must inform you<br/>that the coalition of Christians</p>
      <p begin="01:13:53.967" end="01:13:57.200">has rated our show "FLAMING."</p>
      <p begin="01:13:57.267" end="01:13:59.933">This doesn't mean we condone or encourage<br/>the homosexual lifestyle.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:02.600">It just means that<br/>if you enjoy our show,</p>
      <p begin="01:14:02.667" end="01:14:05.900">You'll end up burning in Hell<br/>right next to us!</p>
      <p begin="01:14:10.167" end="01:14:14.333">God? If you're listening,<br/>we need some help!</p>
      <p begin="01:14:14.400" end="01:14:17.933">I'm frightened Adam, I'm frightened!</p>
      <p begin="01:14:18.000" end="01:14:20.033">We're lost in the woods and we don't know<br/>where we're supposed to be going.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:20.100" end="01:14:21.700">Hello!</p>
      <p begin="01:14:26.300" end="01:14:30.033">Are you a good witch or a bad witch?</p>
      <p begin="01:14:30.100" end="01:14:32.100">Why, I'm not a witch at all.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:32.167" end="01:14:35.333">I'm your guardian angel, Dorothy.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:35.400" end="01:14:39.100">An angel? Did God send you here<br/>to bring us to Hell?</p>
      <p begin="01:14:39.167" end="01:14:43.733">No Dear. He sent me here<br/>to bring you to New York City.</p>
      <p begin="01:14:43.800" end="01:14:46.733">New York City is God's favorite city,</p>
      <p begin="01:14:46.800" end="01:14:50.967">but you can't go there shirtless. Here!</p>
      <p begin="01:14:53.000" end="01:14:54.533">Wear these.</p>

      <p begin="01:14:56.500" end="01:14:59.600">Trust me, Steve. It'll look divine!</p>
      <p begin="01:15:01.067" end="01:15:03.067">These do look good.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:04.667" end="01:15:06.000">You look great.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:06.067" end="01:15:08.033">You too.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:08.100" end="01:15:10.333">Did you think I would steer you wrong?</p>
      <p begin="01:15:10.400" end="01:15:13.700">After all, you're both<br/>friends of Dorothy now.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:13.767" end="01:15:15.033">Can I ask you a question?</p>
      <p begin="01:15:15.100" end="01:15:16.700">Of course Steve.</p>
      <p begin="01:15:16.767" end="01:15:18.933">Does God hate us because<br/>we're gay?</p>
      <p begin="01:15:19.000" end="01:15:21.200">Honey, how could you even think that?</p>
      <p begin="01:15:23.667" end="01:15:26.733">&#9834; God made all<br/>different types of people &#9834;</p>

      <p begin="01:15:29.500" end="01:15:32.833">&#9834; He made all of the breeders &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:15:32.900" end="01:15:36.100">&#9834; to make more gays<br/>like you and you. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:15:36.167" end="01:15:38.833">&#9834; So sure, they might be jealous. &#9834;</p>

      <p begin="01:16:26.400" end="01:16:27.867">is being a Jew.</p>

      <p begin="01:19:16.300" end="01:19:18.867">You know what this journey has taught me?<br/>-What?</p>
      <p begin="01:19:20.800" end="01:19:22.900">That I want you in my life forever.</p>
      <p begin="01:19:24.400" end="01:19:25.900">Steve?</p>
      <p begin="01:19:28.067" end="01:19:29.233">Will you marry me?</p>

      <p begin="01:19:31.900" end="01:19:36.333">No, no, no! You can't do this.<br/>This is an abomination.</p>
      <p begin="01:19:36.400" end="01:19:41.333">The Lord God said that two men<br/>should not sleep in the same bed.</p>
      <p begin="01:19:41.400" end="01:19:44.633">It is Adam and Eve,<br/>not Adam and Steve.</p>

      <p begin="01:20:00.900" end="01:20:02.267">Let there be darkness.</p>
      <p begin="01:20:03.900" end="01:20:06.800">I said LET THERE BE DARKNESS!</p>

      <p begin="01:20:08.900" end="01:20:10.900">Why the fuck is it so dark down here?</p>
      <p begin="01:20:14.700" end="01:20:19.933">If you are God, then you know<br/>it's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.</p>

      <p begin="01:20:22.400" end="01:20:24.400">But your book specifically says...</p>
      <p begin="01:20:26.100" end="01:20:28.833">My book? Who said it was my book?</p>
      <p begin="01:20:28.900" end="01:20:32.300">What do you think,<br/>I faxed it down here?</p>
      <p begin="01:20:32.367" end="01:20:34.833">It was written by man.</p>
      <p begin="01:20:34.900" end="01:20:37.700">It was interpreted by man.</p>
      <p begin="01:20:37.767" end="01:20:40.533">It was abused by man.</p>
      <p begin="01:20:40.600" end="01:20:43.000">I never told people to hurt and kill.</p>
      <p begin="01:20:43.067" end="01:20:44.700">I told everyone to love.</p>
      <p begin="01:20:44.767" end="01:20:47.733">You mean, you love the gays?</p>
      <p begin="01:20:47.800" end="01:20:50.700">Didn't you just hear<br/>the last song?</p>
      <p begin="01:20:50.767" end="01:20:53.200">Maybe we were wrong.</p>
      <p begin="01:20:55.400" end="01:20:59.433">I'm so sorry we tried to change you.</p>
      <p begin="01:20:59.500" end="01:21:02.200">Can you ever forgive us?<br/>-Of course I can.</p>
      <p begin="01:21:02.267" end="01:21:04.733">I love you both so much.</p>
      <p begin="01:21:04.800" end="01:21:06.800">I guess we were wrong.</p>
      <p begin="01:21:11.700" end="01:21:13.933">Forgive me</p>
      <p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:18.200">&#9834; I didn't realize 'til now &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:21:18.267" end="01:21:24.633">&#9834; that our cold, self-righteous words<br/>could hurt you so. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:21:24.700" end="01:21:28.700">&#9834; I was taught very young, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:21:28.767" end="01:21:32.333">&#9834; by those who came before me, &#9834;</p>
