      <p begin="01:08:33.067" end="01:08:35.733">We have a MostlySondheim virgin!</p>
      <p begin="01:08:35.800" end="01:08:37.300">Come on up Charles!</p>
      <p begin="01:08:41.967" end="01:08:43.700">Well, umm</p>
      <p begin="01:08:46.667" end="01:08:50.433">I'd like to dedicate thissong to a special guy Ikeep bumping into.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:50.500" end="01:08:53.500">I don't really know howto talk to him so...</p>
      <p begin="01:08:53.567" end="01:08:58.000">I thought I would try talkingto him in his language- music.</p>
      <p begin="01:08:58.067" end="01:09:00.867">So I wrote this for him.</p>
      <p begin="01:09:14.200" end="01:09:19.500">&#9834; I have never believed in fate before, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:19.567" end="01:09:24.300">&#9834; but I'm seeing you most everyday. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:24.367" end="01:09:26.900">&#9834; You've been haunting my mind, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:26.967" end="01:09:30.133">&#9834; since I saw you in the light, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:30.200" end="01:09:34.833">&#9834; and you took my breath away. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:34.900" end="01:09:37.900">&#9834; There are forces at work &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:37.967" end="01:09:40.633">&#9834; that we don't understand, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:40.700" end="01:09:43.400">&#9834; but they're bringing us closer &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:43.467" end="01:09:48.200">&#9834; as if it were planned. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:48.267" end="01:09:53.800">&#9834; If someone up there wants us to be together, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:53.867" end="01:09:58.333">&#9834; then who are we to disagree? &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:09:58.400" end="01:10:03.433">&#9834; If someone wiser knows we'd be good together, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:03.500" end="01:10:08.033">&#9834; it's not our place to ask why, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:08.100" end="01:10:15.333">&#9834; and I think we should give it a try. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:15.400" end="01:10:19.833">&#9834; If providence deems we fall in love, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:19.900" end="01:10:24.033">&#9834; then there's nothing we can do. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:24.100" end="01:10:29.233">&#9834; And I cannot deny what I'm feeling deep inside, &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:29.300" end="01:10:33.533">&#9834; and I think you feel it too. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:35.833">&#9834; So it's hopeless to fight. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:35.900" end="01:10:38.433">&#9834; There's no place to retreat. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:38.500" end="01:10:44.000">&#9834; So give into your heart for surrender is sweet. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:10:46.800" end="01:10:48.933">Look, I should let youknow that I'm</p>
      <p begin="01:10:49.000" end="01:10:50.900">really not looking to hookup or anything.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:50.967" end="01:10:53.533">Me neither.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:55.533">I just came out to my parentsand it didn't go very well</p>
      <p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:10:57.933">so the last thing onmy mind is sex.</p>
      <p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:00.433">I can't even imagine tellingmy parents I'm gay.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:00.500" end="01:11:02.433">I'm Mormon.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:02.500" end="01:11:05.033">Is that worse than beinga Southern Baptist?</p>
      <p begin="01:11:05.100" end="01:11:09.433">&#9834; And I think we should give it a try. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:11:09.500" end="01:11:17.900">&#9834; I think we should give it a try. &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="01:11:28.667" end="01:11:31.433">-How'd it go?-Good. I'm fine,</p>
      <p begin="01:11:31.500" end="01:11:34.233">but they want me tocome back in a few monthsto do it again.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:34.300" end="01:11:37.633">-OK.-Oh, I can't leave yet.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:37.700" end="01:11:39.800">They want to take me back andgive me a counseling sessionin a few.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:39.867" end="01:11:42.233">Teach me about safe sex.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:42.300" end="01:11:44.733">No problem.I can wait.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:47.000">Thank you so much forcoming with me.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:48.967" end="01:11:51.200">I'm glad you're OK.</p>
      <p begin="01:11:56.300" end="01:11:57.500">So...</p>
      <p begin="01:11:59.000" end="01:11:59.900">I met a cute boy last night.</p>

      <p begin="01:12:06.000" end="01:12:08.567">I think we're both prettydamn pathetic.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:10.900" end="01:12:14.200">I think I like being pathetic.</p>
      <p begin="01:12:14.267" end="01:12:17.200">Eddie, you wanna come back now?</p>
