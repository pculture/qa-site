      <p begin="00:01:35,172" end="00:01:38,261">Andrew and Emily all your queries.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38,261" end="00:01:42,695">So, I really encourage you to send them through because it is an,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:01:42,695" end="00:01:45,266">important topic and something</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45,266" end="00:01:49,757">that I&#8217;m sure a lot of you do have questions about.</p>

      <p begin="00:02:22,824" end="00:02:25,766">So, you can relax a little bit.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:02:25,766" end="00:02:28,039">or feel free to take notes if you want to.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:02:28,039" end="00:02:31,516">So, I'll now hand over and to let them introduce<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:02:31,516" end="00:02:34,920">themselves properly, to Andrew and Emily.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:02:34,920" end="00:02:38,074">(Andrew) Great. Thanks Cara. My name is Andrew Baird.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38,074" end="00:02:47,921">I'm a principal with WHK Accountants and Advisors, and we specialise in providing accounting and advisory services to the SME market.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:02:47,921" end="00:02:54,967">(Emily) And my name is Emily Jaksch and I'm also with the SME market and run a HR consultancy.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:54,967" end="00:02:58,694">(Andrew) And today, Emily and I are going to be talking to you about</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58,694" end="00:03:05,858">how we deal with customers who won't pay. And it's all the key areas we're going to cover off today.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:05,858" end="00:03:11,783">First of all we're going to be talking about key cashflow issues,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:11,783" end="00:03:17,122">that affect businesses.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:17,122" end="00:03:22,864">How to avoid common cashflow mistakes, and tips for preventing customers<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:22,864" end="00:03:28,526">becoming late payers, and ways to deal with late paying customers.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:28,526" end="00:03:34,055">And as Cara said in the introduction please, we're more than happy to<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:34,055" end="00:03:36,624">take questions throughout the presentation as we go along.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:36,624" end="00:03:42,026">So make sure you get tapping as topics that come up or questions come up.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:42,026" end="00:03:47,887">Emily and I, we're more than happy to take those questions from you throughout the presentation.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:47,887" end="00:03:54,260">So, really quickly, there's so many causes of cashflow issues, in business.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:03:54,260" end="00:04:00,970">Unplanned capital purchases, debtors not paying, not managing your stock,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:00,970" end="00:04:05,004">over spending, lack of systems and processes, too much bank debt,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:05,004" end="00:04:09,328">inefficient operations, poor planning, poor record keeping,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:09,328" end="00:04:11,714">and not managing the creditors properly.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:11,714" end="00:04:13,538">The list could go on and on.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:13,538" end="00:04:16,221">Em, as a business owner, what are some of the things that<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:16,221" end="00:04:22,863">you've experienced that have been key causes of cash flow issues, and financials.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:22,863" end="00:04:25,588">(Emily) I guess the key to issue is not having a process.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25,588" end="00:04:30,503">If you don't focus on it everyday, it just kind of gets away from you.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:30,503" end="00:04:37,920">So that's probably the biggest thing I have learnt<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>as a small business owner, is that you need to have a clear process, </p>
      <p begin="00:04:37,920" end="00:04:43,185">a good invoicing process, good relationships, and that you follow that through.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:43,185" end="00:04:46,426">(Andrew) Yes, so a far bit of planning involved in keeping on top of cashflow?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46,426" end="00:04:47,816">(Emily) Yes, definitely.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></p>
      <p begin="00:04:47,816" end="00:04:48,921">(Andrew) Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48,921" end="00:04:55,170">And so as a business which provides services to other SME's and large corporates,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:55,170" end="00:04:59,254">so would debtors be a key issue for you?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:04:59,254" end="00:05:06,681">(Emily) It is a big issue for us. We've got our debtor day down to 14 days, which is really good,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:06,681" end="00:05:13,539">but that's only because we're on top of it every single day. I used to have a manual spreadsheet that I would use. </p>
      <p begin="00:05:13,539" end="00:05:18,355"> Now I use Xerox which is really good. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:05:18,355" end="00:05:22,046">Its automated the whole process, so there's no double entry involved.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:05:22,046" end="00:05:27,086">Now, we veered away from that, it's been really good for our cash flow.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:05:27,086" end="00:05:31,028">(Andrew) Yeah. So, if we just move on, even I,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31,028" end="00:05:35,588">we could get top three causes of cash flow issues in small businesses.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:05:35,588" end="00:05:41,171">It's really poor debtor management, lack of planning, and poor record keeping.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:05:41,171" end="00:05:44,192">Those are what we see, and it's certainly what you've experienced<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:05:44,192" end="00:05:46,921">(Emily) Sure definitely. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></p>
      <p begin="00:05:46,921" end="00:05:50,276">(Andrew) So, moving now, how to avoid...<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></p>
      <p begin="00:05:50,276" end="00:05:52,735">(Cara) Andrew and Emily, sorry, sorry to interrupt there.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52,735" end="00:05:53,891">We're just getting feedback,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:05:53,891" end="00:05:56,724">people are having trouble listening to you.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:05:56,724" end="00:06:00,786">Are you able to speak into the microphone as we were, as we were doing before? <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:00,786" end="00:06:04,670">Apologies everyone.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:04,670" end="00:06:08,088">(Andrew) That's okay, let's see how we go now. </p>
      <p begin="00:06:08,088" end="00:06:09,925">So, let's talk about how we can...<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:09,925" end="00:06:13,689">(Cara) It's better from my end. So, yes, we're getting confirmation.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13,689" end="00:06:15,672">People are preferring that. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:15,672" end="00:06:17,921">And Emily as well, when it's your turn,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:17,921" end="00:06:21,154">if you just speak, speak better, more clearly into the microphone.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:21,154" end="00:06:22,753">Thank you.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:22,753" end="00:06:24,586">(Andrew) Sorry. So, let's have a chat Em</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24,586" end="00:06:27,899">about how we can avoid some of these cashflow mistakes.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:27,899" end="00:06:31,850">Some of the things and the tips that we've come up with here are<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:31,850" end="00:06:36,296">making sure there's clear roles and responsibilities in the business,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:36,296" end="00:06:41,399">good stock management, good reporting, regular cash flow forecasting,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:41,399" end="00:06:45,875">refinancing early, customer selections, choosing your customers,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:45,875" end="00:06:51,361">having a really good systems and processes around debtor management. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:51,361" end="00:06:57,504">Real-time information, Em, you mentioned before that you were using spreadsheets to manage your business.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:06:57,504" end="00:06:58,551">(Emily) Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58,551" end="00:07:01,049">(Andrew) And, so, tell us a little bit about that <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></p>
      <p begin="00:07:01,049" end="00:07:04,338">and what prompted you to move to Xerox.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:07:04,338" end="00:07:10,504">(Emily) Sure. So, initially, I was using a spreadsheet to look at when people pay. </p>
      <p begin="00:07:10,504" end="00:07:17,194">If they haven't paid me, if the invoices were overdue, I would start going through a processing of emailing them, <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:07:17,194" end="00:07:24,695">and calling them, which was a lot of work because you had to switch between your bank statement,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:07:24,695" end="00:07:29,691">or online banking and the spreadsheet, which didn't make sense at all.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:07:29,691" end="00:07:32,503">And then my accountant introduced me to Xerox,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:07:32,503" end="00:07:40,210">which is a fantastic tool because it gives you real-time information because it links through to your bank statement.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:07:40,210" end="00:07:44,605">So, you can very easily see who hasn't paid,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:07:44,605" end="00:07:50,420">and everyday you can be on top of it, which is really important in my reports.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:07:50,420" end="00:07:57,752">On debtor day, you have a really good idea of who your offenders are, which is also really helpful.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57,752" end="00:08:01,170">(Andrew) So, you can do all your invoicing through Xerox and you automatically,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01,170" end="00:08:02,280">(Emily) Yep,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02,280" end="00:08:05,196">(Andrew) you can see without having to go to the bank who's paid and who hasn't.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05,196" end="00:08:08,851">(Emily) Exactly. It's like, so everyday you reconcile your account.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08,851" end="00:08:12,540">Through the link to your bank statement so you can see<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:08:12,540" end="00:08:16,861">what money is going out, coming in, and whether it's overdue.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:08:16,861" end="00:08:23,133">You can also send follow up invoices through that system to the people who aren't paying.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23,133" end="00:08:25,814">(Andrew) So, it really makes cash flow management, and cash flow planning,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:08:25,814" end="00:08:28,088">and debtors really front line, is that..?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:08:28,088" end="00:08:29,671">(Emily) Definitely.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:29,671" end="00:08:31,965">(Andrew) Yeah, yep. One thing that we see,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31,965" end="00:08:36,633">and we've got it noted up there on the slides, is raising finance early with cashflow forecasting.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36,633" end="00:08:41,102">And see, a lot of businesses that come to us and haven't done adequate planning,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:08:41,102" end="00:08:45,877">and are looking to raise finance when it's often too late.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:45,877" end="00:08:51,139">So, that cashflow forecasting and regular forecasting is so important.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:08:51,139" end="00:08:54,792">Often it's too late by the time you realize<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:08:54,792" end="00:09:02,094">that you're in a cashflow.. a bit of cashflow difficulty, it's too late to be going to the bank and asking for more money.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:09:02,094" end="00:09:10,117">(Emily) Yep, I'll totally agree, I think that initially as a small business owner it's probably not everybody's skillset,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10,117" end="00:09:18,279">is managing finance. So it's something that you'll want to put off, and then you realise how much it impacts on everything that you're doing</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18,279" end="00:09:26,786">but you need to focus on this, this is really important, and I hear from lots of business owners that this is one of the <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:09:26,786" end="00:09:34,474">key reasons that businesses fail, is a lack of cashflow management, so definitely forecast and be prepared </p>
      <p begin="00:09:34,474" end="00:09:41,004">and not bury your head in the sand, pretending that things will get better, is paramount.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:41,004" end="00:09:43,003">(Andrew) Absolutely, having the right information...</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43,003" end="00:09:47,503">(Cara) I've got one question for the two of you already that's coming from Jan.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:47,503" end="00:09:51,588">Jan wants to know what's the difference between a budget and a forecast.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:09:51,588" end="00:09:54,840">(Andrew) That's a good question, Jan.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:54,840" end="00:10:00,646">For me, and if I'll answer it, let me go first on this.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:00,646" end="00:10:06,024">For me, a budget is something that we would see a business doing it, at the start of the year,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:06,024" end="00:10:13,624">and really setting the goals for maybe the next 12 months or maybe even as far out as<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:13,624" end="00:10:20,788">maybe 3 years and using it as a tool to track the performance of the business.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:20,788" end="00:10:23,253">That's setting yourself a good 12-month goal.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:23,253" end="00:10:26,528">A forecast, we would say, is something you update more reguarly.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:26,528" end="00:10:33,348">So, we would encourage our clients to do a budget, probably sometime between now and June.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:33,348" end="00:10:38,274">So, they've got a clear picture of where they want the business to be<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:38,274" end="00:10:43,270">over the next 12 months and then update that on a regular basis.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:43,270" end="00:10:50,362">And to forecast out where you're actually going to be, as things evolve.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:50,362" end="00:10:53,338">And certainly cashflow forecasting is something quite different<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:10:53,338" end="00:10:57,038">and that's something that we would encourage clients to</p>
      <p begin="00:10:57,038" end="00:11:01,025">setup a weekly tool that sort of shows, what's coming in this week,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:01,025" end="00:11:05,201">what's going out, and try to forecast that out as far as possible.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:11:05,201" end="00:11:11,506">And have receipts and expenses which will show any cashflow hole,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:11,506" end="00:11:18,471">or a spot of difficulty, may be three, four, or six months down the track and really use it<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:11:18,471" end="00:11:22,392">as an early warning tool for cashflow difficulty.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:11:22,392" end="00:11:28,542">(Emily) Yeah and I would say that, my business partner and I, meet weekly to talk about cashflow and </p>
      <p begin="00:11:28,542" end="00:11:34,092">that's something that we've just established in the business. Every week we sit down and talk about, <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:11:34,092" end="00:11:38,337">"Okay, let's look at our cashflow", "Are there going to be any problems?"<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:11:38,337" end="00:11:43,795">"What's coming in; let's look at what's going out." Just to keep the focus on it and so that we're both </p>
      <p begin="00:11:43,795" end="00:11:51,628">really aware of where we're at. Otherwise it's not front of mind and that's when things get out of control.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:51,628" end="00:11:55,253">(Andrew) Yeah. Growing businesses, really, they need cash.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:55,253" end="00:12:02,920">So, that cashflow forecasting as opposed to an annual budget, is really important. So, just moving on to...<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:02,920" end="00:12:06,420">(Cara) Okay, sorry before you move on there, </p>
      <p begin="00:12:06,420" end="00:12:09,004">just Emily, people are still having trouble hearing you.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:09,004" end="00:12:13,588">So, if it's possible to speak more directly into the microphone.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:13,588" end="00:12:16,345">And I do have another question,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:16,345" end="00:12:20,267">which is from Hannah, who says, "We have suppliers who use Xerox,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:20,267" end="00:12:23,672">but they're mainly sole traders. Is it good for larger businesses?"<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:23,672" end="00:12:26,087">Hannah's currently using a spreadsheet<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:26,087" end="00:12:30,854">which shows 1200 customers and she wants to know, would Xerox support that?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:30,854" end="00:12:33,873">(Emily) Yes, definitely. </p>
      <p begin="00:12:33,873" end="00:12:40,002">(Andrew) Yeah. So, Hannah, great work on being able to</p>
      <p begin="00:12:40,002" end="00:12:44,541">manage a business of that size on a spreadsheet, I think that's fantastic.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:44,541" end="00:12:47,857">But, I think it is time to move to a automated system, Xerox,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:47,857" end="00:12:51,183">it's got a really good capability and<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:51,183" end="00:12:56,919">we have a number of clients on it, I mean Em's, your business is not a one-man show.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:12:56,919" end="00:12:57,928">(Emily) No.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:57,928" end="00:13:01,283">(Andrew) So, I think there are some limitations</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01,283" end="00:13:06,548">with the number of employees that can be on the base versions,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:13:06,548" end="00:13:13,851">but there's a whole lot of pluggins for payroll and stock management and project management,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:13:13,851" end="00:13:23,848">I'm a big rep for Xerox, I've got a lot of clients on it, my wife's business uses it, and what's your experience been with it Em?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:23,848" end="00:13:30,669">(Emily) I think that the best thing about Xerox is that you don't have to do be an accountant to use this, it's very user friendly.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:30,669" end="00:13:42,457">It's web based, so it's not like you need to buy software and can really get it updated, it's really quite easy to use.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:42,457" end="00:13:46,338">You don't really that much training once it's all set up.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:13:46,338" end="00:13:49,754">It just kind of runs itself.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:49,754" end="00:13:53,272">(Andrew) Yes, definitely. Very intuitive and very easy to use.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53,272" end="00:13:54,088">(Emily) Yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:54,088" end="00:13:57,931">(Andrew) MYOB, Quickbooks, Saasu, they're all good products.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:57,931" end="00:14:00,540">This is not an advertisement for Xerox,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:00,540" end="00:14:05,670">I guess for all of you lovers of MYOB and quickbooks out there,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:05,670" end="00:14:14,302">but certainly we both find it, very easy to use and it's automation is fantastic and saves a lot of time<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:14,302" end="00:14:20,450">and manual entry. So, moving on now.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:20,450" end="00:14:27,801">So, our top three issues that Em and I have come up with, for avoiding cashflow mistakes.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:27,801" end="00:14:31,866">Robust debtor management process, it's so important isn't it?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:31,866" end="00:14:32,943">(Emily) Yep definitely.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:32,943" end="00:14:38,439">(Andrew) And we'll talk more in detail about some examples of good process</p>
      <p begin="00:14:38,439" end="00:14:44,519">and give you some examples about how to deal with problem, problem payers.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:44,519" end="00:14:47,148">That cashflow planning and forecasting,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:47,148" end="00:14:51,194">we keep talking about that over and over and up to date financial information.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:51,270" end="00:14:57,296">It's no good waiting until September, October, or December, <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:14:57,296" end="00:15:01,603">after year end, when you get your tax return or your accounts from your accountant<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:15:01,603" end="00:15:06,411">to look to see how your business has been performing. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:15:06,411" end="00:15:09,353">That real-time information is absolutely critical.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:15:09,353" end="00:15:17,582">Cashflow, it's the outcome of the actions and the activities that happen in your business.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:15:17,582" end="00:15:20,301">So, we're actually in business to make money.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20,301" end="00:15:24,783">So, the output of that is ultimately cash in the bank<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:15:24,783" end="00:15:30,038">and if we're not monitoring the activities and the actions that we take in our business on a regular basis,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:15:30,038" end="00:15:39,289">then you're going to end up with cashflow problems, unless you're really lucky.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:15:39,289" end="00:15:44,954">(Emily) And I'll totally agree with that because unless you make a commitment to manage it, </p>
      <p begin="00:15:44,954" end="00:15:50,322">you overspend and you always think that you've got more money in the bank than you really do.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:50,322" end="00:15:57,897">(Cara) Okay, just another question on that front.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57,897" end="00:16:00,320">We've got a question from Rob McQueeny.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:00,320" end="00:16:03,375">And he says, "How can you protect yourself against bad debts,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:03,375" end="00:16:10,728">bad debt insurance is a percentage of the insured amount, as our margins are quite small and typically less than 18%"<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:10,728" end="00:16:14,900">(Andrew) Yeah. Rob, that's a good question.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:14,900" end="00:16:21,854">So, we've had some clients use debtor insurance before and it is expensive.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:21,854" end="00:16:29,482">That said, certainly one client, it paid for itself when a large debt<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:29,482" end="00:16:33,507">that was unpaid and the client went into liquidation. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:33,507" end="00:16:37,952">Other ways that you can protect yourself against bad debts<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:37,952" end="00:16:40,781">and we talk about this in the coming slides, <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:40,781" end="00:16:45,628">is having director's guarantees, making sure your contracts are right,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:45,628" end="00:16:56,746">using the PPSR and really, I guess, being clear on engaging, how you engage with clients up front.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:56,746" end="00:16:59,996">It's probably time move onto this next section<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:16:59,996" end="00:17:05,910">because this is where we talk about how to prevent customers from becoming late payers.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:17:05,910" end="00:17:12,966">And this is really also how you protect yourself from your debts.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:12,966" end="00:17:15,911">So, look I think debtor insurance, there's a place for it. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:17:15,911" end="00:17:18,496">It's not necessarily for all businesses.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:17:18,496" end="00:17:26,165"> If you're looking at using a factoring facility or debtor finance,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:17:26,165" end="00:17:29,521">then they certainly may require you to use debtor insurance,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:17:29,521" end="00:17:37,022">but I think there's some simple things that you can put in place, which we'll talk through in the next little while<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:17:37,022" end="00:17:42,722">to help to protect you against, against bad debts.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:17:42,722" end="00:17:49,843">So, in our tips for preventing customers becoming late payers<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:17:49,843" end="00:17:54,844">and even to follow on from Rob's question, becoming bad debts,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:17:54,844" end="00:18:00,323">are really things are on agreeing on your trading terms, signing off on your engagement letter, or<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:18:00,323" end="00:18:04,534">agreeing on a scope that works upfront, and choosing your customers really carefully,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:18:04,534" end="00:18:09,762">that's a critical one and we'll probably go into a bit more detail about that,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:09,762" end="00:18:15,777">asking for a deposit, invoicing regularly; now we see clients that complain that they've</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15,777" end="00:18:19,674">been unable to collect the debt and they've issued the invoice 3 or 4 months</p>
      <p begin="00:18:19,674" end="00:18:25,497">after the service was delivered, it's no wonder the client doesn't want to pay - sending an invoice out,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:18:25,497" end="00:18:30,567">90 days after the service is sort of indicating that it's not that important that you get paid.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:30,567" end="00:18:37,396">Credit checks and getting on issues early, and on the back of that, monitoring balances regularly.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:37,396" end="00:18:43,776">And so, what's your experience been Em, with signing off on engagements and<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:18:43,776" end="00:18:46,944">and agreeing engagements with clients up front.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:18:46,944" end="00:18:53,695">(Emily) Yep, that was something I had to learn because initially, we'd just go into the arrangement,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:53,695" end="00:18:56,373">without an engagement letter but</p>
      <p begin="00:18:56,373" end="00:18:59,953">now before we start any engagement, because we're a service based business,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:18:59,953" end="00:19:03,379">it's really important to get that letter signed off. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:03,379" end="00:19:09,316">And we normally ask for 50% up front and the other 50% when the work is complete,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:09,316" end="00:19:12,820">so that definitely has helped us manage our cashflow.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:12,820" end="00:19:16,283">We invoice regularly so we invoice at the end of the month.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:16,283" end="00:19:20,152">We used to just invoice whenever, but now we've got some rigour in that we</p>
      <p begin="00:19:20,152" end="00:19:23,427">we do it religiously at the end of the month.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:23,427" end="00:19:25,966">And everybody knows that on the first of the next month,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:25,966" end="00:19:27,912">they're going to get their invoice. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:27,927" end="00:19:29,488">So, that's really helped us.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:29,488" end="00:19:34,879">We have seven days payment terms and we get people to sign off on that<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:34,879" end="00:19:46,711">and the engagement letter and agree to our terms so find out how they're paying, so those things have really helped us manage our cashflow.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:46,711" end="00:19:48,019">(Andrew) So, on the deposit,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></p>
      <p begin="00:19:48,019" end="00:19:51,259">asking for a 50% deposit, how do customer's react to that?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:51,259" end="00:19:55,071">(Emily) It's amazing, most people say "yes, no problem."</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55,071" end="00:19:58,629">There are some people who, who try and get around it.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:19:58,629" end="00:20:01,297">But they're not really the types of customers that we want. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:20:01,297" end="00:20:07,590">A lot of the times there will be work involved in setting things up,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:20:07,590" end="00:20:13,009">we have to go out and buy things to do the job so we need the money up front and we just explain that to them<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:20:13,009" end="00:20:19,680">and they're generally very happy to pay 50% up front, but if they're not, I would advise to leave those one as<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:20:19,680" end="00:20:23,675"> they will be the ones who don't want to pay when they get their invoice anyway.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:23,675" end="00:20:31,614">(Andrew) So, choosing your customers carefully is a tip we've got up there to preventing customers</p>
      <p begin="00:20:31,614" end="00:20:35,079">&#160;from becoming late payers, so, what experience have you had in,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:20:35,079" end="00:20:38,057">have you always done that or did you learn the hard way?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:20:38,057" end="00:20:39,809">(Emily) No, I definitely learnt the hard way.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:39,809" end="00:20:43,891">Initially you accept any business, because you want the business,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:20:43,891" end="00:20:52,166">and then, now I can see alarm bells going off, if I see them going off I just won't work with that customer,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52,166" end="00:20:58,249">so it really is about picking your customers carefully and I was giving Andrew an example before <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:20:58,249" end="00:21:05,210">where I had a client that was a serial late payer, and now I don't do business with them any more because it just wasn't worth it.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:21:05,210" end="00:21:08,844">(Andrew) Yeah. It's really,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:08,844" end="00:21:14,081"> it sounds like its really about having confidence in your own ability, in your own service and the product.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:21:14,081" end="00:21:15,331">(Emily) Definitely.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:15,331" end="00:21:17,592">(Andrew) And having the ability to say no to potential business can be difficult.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:17,592" end="00:21:18,712">(Emily) Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:18,712" end="00:21:20,496">(Andrew) But, it can prevent a lot of issues down the track.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:20,496" end="00:21:23,451">(Emily) Yeah, well, I totally agree with that.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:23,451" end="00:21:26,025">(Cara) Okay, I've got another question for you. </p>
      <p begin="00:21:26,025" end="00:21:27,555">It's come from Sharon. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:21:27,555" end="00:21:31,542">She's a sole trader and wants to know should she have an engagement letter put together<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:21:31,542" end="00:21:37,688">and is that something she can write herself or does it need to be a legal document?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:21:37,688" end="00:21:42,432">(Andrew) That's a good question, Cara. </p>
      <p begin="00:21:42,432" end="00:21:47,236">And the, I think the answer probably varies.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:21:47,236" end="00:21:52,237">I think it probably depends on, you know, the type of work she's doing, the nature of it,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:21:52,237" end="00:21:54,033">how much money is involved.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:21:54,033" end="00:21:58,501">If they're, if they're big contracts and big engagements,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:21:58,501" end="00:22:02,117">I would think then that's probably worth getting some legal advice around it.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:02,117" end="00:22:04,820">But, if they're smaller engagements,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:04,820" end="00:22:07,903">then perhaps it's something that she could even draw up<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:07,903" end="00:22:10,700">together with her customers and clients,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:10,700" end="00:22:14,801">to say, well, these are the terms of the engagements<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:14,801" end="00:22:17,519">and this is what we're going to the deliver and this is what we expect from you.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:17,519" end="00:22:20,613">Em, what have you done with your engagement letters?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:20,613" end="00:22:23,670">(Emily) I actually used an engagement</p>
      <p begin="00:22:23,670" end="00:22:27,107"> letter that somebody had given me, one of my service providers,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:27,107" end="00:22:31,163">and I just changed it and adapted it so that I could use it for myself.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:31,163" end="00:22:37,997"> So, it's not a legal document, I'm a service based business so it's a little bit different, I imagine if you were </p>
      <p begin="00:22:37,997" end="00:22:47,761">a stock based business, it would probably need to be a little bit more in depth and complicated.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:47,761" end="00:22:56,311">So don't be afraid to plagiarise and steal hints from other people and make them your own, is my advice.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:56,311" end="00:22:57,462">(Andrew) Yeah. In small business, </p>
      <p begin="00:22:57,462" end="00:22:59,734">I think, that we've got to take a practical approach.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:22:59,734" end="00:23:03,537">I would say, Cara, our advice to Sharon would be,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:03,537" end="00:23:07,598">depending on the size of the, and nature of engagement,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:07,598" end="00:23:10,813">if they're complicated and there are large dollars involved,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:10,813" end="00:23:13,831">then it's certainly worth getting then getting some legal advice,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:13,831" end="00:23:17,521">but if they're, they're smaller contracts,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:17,521" end="00:23:20,842">I think, she could probably talk to them and maybe even draft things up<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:20,842" end="00:23:24,228"> with her customers so that they do them together.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:24,228" end="00:23:27,442">And take Em's advice and see if she can't find<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:27,442" end="00:23:31,049">engagement letter from, maybe even a service provider that you use Sharon.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:31,049" end="00:23:35,273">(Emily) And Sharon, Google is always great.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:35,273" end="00:23:39,182">Just type it in and you'll be amazed at what you can find online.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:39,182" end="00:23:45,568">There's hundreds of free templates available- so that's another option.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:45,568" end="00:23:47,912">(Cara) Okay. </p>
      <p begin="00:23:47,912" end="00:23:52,907">We've got another question, which is possibly airing on the side of legal advice, as well. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:52,907" end="00:23:57,576">But, this is from Amanda and she works in the Child Care industry.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:23:57,576" end="00:24:01,228">And she said they've had a parent who signed all the contracts and agreements,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>

      <p begin="00:24:07,118" end="00:24:09,239">(Emily) Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09,239" end="00:24:16,816">(Andrew) Yeah. I think, I think there's certainly, there's time when you've got to get advice</p>
      <p begin="00:24:16,816" end="00:24:18,419">and you have to get the right advice.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:24:18,419" end="00:24:22,069">And we can't give legal advice out here today. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:24:22,069" end="00:24:23,676">Cara, I don't know. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:24:23,676" end="00:24:28,489">You're not asking us to, but I think that's probably, that's probably the next step for Amanda,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:24:28,489" end="00:24:32,664">depending on, you know, the amount of dollars involved.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:32,664" end="00:24:36,471">The other thing she could do is refer it to a debt collection- a debt collector<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:24:36,471" end="00:24:38,849">or debt collection agency as well.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>

      <p begin="00:24:44,341" end="00:24:46,015">(Cara) Okay, great.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></p>
      <p begin="00:24:46,015" end="00:24:48,773">And I'll let you keep on moving before I ask some more questions.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>

      <p begin="00:24:57,692" end="00:25:04,471">choosing your customers carefully and that takes confidence, doesn't it?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:04,471" end="00:25:11,076">You've got to have faith in your own ability, your own product and service to say no to potential business.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:11,076" end="00:25:13,114">(Emily) Yeah. Definitely.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></p>
      <p begin="00:25:15,152" end="00:25:17,190">(Andrew) Agree your trading terms and your scope, in writing.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:17,190" end="00:25:18,267">Now, that's..<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:18,267" end="00:25:23,598">so many disputes can be avoided by having it in writing up front before you commence.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:23,598" end="00:25:24,792">(Emily) Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24,792" end="00:25:27,154">That's something that I definitely learnt the hard way.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:27,154" end="00:25:34,317">it's about having everything in writing, people revert to their own rules and generally, they're not in your favour.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:34,317" end="00:25:35,348">(Andrew) Definitely.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35,348" end="00:25:38,255">So, agree it in writing and finally,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:38,255" end="00:25:42,588">follow your debtor management process religiously.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:42,588" end="00:25:45,681">If you're gonna have a process, well there's no point having a process </p>
      <p begin="00:25:45,681" end="00:25:48,251">if you're not going to follow it.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:48,251" end="00:25:50,800">(Emily) And, you know, as a business owner this is not fun,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:50,800" end="00:25:55,603">and it's not something that I love doing but I've learned that I have to do it<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:25:55,603" end="00:26:00,076">because it's one of the most important things that you need to do day to day.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00,076" end="00:26:03,242">(Andrew) Yeah. Having a process no doubt, it helps that.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03,242" end="00:26:08,870">And so, looking at ways to deal with late paying customers. </p>
      <p begin="00:26:08,870" end="00:26:11,489">Again, there's a whole range of different things that we can do.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:26:11,489" end="00:26:17,266">These are the things that we thought were the most critical when it comes to<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:26:17,266" end="00:26:21,812">so, if we haven't been able educate them, and coach the customers and train them<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:26:21,812" end="00:26:28,603">by using those tips and techniques that we spoke of earlier, here are some ways that we can deal with late paying customers.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28,603" end="00:26:31,625">You've got to have a debtor system. <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:26:31,625" end="00:26:36,899">If you don't have a debtor system, you've got no real way of tracking them and having a follow up process,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:26:36,899" end="00:26:42,565">so it's amazing how quickly 90 days can fly, if you're not looking at your debtors and chasing payments.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42,565" end="00:26:45,569">Value your product and service, following the system,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:26:45,569" end="00:26:47,658">keep in close contact with your customers.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:26:47,658" end="00:26:49,970">I mean, everyone has a right to be paid.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:26:49,970" end="00:26:55,594">I think, if you value your product or service and remember that people<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:26:55,594" end="00:27:00,149">want to buy it, and usually they're, you know, if you do have debtors,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:00,149" end="00:27:03,023">you're in the trade and dealing with other businesses who are either<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:03,023" end="00:27:06,399">on-selling or in business themselves, they're looking to make money too.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:06,399" end="00:27:09,097">So, everyone has a right to be paid.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:09,097" end="00:27:14,627">And don't be afraid to ask for payment, we'll talk about that one in a sec.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:14,627" end="00:27:18,990">Get advice, use debt collectors, and train your staff<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:18,990" end="00:27:26,232"> in your processes, don't feel like you have to leave it up to yourself and asking customers to commit to an amount</p>
      <p begin="00:27:26,232" end="00:27:35,017">and date, and maybe using payment arrangements, if customers are having difficulty paying at that time.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:35,017" end="00:27:38,185">So, what's your experience, Em, in dealing with late payers?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:38,185" end="00:27:42,330">(Emily) My experience is that if you keep on top of it,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42,330" end="00:27:50,314">normally the person who is shouting the loudest will be the first to be paid.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:50,314" end="00:27:54,230">So, if you're not shouting, you will get pushed to the bottom of the queue, and I've learnt that.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:54,230" end="00:27:57,919">So, it's about emailing, communicating, <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:27:57,919" end="00:28:03,955">following it up with a phone call, and then if you get no response making sure that you send<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:28:03,955" end="00:28:10,064">a formal letter of demand and that seems to work extremely well.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:28:10,064" end="00:28:12,200">But, you need to be on top of it.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:28:12,200" end="00:28:14,590">You need to make sure that you're polite.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:28:14,590" end="00:28:19,731">If you're rude or forceful, they're not gonna respond very nicely to you.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:28:19,731" end="00:28:25,032">So, it's just about making sure that you follow your process, that you're courteous, build a relationship with<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:28:25,032" end="00:28:33,529">the accounts payable person, learn who you need to be speaking to because often that will help you get the result you want.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:33,529" end="00:28:35,764">(Andrew) So, do you like chasing debtors?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35,764" end="00:28:42,333">(Emily) Definitely not. It's not fun. But I learnt the hard way that I have to do it.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:42,333" end="00:28:48,054">So, I'm now very disciplined about making sure that I chase debtors,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:28:48,054" end="00:28:51,739">and initially it was probably very scary, ringing up and asking for money.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:51,739" end="00:28:58,904">But now I've done it a lot of times, you definitely get more comfortable and confident asking for money.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:28:58,904" end="00:28:59,941">(Andrew) Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:59,941" end="00:29:03,964">If you want to be in small business, it's just it's one of those jobs that no one likes doing.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:29:03,964" end="00:29:10,589">And unfortunately, you can't be in business without collecting your debtors.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:29:10,589" end="00:29:11,830">(Emily)That's right.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:11,830" end="00:29:14,661">(Cara) So, I've got a question on that topic from Tammy.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:14,661" end="00:29:20,475">She says their business involves trade, she's a trades person,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:29:20,475" end="00:29:23,571">so, most transactions are under $200.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:29:23,571" end="00:29:28,087">So, what would be a good way to inform lots of smaller customers of your<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:29:28,087" end="00:29:30,847">payment terms without putting them off your services?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:29:30,847" end="00:29:42,650">(Andrew) Yeah, so, I think, my sense is, and Em and I have spoken about this quite a bit today already,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42,650" end="00:29:46,882">you need to value your products and services, Tammy,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:29:46,882" end="00:29:52,173">And you need to just have confidence that people want to buy them.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:29:52,173" end="00:29:57,143">The other thing that might be, if you're worried that some people might leave</p>
      <p begin="00:29:57,143" end="00:29:59,974">or stop using your business,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:29:59,974" end="00:30:04,642">is, have a think about how much time you spend chasing debtors<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:04,642" end="00:30:08,976">and chasing money and try to quantify that.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:08,976" end="00:30:11,976">And then think about how much business you could afford to lose<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:11,976" end="00:30:14,106">before you're actually going backwards.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:14,106" end="00:30:19,559">The transactions under $200, I would even think about looking at<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:19,559" end="00:30:27,944">taking credit card payments at time of delivery or COD, or something like that.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:27,944" end="00:30:36,103">I think these days where there's low dollar amounts, where transactions are low dollar amounts,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:36,103" end="00:30:38,748">people are more and more used to paying up front,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:38,748" end="00:30:41,916">and paying for things not on credit,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:41,916" end="00:30:44,460">you can go to the doctor, it'll cost you $60 or $70,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:44,460" end="00:30:47,890">you're not allowed to put that on a 30 or a 60 day account.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:47,890" end="00:30:50,535">You go to the petrol station and fill your car up,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:50,535" end="00:30:53,035">that costs you a hundred bucks, you've got to pay it at that time.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:53,035" end="00:30:57,166">Your phone bill, yeah, look I'm sure everyone forgets to pay the bill,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:30:57,166" end="00:31:05,862">but we all know that pretty quickly after that the due date the phone companies will stop outgoing calls.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:05,862" end="00:31:11,265">So, I think customers, generally, particularly with smaller amounts,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:11,265" end="00:31:13,772">are used to having to pay that quickly, so I think<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:13,772" end="00:31:17,013">it comes down to having the confidence, changing the trading terms</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17,013" end="00:31:20,999">communicate it openly and that could be by letter or e-mail,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:20,999" end="00:31:23,654">or if you've got some customers that spend a lot with you<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:23,654" end="00:31:26,257">and you could certainly get on the phone or go and see them.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:26,257" end="00:31:34,016">Communicate it openly, communicate why you're doing it and have some confidence in your product and service.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:34,016" end="00:31:39,010">(Emily) And you can always buy one of those EFT machines</p>
      <p begin="00:31:39,010" end="00:31:46,437">that are wireless now. You can take that wherever you go so you're making people pay on that at the</p>
      <p begin="00:31:46,437" end="00:31:48,749">&#160;end of the job and doesn't give you an option.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:48,749" end="00:31:51,081">(Andrew) Yep, Yep, that's a great idea.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></p>
      <p begin="00:31:51,081" end="00:31:53,926">A wireless credit card machine,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:53,926" end="00:31:59,884">and back to the earlier comments, I think people expect to pay at the time of service,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:31:59,884" end="00:32:03,067">particularly for those smaller trades jobs.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:32:03,067" end="00:32:05,154">(Cara) We've got a question from James.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:05,154" end="00:32:09,402">Who wants to know, what's the difference between a Letter of Agreement and your terms?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:32:09,402" end="00:32:17,913">(Andrew) So I would say a Letter of Agreement, I think that James is probably</p>
      <p begin="00:32:17,913" end="00:32:22,976">talking about an Engagement Letter, and the scope, to say, these are the things we're going to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22,976" end="00:32:26,976">You know if you're a service business, this is what we're going to do<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:32:26,976" end="00:32:29,643">over what time frame and this is what you're going to do to help<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:32:29,643" end="00:32:34,475">deliver that service as a customer or a client, and these are the things we're going to do and these are the outcomes.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:34,475" end="00:32:43,347">If you're a trade or a whole sale or stock related business, this would be the</p>
      <p begin="00:32:43,347" end="00:32:46,029">things that we're going to deliver to you in what time frames and whatnot,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:32:46,029" end="00:32:50,057">so your commitments around the service, whereas your terms of trade are,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:32:50,057" end="00:32:58,224">we expect, you know 50% deposit and the balance 30 days from end of month, or seven days from invoice or whatnot.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:32:58,224" end="00:33:06,723">So I think there's certainly the engagement letter or how you do business and then your trading terms of how you expect to be paid.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:33:06,723" end="00:33:18,730">(Emily) Yep, my letter of engagement, actually includes the trading terms in it, because it's not a stock or wholesale business, </p>
      <p begin="00:33:18,730" end="00:33:27,200">so trading terms I think it would be more relevant for a bigger business in dealing with stock, but I think that it can include both.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:33:27,200" end="00:33:34,022">(Cara) Okay, one more question on this topic,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:34,022" end="00:33:37,338">how do you get around the fact that, -it's from Simone,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:33:37,338" end="00:33:39,426">and she wants to know how do you get around<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:33:39,426" end="00:33:42,893">the fact you're trading terms may be 14 days but the customer your dealing with<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:33:42,893" end="00:33:46,068">says they only pay at the end of the following month?<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:33:46,068" end="00:33:48,677">This does tend to be larger companies.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:33:48,677" end="00:33:55,012">I know from our readers, this is a real issue where, if you're a smaller business dealing with a larger business,<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:33:55,012" end="00:33:58,366">you may not have that much negotiating power.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> </p>
      <p begin="00:33:58,366" end="00:34:00,808">(Emily) Yeah and I've had that issue before, </p>
      <p begin="00:34:00,808" end="00:34:04,526">and I guess you need to make the call about whether</p>
      <p begin="00:34:04,526" end="00:34:08,408">you can afford to service that client because I work with clients</p>
      <p begin="00:34:08,408" end="00:34:12,560">and they make me sign up to their trading terms,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:12,560" end="00:34:17,810">they're bigger, and they can boss you around I guess and force you into doing that,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:17,810" end="00:34:24,399">and generally because they are a bigger corporate organisation you kind of have to suck it up.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:24,399" end="00:34:27,785">But I would try and avoid it at all costs.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:27,785" end="00:34:34,506">You know, think of work arounds, think of ways that they might be able to negotiate with you</p>
      <p begin="00:34:34,506" end="00:34:39,647">and explain why you need to do that, but sometimes I guess you have to</p>
      <p begin="00:34:39,647" end="00:34:44,200">make a call and decide if I agree on whether to do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:44,200" end="00:34:48,902">(Andrew) Yeah, I'd agree with Em there Cara. Simone, I think it's a decision you make as to</p>
      <p begin="00:34:48,902" end="00:34:52,462">who do you want to do business with, if you want to do </p>
      <p begin="00:34:52,462" end="00:34:56,440">business with corporates that in-flexible with their trading terms and only pay</p>
      <p begin="00:34:56,440" end="00:35:02,216">60 days or whatever it is, well that's a choice that you have to make, and if you don't want to </p>
      <p begin="00:35:02,216" end="00:35:05,570">do business with them then you back yourself to go and find the customers that</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05,570" end="00:35:11,906">you want to deal with, and for me it comes back to the phone example,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11,906" end="00:35:15,828">I'd love to pay my phone bill in 90 days but thats, </p>
      <p begin="00:35:15,828" end="00:35:21,619">I've been trained that that doesn't work. Look if you can't train the customer, </p>
      <p begin="00:35:21,619" end="00:35:24,619">not all customers can be trained, I think that's probably fair to say.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24,619" end="00:35:29,058">And then that becomes a decision as to whether you want to do business with that type of business.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:29,058" end="00:35:37,340">(Cara) Okay. And from Phil, we have a question, is there an example of a debtor management process</p>
      <p begin="00:35:37,340" end="00:35:39,838">which I think leads pretty perfectly onto your next slide.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:39,838" end="00:35:47,188">(Andrew) It sure does, so this is something that Em and I put together as an example</p>
      <p begin="00:35:47,188" end="00:35:56,406">of a debtor recovery process and there's some great templates and tips on the Business Victoria website,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:56,406" end="00:36:03,112">so, to start off, certainly getting the invoice out on time, send that with the goods</p>
      <p begin="00:36:03,112" end="00:36:10,385">or in line with the engagement letter, or the service agreement, don't wait for a month,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:10,385" end="00:36:15,341">send it out as soon as the goods have been delivered, or the services</p>
      <p begin="00:36:15,341" end="00:36:18,811">have been filled or send them out with the engagement letter or service agreement.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:18,811" end="00:36:22,873">Step 2 would be after sending the invoice, and not leaving it too late, is</p>
      <p begin="00:36:22,873" end="00:36:26,562">give your customer a call, make sure that they've got the invoice,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:26,562" end="00:36:29,923">make sure that they've got the goods or services</p>
      <p begin="00:36:29,923" end="00:36:35,777">and that there's no issues, confirm the payment terms and really, this helps to </p>
      <p begin="00:36:35,777" end="00:36:41,218">determine if there's any obstacles to receiving the payment, so it clears the way for the payment.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:41,218" end="00:36:49,205">It can be a customer service call, with a little hint of reminder around the trading terms,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:49,205" end="00:36:57,625">and the conversation might be along the lines of, you know, "Hi Em, you know we've finished your accounts for the year</p>
      <p begin="00:36:57,625" end="00:37:06,057">we sent the invoice out last week, is everything in order, no problems, good. If there's any issues let us know,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:06,057" end="00:37:13,677">we've had a look and we're happy with that, yep make sure its in your system, and remember the payment terms of 30 days.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:13,677" end="00:37:19,037">Can you see any issues with that Em, in terms of not been able to pay that on time?"</p>
      <p begin="00:37:19,037" end="00:37:24,853">So it's just a gently, softly customer service type call that clears the way for any</p>
      <p begin="00:37:24,853" end="00:37:31,757">obstacles for payment. Be proactive about getting issues out on the table,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:31,757" end="00:37:38,239">we certainly see quite often that, that aged debts often come with an issue</p>
      <p begin="00:37:38,239" end="00:37:43,348">either relate to the service or product, so the earlier you can deal with that issue,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43,348" end="00:37:47,343">the quicker you are going to be able to resolve it and get paid, don't wait for the customer to come to you, </p>
      <p begin="00:37:47,343" end="00:37:51,888">be proactive. Then once the account is sorted, if the account is overdue, </p>
      <p begin="00:37:51,888" end="00:37:55,884">then a follow up call or email or letter, again there are some great templates</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55,884" end="00:38:04,719">on the Business Victoria website, so that's around 7 days before the account is 7 days overdue. Another reminder</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04,719" end="00:38:13,959">something a little more firm, before its 14 days overdue, then once it hits 30 days and no later,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:13,959" end="00:38:19,361">something really firm like a final notice, outlining the consequences, if you don't receive payment by a certain date,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:19,361" end="00:38:30,713">then last day, a formal letter or instructing a solicitor or debt collection agency once your account is more than 30 days</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30,713" end="00:38:36,317.66666666651145">overdue. So that's an example, so the sorts of things that you do, Em, you use a similar process, so how do you find that works?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:41,921" end="00:38:47,527">(Emily) Yeah, so I've got a process, where initially I send a very friendly email if its overdue,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47,527" end="00:38:54,313">and I know its overdue becasue I am in Xerox everyday to see if people have paid or not,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54,313" end="00:38:58,673">and then if it's still not paid or I don't get a response, I send another email,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:58,673" end="00:39:05,242">then I would give them a call, and once again and make sure I'm speaking to the right person.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:05,242" end="00:39:10,982">Sometimes the accounts payable person is not the right person to be speaking to, you need to</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10,982" end="00:39:17,861">speak to the person in the company who actually engaged you, and let them know that it's not been paid</p>
      <p begin="00:39:17,861" end="00:39:24,778">and that you need them to sort it out. If you know the business owner, sometimes it's good to copy them in, and</p>
      <p begin="00:39:24,778" end="00:39:32,388">that will get things moving generally, sometimes if they just ignore you, which some people do,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32,388" end="00:39:41,262">making sure that you send a formal letter of demand, you don't have to use a debt collector, I've never used a debt collector because I can't afford to, </p>
      <p begin="00:39:41,262" end="00:39:49,060">so just saying, if you don't pay by this date, normally I give them 7 days, I'll be instructing my solicitor to take it further</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49,060" end="00:39:53,942">and you will have to pay not only the invoice, but costs as well. </p>
      <p begin="00:39:53,942" end="00:39:57,817">(Andrew) Yep, and what sort of response do you get from that approach once it gets to that stage?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57,817" end="00:40:04,497">(Emily) Oh, only twice have I ever had to give the formal letter of demand, generally it gets paid before that,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04,497" end="00:40:15,416">it generally works, because as I said before, the person who screams the loudest, will get paid, and I think that's a good common sense approach.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:15,416" end="00:40:22,032">(Andrew) Yeah, and relationships- like do you find that, I know often, businesses worry about damaging relationships</p>
      <p begin="00:40:22,032" end="00:40:29,328">they have with their customers and clients by asking for payments and issuing demands and those sorts of things, </p>
      <p begin="00:40:29,328" end="00:40:31,983">so how does that - what's your experience with that?</p>
      <p begin="00:40:31,983" end="00:40:37,240">(Emily) It's never impacted on a relationship, because I think it's about mutual respect</p>
      <p begin="00:40:37,240" end="00:40:44,246">because if I do a good job, and I provide a really good service then I should be allowed to get paid for it. </p>
      <p begin="00:40:44,246" end="00:40:52,081">And, also I'm always extremely courteous, friendly, never rude, I never raise my voice or get angry,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:52,081" end="00:41:00,578">although I feel like it sometimes obviously, it's just about being really respectful.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:00,578" end="00:41:06,113">(Andrew) Yeah, I think the other thing is when you're on the phone, if you are speaking to someone, be prepared</p>
      <p begin="00:41:06,113" end="00:41:09,532">to take a payment, or ask for a payment, then and there.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:09,532" end="00:41:13,199">(Emily) Exactly right, "So when can I expect payment, can you pay today?"</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13,199" end="00:41:22,030">If they say no I can't pay today, you say, when can you make the payment?" if they say tomorrow, then you check the next day to see</p>
      <p begin="00:41:22,030" end="00:41:26,570">if it's gone in, because a lot of the time people will say yes they will pay it, but then they don't</p>
      <p begin="00:41:26,570" end="00:41:33,289">and if you just let it just run out even more time will lapse, so it's really about following up</p>
      <p begin="00:41:33,289" end="00:41:41,031">and having the discipline to follow up, not being afraid to ask for even a half payment, </p>
      <p begin="00:41:41,031" end="00:41:46,186">so if you can't make the whole payment, can you pay half, and then when can I expect the rest?</p>
      <p begin="00:41:46,186" end="00:41:49,436">(Andrew) Yeah so setting up a payment plan can sometimes make it easier for the customer</p>
      <p begin="00:41:49,436" end="00:41:55,956">and having some cash, is surely better than having none and waiting another month, or 6 weeks.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55,956" end="00:41:57,521">(Emily) Yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:57,521" end="00:42:04,803">(Cara) We've got a tip as well, from one of our participants, Hayden who says</p>
      <p begin="00:42:04,803" end="00:42:09,904">one of the best ways he's found, is to ask the recalcitrant payer to ask if the're trading whilst insolvent,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:09,904" end="00:42:15,085">you then, say that you wouldn't want to refer them to Asic and surely they can find a way to pay your invoice. Usually it works.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:15,085" end="00:42:21,802">So that's a bit of a creative approach, but I like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:21,802" end="00:42:30,262">We've also got, a question from Paul, who is in the construction industry, and he says</p>
      <p begin="00:42:30,262" end="00:42:35,192">they're in line with the building and construction industry security of payment act, </p>
      <p begin="00:42:35,192" end="00:42:43,576">which entitles them to charge interest as per section 101 of the civil procedure act, which is approximately 9% </p>
      <p begin="00:42:43,576" end="00:42:50,779">for all overdue payments. And Paul wants to know if either of you have had any experience applying this?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:50,779" end="00:42:56,518">And if so, how did you do it successfully so that the client paid the principle and the interest?</p>
      <p begin="00:42:56,518" end="00:43:03,353">Now Emily, given that you're in HR, I doubt that you've had experience under the building and construction industry act,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:03,353" end="00:43:10,056">but perhaps this is something you have come across Andrew?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:10,056" end="00:43:12,888">(Andrew) Yeah, so generally Cara, and Paul, that's a good question,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:12,888" end="00:43:21,133">we've certainly had experience in charging interest and it certainly is not uncommon to build it into your</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21,133" end="00:43:27,805">terms and conditions as well, so there's nothing to stop you from, as long as you're disclosing it</p>
      <p begin="00:43:27,805" end="00:43:33,041">to your clients and customers that it's your intention that your going charge interest on</p>
      <p begin="00:43:33,041" end="00:43:37,375">overdue accounts at a certain rate, if they sign off on those terms and conditions,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:37,375" end="00:43:41,489">then they've agreed to the fact that they can be charged interest. So it's another thing</p>
      <p begin="00:43:41,489" end="00:43:46,112">to get paid interest, which I think is probably Paul's question,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:46,112" end="00:43:56,260">my sense is that its probably more of a stick than it is a money making scheme, in terms of</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56,260" end="00:44:08,009">using the interest to make some money. So it's not uncommon to, we certainly see clients</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08,009" end="00:44:11,850">that charge interest, they might put it on their statements and whatnot, but when a client</p>
      <p begin="00:44:11,850" end="00:44:16,579">pays within a certain period of time, they'll remit the interest or remove the interest,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:16,579" end="00:44:21,806">or use that as a lever to get payment sooner rather than later, so I think that's probably</p>
      <p begin="00:44:21,806" end="00:44:27,807">what we've seen, is that, you can use it as a leverage to get payment sooner if there's an interest accruing on it.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27,807" end="00:44:36,505">The other thing is that if it does turn nasty, and end up in legal action,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:36,505" end="00:44:44,549">if you've been charging interest, it makes it much easier to ask the courts to award the interest.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44,549" end="00:44:47,977">So that's certainly something that we've seen from our experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:47,977" end="00:44:53,019">That could apply to Paul's situation in the construction game.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:53,019" end="00:45:00,471">(Cara) Okay great, thanks for that. </p>
      <p begin="00:45:00,471" end="00:45:05,288">(Andrew) So, have you got any other questions Cara, or we'll play on?</p>
      <p begin="00:45:05,288" end="00:45:12,077">(Cara) I'll let you move onto your next slide, and then we've got a few more, but keep moving along and I can ask the next lot.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:12,077" end="00:45:22,829">(Andrew) So, really there, Em, we've got our top tips for dealing with late payers, developing a process, train your customers, so,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:22,829" end="00:45:29,560">it's amazing how quickly customers will learn that they've got to pay you within your trade terms</p>
      <p begin="00:45:29,560" end="00:45:34,004">otherwise they're going to get bombarded with phone calls and emails that take up their time, it's easier</p>
      <p begin="00:45:34,004" end="00:45:39,495">just to pay squeaky wheel, rather than hear it carry on month after month, so training your customers</p>
      <p begin="00:45:39,495" end="00:45:45,296">is really important and that can take time. Training your staff, so making sure that people are prepared </p>
      <p begin="00:45:45,296" end="00:45:52,833">to receive a payment, there's nothing worse than if you've been chasing a debt, and a client calls and you're out of the office</p>
      <p begin="00:45:52,833" end="00:46:00,212">and you end up playing phone tag, so, train your team to be ready to accept payment, always have your credit card machine,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:00,212" end="00:46:05,995"> or your bank details handy- whatever it is, how you best receive payments, train your staff</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05,995" end="00:46:11,702">in this process too. Particularly, if you're no good at this or really don't like it</p>
      <p begin="00:46:11,702" end="00:46:16,545">then you've got to find someone in your organisation, who can do it, and is prepared to do it, </p>
      <p begin="00:46:16,545" end="00:46:18,679">so train them accordingly.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18,679" end="00:46:25,537">Understanding your customers payment cycles, so that goes back to, if your customers all pay 60 days, and you're</p>
      <p begin="00:46:25,537" end="00:46:35,200">14 days, then you're in the wrong place, and you need to think long and hard about whether you want to continue to work for those type </p>
      <p begin="00:46:35,200" end="00:46:39,412">of customers or whether you change your business. </p>
      <p begin="00:46:39,412" end="00:46:46,676">Accurate and detailed records - how can you know what's overdue, if you haven't got good invoicing</p>
      <p begin="00:46:46,676" end="00:46:52,799">a good automated debtor management system, like Xerox or MYOB or something like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:52,799" end="00:46:57,383">So having accurate and detailed records, it's no good reconciling once a quarter,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:57,383" end="00:47:03,049">you've got to do it weekly, I think it's an absolute must, that you do it weekly.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:03,049" end="00:47:08,796">Follow up regularly, that squeaky wheel that we were talking about before, that's how the world works.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:08,796" end="00:47:16,287">So just some comments around training your staff, what's your experience been in that?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16,287" end="00:47:23,714">(Emily) Well I had to train myself, so it was a process of me learning how to do it,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:23,714" end="00:47:28,779">making it a priority, and I've said it a couple of times, being disciplined,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:28,779" end="00:47:33,143">because it's not something that I like doing, but I have to force myself to do it, </p>
      <p begin="00:47:33,143" end="00:47:37,364">and I think that's every small business owners biggest challenge,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:37,364" end="00:47:45,599">is that it's not my area of expertise, I'm not a finance person and I've had to become good at things that I've never been good at before.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:45,599" end="00:47:50,974">Which is challenging, but it's rewarding when it all comes together.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50,974" end="00:47:54,887">(Andrew) Yeah, and if you're a growing business, cash is the life float of your business,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54,887" end="00:47:59,844">so like it or not, you've got to deal with cashflow proactively, you've got to </p>
      <p begin="00:47:59,844" end="00:48:04,709">deal with debtor management proactively, otherwise you may not be in business very long.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:04,709" end="00:48:09,990">So all businesses out there that are listening, that are in a bit of growth phase, </p>
      <p begin="00:48:09,990" end="00:48:18,336">it's absolutely paramount that, if you don't have good record keeping system, a good debtor management process,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:18,336" end="00:48:24,301">that cashflow will continue to be, the bane of your life.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24,301" end="00:48:27,179">And we know, its the number one issue for our clients.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:27,179" end="00:48:33,966">So just, the last slide there is...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:33,966" end="00:48:39,970">(Cara) Just before we, sorry I was going to interrupt but I may as well let you give your</p>
      <p begin="00:48:39,970" end="00:48:44,260">top three tips for today and then we'll go through the rest of the questions.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:44,260" end="00:48:51,348">(Andrew) No worries. So, we've been banging on about it Em, but good accurate records,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:51,348" end="00:48:57,086">up to date records, it's an absolute must. Choosing your customers carefully,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:57,086" end="00:49:02,326">engage with them proactively, upfront, and train them,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:02,326" end="00:49:06,005">and having a good debtor system and discipline, </p>
      <p begin="00:49:06,005" end="00:49:11,333">and as a small business owner, no doubt you find that you've got plenty of excuses as to why</p>
      <p begin="00:49:11,333" end="00:49:14,241">you shouldn't pick up the phone or send that email to chase the debtors,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:14,241" end="00:49:16,775">but you've got to have that discipline to follow the process.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16,775" end="00:49:25,134">(Emily) Yep, I totally agree, it's not fun, but it's part of my day to day operations now.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:25,134" end="00:49:31,542">(Andrew) Yeah, a big part of business. So, there's some great tips and advice on the Business Victoria website,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:31,542" end="00:49:38,826">with how to manage cashflow and deal with getting paid on time. So some great tips</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38,826" end="00:49:40,743">and templates and whatnot.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:40,743" end="00:49:46,274">(Emily) And scripts as well, about what to say, because I think that's quite scary to some people,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:46,274" end="00:49:53,250">is how do I do this, how do I have a conversation I don't want to damage my relationship - there's some</p>
      <p begin="00:49:53,250" end="00:49:56,911">great scripts on there to show you how to do it.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:56,911" end="00:50:01,971">(Andrew) Fantastic. So head to the Business website. So Cara, some more questions?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:01,971" end="00:50:07,578">(Cara) Yes we definitely have quite a few more questions and thanks everyone for the great</p>
      <p begin="00:50:07,578" end="00:50:12,118">questions you've been sending through. A few questions on the topic of interest, so</p>
      <p begin="00:50:12,118" end="00:50:19,201">Sonia says, she's found that what works is when she puts on her invoices that she charges 2.5%</p>
      <p begin="00:50:19,201" end="00:50:24,576">so that's a good tip from Sonia, but we've got a question from James,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:24,576" end="00:50:31,543">who wants to know, what would a reasonable interest amount be, to charge clients on their outstanding balances?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:31,543" end="00:50:44,561">(Andrew) Oh, James it's really what you think is reasonable. So I mean, we've certainly seen it, a recent example there was 2.5%</p>
      <p begin="00:50:44,561" end="00:50:50,223">and we've seen it as high as 18 - 19%, so pick something you're comfortable with, </p>
      <p begin="00:50:50,223" end="00:50:57,726">if it's too low people might see it as cheap finance, so you're not in the business of financing your customers,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:57,726" end="00:51:07,199">so I think it's got to be high enough so that it's a stick and a disincentive for people to hold you out.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:07,199" end="00:51:13,685">The flipside of that, which we haven't talked about, is early payment incentives and discounts</p>
      <p begin="00:51:13,685" end="00:51:18,082">so that's another stick on one side being interest, and an early payment discount on the other side,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:18,082" end="00:51:21,198">is another good way.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:21,198" end="00:51:28,417">(Cara) Okay, and I guess actually leading right onto that, Kerry Anne wants to know</p>
      <p begin="00:51:28,417" end="00:51:31,433">is it reasonable to ask for a 50% upfront payment?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:31,433" end="00:51:38,058">(Emily) Yeah, definitely, that's what I do in my business, is I ask for 50% up front and the other</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38,058" end="00:51:43,256">50% when the job is completed. And I think that is more than reasonable.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:43,256" end="00:51:46,646">(Andrew) Yeah, I think you've just got to know your market.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:46,646" end="00:51:56,534">Some people will be able to charge upfront, everything, some people might only accept 30%.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:56,534" end="00:52:01,269">And you might train your customers that where the industry has a 10% deposit, you might train them to be 50%.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:01,269" end="00:52:06,421">So I think it depends on your business and your market, but as Em has experienced,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:06,421" end="00:52:10,257">50% in her game, works.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:10,257" end="00:52:18,346">(Cara) So Martin suggests charging, what you're paying on your overdraft plus an overhead for admin.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:18,346" end="00:52:20,170">That's how he works it out.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:20,170" end="00:52:22,826">(Andrew) Great formula Martin, great formula.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22,826" end="00:52:29,274">(Cara) He'd make sure he's not out of pocket there. And Sonia has a tip as well, she says on the topic</p>
      <p begin="00:52:29,274" end="00:52:36,364">of training customers, she's changed her statements so they read 'current and overdue' rather than</p>
      <p begin="00:52:36,364" end="00:52:47,136">'current 30, 60 and 90,' so it's really taking out that next step or possiblity.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:47,136" end="00:52:52,266">(Andrew) Yep, it's also, great, great thinking there.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:52,266" end="00:53:03,682">(Cara) So in the debtor management process slide, we've just got a question about that from Frank,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03,682" end="00:53:11,712">and he says, at which step do you say, no further supplies or services until payment of the outstanding debt is made.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:11,712" end="00:53:15,963">When would you put your foot down, to that extent?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:15,963" end="00:53:22,606">(Emily) Well that's a good question, I guess it's case by case, it depends on how much</p>
      <p begin="00:53:22,606" end="00:53:28,979">they've got outstanding, I have definitely put people on hold that I know I'm not doing anymore</p>
      <p begin="00:53:28,979" end="00:53:34,866">business with you until you pay your account. I think that when it gets to a point</p>
      <p begin="00:53:34,866" end="00:53:39,721">when its over 30 days overdue, that that's when I would say no more.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:39,721" end="00:53:45,869">(Andrew) Yeah and I think that that's a pretty good place to start. If they're your</p>
      <p begin="00:53:45,869" end="00:53:54,638">largest customer and you can see a way forward and they're communicating with you openly</p>
      <p begin="00:53:54,638" end="00:53:59,766">and they're making some payments and you feel confident that their cashflow issues </p>
      <p begin="00:53:59,766" end="00:54:04,663">are short term, then you might decide to ride it out with them. </p>
      <p begin="00:54:04,663" end="00:54:13,915">But if you can't see a way forward, then I think the earlier you stop supply, the better.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:13,915" end="00:54:21,266">(Cara) Yep, okay, we've got a question from Cameron and he wants to know</p>
      <p begin="00:54:21,266" end="00:54:25,066">what you do in the situation where an administrator or receiver is appointed, </p>
      <p begin="00:54:25,066" end="00:54:31,683">if you're a unsecured creditor, what are your obligations to support the company under administration?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:31,683" end="00:54:39,722">(Andrew) Yeah, that's a really good question Cameron, so it probably depends on how much you're owed,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:39,722" end="00:54:47,623">so if you're owed a lot of money and it's going to cause you severe difficulties then I would be</p>
      <p begin="00:54:47,623" end="00:54:52,587">very proactive with the administrator in terms of doing what you can to help through.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:52,587" end="00:54:59,447">If you're owed a small amount, then and you can afford to write it off or whatnot,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:59,447" end="00:55:05,595">I think you probably, history would say, those smaller creditors unsecured don't get paid</p>
      <p begin="00:55:05,595" end="00:55:10,420">in those circumstances, it's very unlikely and you can spend a lot of time and effort</p>
      <p begin="00:55:10,420" end="00:55:19,989">chasing a small payment when that time and effort could be spent chasing new business or better servicing your </p>
      <p begin="00:55:19,989" end="00:55:26,858">good customers who pay on time. So I think it's a question as to what impact is it going to have</p>
      <p begin="00:55:26,858" end="00:55:34,569">on your business and how much time is it going to take to chase down a payment,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:34,569" end="00:55:38,805">and the trade off - where else could that time be better spent?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:38,805" end="00:55:45,909">(Cara) Okay great, thanks Andrew. I've got a question from Johnno, he runs a computer repair business</p>
      <p begin="00:55:45,909" end="00:55:50,904">in regional Victoria and he said he's got a couple of customers which he didn't have a</p>
      <p begin="00:55:50,904" end="00:55:55,497">written agreement with, can he still go through the recovery process? </p>
      <p begin="00:55:55,497" end="00:56:02,431">(Andrew) Yeah, I think even without a written agreement, there's no reason why</p>
      <p begin="00:56:02,431" end="00:56:06,191">if you've supplied a product or services, and you've got evidence of that,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06,191" end="00:56:14,288">there's no reason why you can't chase the debt, and there's also no reason why if you haven't had a written </p>
      <p begin="00:56:14,288" end="00:56:19,730">agreement with a customer, you can't put one in for future activities, just becuase you've been dealing with</p>
      <p begin="00:56:19,730" end="00:56:24,176">someone for the last 5 years on a handshake, doesn't mean you can't go to them and say, look, </p>
      <p begin="00:56:24,176" end="00:56:28,943">we've been doing this on a handshake, let's formalise this a bit because it will be good for you, </p>
      <p begin="00:56:28,943" end="00:56:31,331">and it will be good for us.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:31,331" end="00:56:37,032">(Emily) I think that a letter of demand, normally gets people moving, or else not</p>
      <p begin="00:56:37,032" end="00:56:43,608">from a solicitor, they go, oh okay this is getting serious now, so it's a formal message</p>
      <p begin="00:56:43,608" end="00:56:49,453">that looks a little bit scarier than just the normal email or phone call.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:49,453" end="00:56:54,196">So I would advise that, that would be step one.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:54,196" end="00:56:57,960">And then if that doesn't work, then actually going and finding a solicitor who's going</p>
      <p begin="00:56:57,960" end="00:57:05,075">to send them a letter, because there's nothing like a solicitors letterhead to scare people.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:05,075" end="00:57:12,840">(Cara) Okay. Brian wants to know has sending those letters of demand lost you any customers?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:12,840" end="00:57:16,193">(Emily) No, never. </p>
      <p begin="00:57:16,193" end="00:57:25,445">(Cara) That's good to hear, the process does work. A few final tips from our listeners.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:25,445" end="00:57:32,906">We've got Marie-Claire, she only asks for 50% deposits from big companies that might be able to get around the </p>
      <p begin="00:57:32,906" end="00:57:38,190">14 day trading terms, so that's one suggestion. And another one from Andra, who says</p>
      <p begin="00:57:38,190" end="00:57:47,627">she charges a $25 statement fee for all accounts over 30 days. And that scares</p>
      <p begin="00:57:47,627" end="00:57:53,033">a lot of people into paying. So they're both good tips there.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:53,033" end="00:57:57,998">But we should finish things up there, because we are coming up to the end of our hour,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57,998" end="00:58:04,109">so I know that all of you listening have got businesses to run and things to do, </p>
      <p begin="00:58:04,109" end="00:58:10,119">and so do our presenters, so I would really like to thank our two presenters,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:10,119" end="00:58:15,785">who have really been so generous with their time and expertise today, Andrew and Emily,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:15,785" end="00:58:22,529">we've really appreciated that, and special thanks to our partner for today's webinar Business Victoria.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:22,529" end="00:58:28,138">As you've heard during the seminar, their website is really a wealth of information</p>
      <p begin="00:58:28,138" end="00:58:33,905">for all of this sort of information, so it's a really good resource to go to, </p>
      <p begin="00:58:33,905" end="00:58:40,066">www.business.vic.gov.au and it's got templates on there and tips.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:40,066" end="00:58:44,760">So thank you very much everyone for your time and stay tuned for the next</p>
      <p begin="00:58:44,760" end="00:58:51,282">Smart Company webinar, there's another one coming up in the next week or so.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:51,282" end="00:58:57,106">Thanks Emily and Andrew.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:57,106" end="00:59:01,106">(Emily)Thank you. (Andrew) Thanks Cara.</p>
