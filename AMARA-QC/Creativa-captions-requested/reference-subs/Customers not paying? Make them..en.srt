00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Cara) Good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,699
and welcome to Smart Company’s first webinar of the year

3
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:14,883
which is “How to Deal With Customers Who Won’t Pay”

4
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:20,587
which I think you'll agree is a pretty important topic for all SME’s

5
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:24,837
My name is Cara Waters. I’m the editor of Smart Company

6
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:31,102
and today I’m joined with- virtually, because they are in different place to me,

7
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:38,034
but, Andrew Baird who is a principal in Accounting and Business Advisory at WHK

8
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:44,481
and Emily Jaksch whose title is 
Head Guru at HR Gurus.

9
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:51,013
So for the webinar, if you haven’t logged into one of these before,

10
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:55,857
just to let you know the way to participate is, firstly by listening.

11
00:00:55,857 --> 00:01:00,502
The audio will automatically be streamed through your computer speakers,

12
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:05,259
and another way is via Twitter.

13
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:12,638
So you can use the @SmartCompany or the #smartcowebinar.

14
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:19,764
Now, the major way though if you want to get really interactive

15
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:24,421
is to ask questions via the questions pane, which is,

16
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:26,754
you’ll see on your computer screen.

17
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,821
What you do is you type in your questions

18
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:32,224
in the space at bottom and click on send.

19
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:35,172
I’ll then be asking our two presenters

20
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:38,261
Andrew and Emily all your queries.

21
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:42,695
So, I really encourage you to send them through because it is an,

22
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:45,266
important topic and something

23
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:49,757
that I’m sure a lot of you do have questions about.

24
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:53,496
And, also, I'd just like to thank our partners for today’s webinar,

25
00:01:57,235 --> 00:02:00,976
who are, which is Business Victoria,

26
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:04,477
providing Big Help for Small Business.

27
00:02:04,477 --> 00:02:09,213
And one final reminder before I hand over to Andrew and Emily is that,

28
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,458
you don’t have to worry about furiously copying down notes

29
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:19,022
because we will send you copy of the slides to the webinar

30
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:22,824
and recording of the webinar as well.

31
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:25,766
So, you can relax a little bit.

32
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:28,039
or feel free to take notes if you want to.

33
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,516
So, I'll now hand over and to let them introduce

34
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:34,920
themselves properly, to Andrew and Emily.

35
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,074
(Andrew) Great. Thanks Cara. My name is Andrew Baird.

36
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:47,921
I'm a principal with WHK Accountants and Advisors, and we specialise in providing accounting and advisory services to the SME market.

37
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:54,967
(Emily) And my name is Emily Jaksch and I'm also with the SME market and run a HR consultancy.

38
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,694
(Andrew) And today, Emily and I are going to be talking to you about

39
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:05,858
how we deal with customers who won't pay. And it's all the key areas we're going to cover off today.

40
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:11,783
First of all we're going to be talking about key cashflow issues,

41
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:17,122
that affect businesses.

42
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:22,864
How to avoid common cashflow mistakes, and tips for preventing customers

43
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:28,526
becoming late payers, and ways to deal with late paying customers.

44
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:34,055
And as Cara said in the introduction please, we're more than happy to

45
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:36,624
take questions throughout the presentation as we go along.

46
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:42,026
So make sure you get tapping as topics that come up or questions come up.

47
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:47,887
Emily and I, we're more than happy to take those questions from you throughout the presentation.

48
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:54,260
So, really quickly, there's so many causes of cashflow issues, in business.

49
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:00,970
Unplanned capital purchases, debtors not paying, not managing your stock,

50
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,004
over spending, lack of systems and processes, too much bank debt,

51
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:09,328
inefficient operations, poor planning, poor record keeping,

52
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:11,714
and not managing the creditors properly.

53
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:13,538
The list could go on and on.

54
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:16,221
Em, as a business owner, what are some of the things that

55
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:22,863
you've experienced that have been key causes of cash flow issues, and financials.

56
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,588
(Emily) I guess the key to issue is not having a process.

57
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:30,503
If you don't focus on it everyday, it just kind of gets away from you.

58
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:37,920
So that's probably the biggest thing I have learnt
as a small business owner, is that you need to have a clear process,

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,185
a good invoicing process, good relationships, and that you follow that through.

60
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:46,426
(Andrew) Yes, so a far bit of planning involved in keeping on top of cashflow?

61
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:47,816
(Emily) Yes, definitely.

62
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:48,921
(Andrew) Yeah.

63
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:55,170
And so as a business which provides services to other SME's and large corporates,

64
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,254
so would debtors be a key issue for you?

65
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:06,681
(Emily) It is a big issue for us. We've got our debtor day down to 14 days, which is really good,

66
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:13,539
but that's only because we're on top of it every single day. I used to have a manual spreadsheet that I would use.

67
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:18,355
Now I use Xerox which is really good.

68
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:22,046
Its automated the whole process, so there's no double entry involved.

69
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:27,086
Now, we veered away from that, it's been really good for our cash flow.

70
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:31,028
(Andrew) Yeah. So, if we just move on, even I,

71
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:35,588
we could get top three causes of cash flow issues in small businesses.

72
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:41,171
It's really poor debtor management, lack of planning, and poor record keeping.

73
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:44,192
Those are what we see, and it's certainly what you've experienced

74
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:46,921
(Emily) Sure definitely.

75
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:50,276
(Andrew) So, moving now, how to avoid...

76
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,735
(Cara) Andrew and Emily, sorry, sorry to interrupt there.

77
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:53,891
We're just getting feedback,

78
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:56,724
people are having trouble listening to you.

79
00:05:56,724 --> 00:06:00,786
Are you able to speak into the microphone as we were, as we were doing before?

80
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:04,670
Apologies everyone.

81
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,088
(Andrew) That's okay, let's see how we go now.

82
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,925
So, let's talk about how we can...

83
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:13,689
(Cara) It's better from my end. So, yes, we're getting confirmation.

84
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,672
People are preferring that.

85
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,921
And Emily as well, when it's your turn,

86
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:21,154
if you just speak, speak better, more clearly into the microphone.

87
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:22,753
Thank you.

88
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:24,586
(Andrew) Sorry. So, let's have a chat Em

89
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,899
about how we can avoid some of these cashflow mistakes.

90
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,850
Some of the things and the tips that we've come up with here are

91
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,296
making sure there's clear roles and responsibilities in the business,

92
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:41,399
good stock management, good reporting, regular cash flow forecasting,

93
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,875
refinancing early, customer selections, choosing your customers,

94
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:51,361
having a really good systems and processes around debtor management.

95
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:57,504
Real-time information, Em, you mentioned before that you were using spreadsheets to manage your business.

96
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:58,551
(Emily) Yeah.

97
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,049
(Andrew) And, so, tell us a little bit about that

98
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:04,338
and what prompted you to move to Xerox.

99
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:10,504
(Emily) Sure. So, initially, I was using a spreadsheet to look at when people pay.

100
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:17,194
If they haven't paid me, if the invoices were overdue, I would start going through a processing of emailing them,

101
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:24,695
and calling them, which was a lot of work because you had to switch between your bank statement,

102
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:29,691
or online banking and the spreadsheet, which didn't make sense at all.

103
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:32,503
And then my accountant introduced me to Xerox,

104
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:40,210
which is a fantastic tool because it gives you real-time information because it links through to your bank statement.

105
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,605
So, you can very easily see who hasn't paid,

106
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:50,420
and everyday you can be on top of it, which is really important in my reports.

107
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:57,752
On debtor day, you have a really good idea of who your offenders are, which is also really helpful.

108
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:01,170
(Andrew) So, you can do all your invoicing through Xerox and you automatically,

109
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,280
(Emily) Yep,

110
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,196
(Andrew) you can see without having to go to the bank who's paid and who hasn't.

111
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:08,851
(Emily) Exactly. It's like, so everyday you reconcile your account.

112
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:12,540
Through the link to your bank statement so you can see

113
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,861
what money is going out, coming in, and whether it's overdue.

114
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:23,133
You can also send follow up invoices through that system to the people who aren't paying.

115
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,814
(Andrew) So, it really makes cash flow management, and cash flow planning,

116
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:28,088
and debtors really front line, is that..?

117
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:29,671
(Emily) Definitely.

118
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,965
(Andrew) Yeah, yep. One thing that we see,

119
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:36,633
and we've got it noted up there on the slides, is raising finance early with cashflow forecasting.

120
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:41,102
And see, a lot of businesses that come to us and haven't done adequate planning,

121
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:45,877
and are looking to raise finance when it's often too late.

122
00:08:45,877 --> 00:08:51,139
So, that cashflow forecasting and regular forecasting is so important.

123
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:54,792
Often it's too late by the time you realize

124
00:08:54,792 --> 00:09:02,094
that you're in a cashflow.. a bit of cashflow difficulty, it's too late to be going to the bank and asking for more money.

125
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:10,117
(Emily) Yep, I'll totally agree, I think that initially as a small business owner it's probably not everybody's skillset,

126
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:18,279
is managing finance. So it's something that you'll want to put off, and then you realise how much it impacts on everything that you're doing

127
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:26,786
but you need to focus on this, this is really important, and I hear from lots of business owners that this is one of the

128
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:34,474
key reasons that businesses fail, is a lack of cashflow management, so definitely forecast and be prepared

129
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:41,004
and not bury your head in the sand, pretending that things will get better, is paramount.

130
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:43,003
(Andrew) Absolutely, having the right information...

131
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:47,503
(Cara) I've got one question for the two of you already that's coming from Jan.

132
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,588
Jan wants to know what's the difference between a budget and a forecast.

133
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:54,840
(Andrew) That's a good question, Jan.

134
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,646
For me, and if I'll answer it, let me go first on this.

135
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:06,024
For me, a budget is something that we would see a business doing it, at the start of the year,

136
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:13,624
and really setting the goals for maybe the next 12 months or maybe even as far out as

137
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:20,788
maybe 3 years and using it as a tool to track the performance of the business.

138
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,253
That's setting yourself a good 12-month goal.

139
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:26,528
A forecast, we would say, is something you update more reguarly.

140
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:33,348
So, we would encourage our clients to do a budget, probably sometime between now and June.

141
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:38,274
So, they've got a clear picture of where they want the business to be

142
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:43,270
over the next 12 months and then update that on a regular basis.

143
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:50,362
And to forecast out where you're actually going to be, as things evolve.

144
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:53,338
And certainly cashflow forecasting is something quite different

145
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:57,038
and that's something that we would encourage clients to

146
00:10:57,038 --> 00:11:01,025
setup a weekly tool that sort of shows, what's coming in this week,

147
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:05,201
what's going out, and try to forecast that out as far as possible.

148
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:11,506
And have receipts and expenses which will show any cashflow hole,

149
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:18,471
or a spot of difficulty, may be three, four, or six months down the track and really use it

150
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:22,392
as an early warning tool for cashflow difficulty.

151
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:28,542
(Emily) Yeah and I would say that, my business partner and I, meet weekly to talk about cashflow and

152
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:34,092
that's something that we've just established in the business. Every week we sit down and talk about,

153
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:38,337
"Okay, let's look at our cashflow", "Are there going to be any problems?"

154
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:43,795
"What's coming in; let's look at what's going out." Just to keep the focus on it and so that we're both

155
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:51,628
really aware of where we're at. Otherwise it's not front of mind and that's when things get out of control.

156
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,253
(Andrew) Yeah. Growing businesses, really, they need cash.

157
00:11:55,253 --> 00:12:02,920
So, that cashflow forecasting as opposed to an annual budget, is really important. So, just moving on to...

158
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,420
(Cara) Okay, sorry before you move on there,

159
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,004
just Emily, people are still having trouble hearing you.

160
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:13,588
So, if it's possible to speak more directly into the microphone.

161
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:16,345
And I do have another question,

162
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:20,267
which is from Hannah, who says, "We have suppliers who use Xerox,

163
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:23,672
but they're mainly sole traders. Is it good for larger businesses?"

164
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:26,087
Hannah's currently using a spreadsheet

165
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:30,854
which shows 1200 customers and she wants to know, would Xerox support that?

166
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:33,873
(Emily) Yes, definitely.

167
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:40,002
(Andrew) Yeah. So, Hannah, great work on being able to

168
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:44,541
manage a business of that size on a spreadsheet, I think that's fantastic.

169
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,857
But, I think it is time to move to a automated system, Xerox,

170
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:51,183
it's got a really good capability and

171
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:56,919
we have a number of clients on it, I mean Em's, your business is not a one-man show.

172
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,928
(Emily) No.

173
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:01,283
(Andrew) So, I think there are some limitations

174
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:06,548
with the number of employees that can be on the base versions,

175
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:13,851
but there's a whole lot of pluggins for payroll and stock management and project management,

176
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:23,848
I'm a big rep for Xerox, I've got a lot of clients on it, my wife's business uses it, and what's your experience been with it Em?

177
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:30,669
(Emily) I think that the best thing about Xerox is that you don't have to do be an accountant to use this, it's very user friendly.

178
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:42,457
It's web based, so it's not like you need to buy software and can really get it updated, it's really quite easy to use.

179
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:46,338
You don't really that much training once it's all set up.

180
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:49,754
It just kind of runs itself.

181
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:53,272
(Andrew) Yes, definitely. Very intuitive and very easy to use.

182
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:54,088
(Emily) Yes.

183
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:57,931
(Andrew) MYOB, Quickbooks, Saasu, they're all good products.

184
00:13:57,931 --> 00:14:00,540
This is not an advertisement for Xerox,

185
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,670
I guess for all of you lovers of MYOB and quickbooks out there,

186
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:14,302
but certainly we both find it, very easy to use and it's automation is fantastic and saves a lot of time

187
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:20,450
and manual entry. So, moving on now.

188
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:27,801
So, our top three issues that Em and I have come up with, for avoiding cashflow mistakes.

189
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:31,866
Robust debtor management process, it's so important isn't it?

190
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:32,943
(Emily) Yep definitely.

191
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:38,439
(Andrew) And we'll talk more in detail about some examples of good process

192
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:44,519
and give you some examples about how to deal with problem, problem payers.

193
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,148
That cashflow planning and forecasting,

194
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:51,194
we keep talking about that over and over and up to date financial information.

195
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:57,296
It's no good waiting until September, October, or December,

196
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,603
after year end, when you get your tax return or your accounts from your accountant

197
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:06,411
to look to see how your business has been performing.

198
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:09,353
That real-time information is absolutely critical.

199
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:17,582
Cashflow, it's the outcome of the actions and the activities that happen in your business.

200
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:20,301
So, we're actually in business to make money.

201
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:24,783
So, the output of that is ultimately cash in the bank

202
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:30,038
and if we're not monitoring the activities and the actions that we take in our business on a regular basis,

203
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:39,289
then you're going to end up with cashflow problems, unless you're really lucky.

204
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:44,954
(Emily) And I'll totally agree with that because unless you make a commitment to manage it,

205
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:50,322
you overspend and you always think that you've got more money in the bank than you really do.

206
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:57,897
(Cara) Okay, just another question on that front.

207
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:00,320
We've got a question from Rob McQueeny.

208
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,375
And he says, "How can you protect yourself against bad debts,

209
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:10,728
bad debt insurance is a percentage of the insured amount, as our margins are quite small and typically less than 18%"

210
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:14,900
(Andrew) Yeah. Rob, that's a good question.

211
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:21,854
So, we've had some clients use debtor insurance before and it is expensive.

212
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:29,482
That said, certainly one client, it paid for itself when a large debt

213
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:33,507
that was unpaid and the client went into liquidation.

214
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:37,952
Other ways that you can protect yourself against bad debts

215
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:40,781
and we talk about this in the coming slides,

216
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:45,628
is having director's guarantees, making sure your contracts are right,

217
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:56,746
using the PPSR and really, I guess, being clear on engaging, how you engage with clients up front.

218
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:59,996
It's probably time move onto this next section

219
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:05,910
because this is where we talk about how to prevent customers from becoming late payers.

220
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:12,966
And this is really also how you protect yourself from your debts.

221
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,911
So, look I think debtor insurance, there's a place for it.

222
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,496
It's not necessarily for all businesses.

223
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:26,165
If you're looking at using a factoring facility or debtor finance,

224
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:29,521
then they certainly may require you to use debtor insurance,

225
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:37,022
but I think there's some simple things that you can put in place, which we'll talk through in the next little while

226
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:42,722
to help to protect you against, against bad debts.

227
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:49,843
So, in our tips for preventing customers becoming late payers

228
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:54,844
and even to follow on from Rob's question, becoming bad debts,

229
00:17:54,844 --> 00:18:00,323
are really things are on agreeing on your trading terms, signing off on your engagement letter, or

230
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:04,534
agreeing on a scope that works upfront, and choosing your customers really carefully,

231
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:09,762
that's a critical one and we'll probably go into a bit more detail about that,

232
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:15,777
asking for a deposit, invoicing regularly; now we see clients that complain that they've

233
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:19,674
been unable to collect the debt and they've issued the invoice 3 or 4 months

234
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:25,497
after the service was delivered, it's no wonder the client doesn't want to pay - sending an invoice out,

235
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:30,567
90 days after the service is sort of indicating that it's not that important that you get paid.

236
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:37,396
Credit checks and getting on issues early, and on the back of that, monitoring balances regularly.

237
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:43,776
And so, what's your experience been Em, with signing off on engagements and

238
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:46,944
and agreeing engagements with clients up front.

239
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:53,695
(Emily) Yep, that was something I had to learn because initially, we'd just go into the arrangement,

240
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:56,373
without an engagement letter but

241
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:59,953
now before we start any engagement, because we're a service based business,

242
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:03,379
it's really important to get that letter signed off.

243
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:09,316
And we normally ask for 50% up front and the other 50% when the work is complete,

244
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,820
so that definitely has helped us manage our cashflow.

245
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,283
We invoice regularly so we invoice at the end of the month.

246
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:20,152
We used to just invoice whenever, but now we've got some rigour in that we

247
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:23,427
we do it religiously at the end of the month.

248
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,966
And everybody knows that on the first of the next month,

249
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,912
they're going to get their invoice.

250
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:29,488
So, that's really helped us.

251
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:34,879
We have seven days payment terms and we get people to sign off on that

252
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:46,711
and the engagement letter and agree to our terms so find out how they're paying, so those things have really helped us manage our cashflow.

253
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:48,019
(Andrew) So, on the deposit,

254
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:51,259
asking for a 50% deposit, how do customer's react to that?

255
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:55,071
(Emily) It's amazing, most people say "yes, no problem."

256
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:58,629
There are some people who, who try and get around it.

257
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:01,297
But they're not really the types of customers that we want.

258
00:20:01,297 --> 00:20:07,590
A lot of the times there will be work involved in setting things up,

259
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:13,009
we have to go out and buy things to do the job so we need the money up front and we just explain that to them

260
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:19,680
and they're generally very happy to pay 50% up front, but if they're not, I would advise to leave those one as

261
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,675
they will be the ones who don't want to pay when they get their invoice anyway.

262
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:31,614
(Andrew) So, choosing your customers carefully is a tip we've got up there to preventing customers

263
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:35,079
from becoming late payers, so, what experience have you had in,

264
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,057
have you always done that or did you learn the hard way?

265
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:39,809
(Emily) No, I definitely learnt the hard way.

266
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,891
Initially you accept any business, because you want the business,

267
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:52,166
and then, now I can see alarm bells going off, if I see them going off I just won't work with that customer,

268
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:58,249
so it really is about picking your customers carefully and I was giving Andrew an example before

269
00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:05,210
where I had a client that was a serial late payer, and now I don't do business with them any more because it just wasn't worth it.

270
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,844
(Andrew) Yeah. It's really,

271
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:14,081
it sounds like its really about having confidence in your own ability, in your own service and the product.

272
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:15,331
(Emily) Definitely.

273
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:17,592
(Andrew) And having the ability to say no to potential business can be difficult.

274
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:18,712
(Emily) Yeah.

275
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,496
(Andrew) But, it can prevent a lot of issues down the track.

276
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:23,451
(Emily) Yeah, well, I totally agree with that.

277
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:26,025
(Cara) Okay, I've got another question for you.

278
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:27,555
It's come from Sharon.

279
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:31,542
She's a sole trader and wants to know should she have an engagement letter put together

280
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:37,688
and is that something she can write herself or does it need to be a legal document?

281
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:42,432
(Andrew) That's a good question, Cara.

282
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:47,236
And the, I think the answer probably varies.

283
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:52,237
I think it probably depends on, you know, the type of work she's doing, the nature of it,

284
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:54,033
how much money is involved.

285
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:58,501
If they're, if they're big contracts and big engagements,

286
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:02,117
I would think then that's probably worth getting some legal advice around it.

287
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:04,820
But, if they're smaller engagements,

288
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,903
then perhaps it's something that she could even draw up

289
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:10,700
together with her customers and clients,

290
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,801
to say, well, these are the terms of the engagements

291
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,519
and this is what we're going to the deliver and this is what we expect from you.

292
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,613
Em, what have you done with your engagement letters?

293
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:23,670
(Emily) I actually used an engagement

294
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:27,107
letter that somebody had given me, one of my service providers,

295
00:22:27,107 --> 00:22:31,163
and I just changed it and adapted it so that I could use it for myself.

296
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:37,997
So, it's not a legal document, I'm a service based business so it's a little bit different, I imagine if you were

297
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:47,761
a stock based business, it would probably need to be a little bit more in depth and complicated.

298
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:56,311
So don't be afraid to plagiarise and steal hints from other people and make them your own, is my advice.

299
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:57,462
(Andrew) Yeah. In small business,

300
00:22:57,462 --> 00:22:59,734
I think, that we've got to take a practical approach.

301
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:03,537
I would say, Cara, our advice to Sharon would be,

302
00:23:03,537 --> 00:23:07,598
depending on the size of the, and nature of engagement,

303
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:10,813
if they're complicated and there are large dollars involved,

304
00:23:10,813 --> 00:23:13,831
then it's certainly worth getting then getting some legal advice,

305
00:23:13,831 --> 00:23:17,521
but if they're, they're smaller contracts,

306
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,842
I think, she could probably talk to them and maybe even draft things up

307
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:24,228
with her customers so that they do them together.

308
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:27,442
And take Em's advice and see if she can't find

309
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:31,049
engagement letter from, maybe even a service provider that you use Sharon.

310
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:35,273
(Emily) And Sharon, Google is always great.

311
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:39,182
Just type it in and you'll be amazed at what you can find online.

312
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:45,568
There's hundreds of free templates available- so that's another option.

313
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:47,912
(Cara) Okay.

314
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:52,907
We've got another question, which is possibly airing on the side of legal advice, as well.

315
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:57,576
But, this is from Amanda and she works in the Child Care industry.

316
00:23:57,576 --> 00:24:01,228
And she said they've had a parent who signed all the contracts and agreements,

317
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:05,049
and now refuses to pay as he said English is not his first language

318
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:07,118
and he never understood what he was signing.

319
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:09,239
(Emily) Okay.

320
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:16,816
(Andrew) Yeah. I think, I think there's certainly, there's time when you've got to get advice

321
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:18,419
and you have to get the right advice.

322
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,069
And we can't give legal advice out here today.

323
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,676
Cara, I don't know.

324
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:28,489
You're not asking us to, but I think that's probably, that's probably the next step for Amanda,

325
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:32,664
depending on, you know, the amount of dollars involved.

326
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:36,471
The other thing she could do is refer it to a debt collection- a debt collector

327
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:38,849
or debt collection agency as well.

328
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:44,341
So...

329
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:46,015
(Cara) Okay, great.

330
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:48,773
And I'll let you keep on moving before I ask some more questions.

331
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:50,823
(Andrew) No worries.

332
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:57,692
And so, if we move on, Em, our top three tips for preventing late payers,

333
00:24:57,692 --> 00:25:04,471
choosing your customers carefully and that takes confidence, doesn't it?

334
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:11,076
You've got to have faith in your own ability, your own product and service to say no to potential business.

335
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,114
(Emily) Yeah. Definitely.

336
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:17,190
(Andrew) Agree your trading terms and your scope, in writing.

337
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,267
Now, that's..

338
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:23,598
so many disputes can be avoided by having it in writing up front before you commence.

339
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:24,792
(Emily) Yeah.

340
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:27,154
That's something that I definitely learnt the hard way.

341
00:25:27,154 --> 00:25:34,317
it's about having everything in writing, people revert to their own rules and generally, they're not in your favour.

342
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:35,348
(Andrew) Definitely.

343
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:38,255
So, agree it in writing and finally,

344
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:42,588
follow your debtor management process religiously.

345
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:45,681
If you're gonna have a process, well there's no point having a process

346
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:48,251
if you're not going to follow it.

347
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:50,800
(Emily) And, you know, as a business owner this is not fun,

348
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,603
and it's not something that I love doing but I've learned that I have to do it

349
00:25:55,603 --> 00:26:00,076
because it's one of the most important things that you need to do day to day.

350
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:03,242
(Andrew) Yeah. Having a process no doubt, it helps that.

351
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:08,870
And so, looking at ways to deal with late paying customers.

352
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,489
Again, there's a whole range of different things that we can do.

353
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:17,266
These are the things that we thought were the most critical when it comes to

354
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:21,812
so, if we haven't been able educate them, and coach the customers and train them

355
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:28,603
by using those tips and techniques that we spoke of earlier, here are some ways that we can deal with late paying customers.

356
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:31,625
You've got to have a debtor system.

357
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:36,899
If you don't have a debtor system, you've got no real way of tracking them and having a follow up process,

358
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:42,565
so it's amazing how quickly 90 days can fly, if you're not looking at your debtors and chasing payments.

359
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:45,569
Value your product and service, following the system,

360
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,658
keep in close contact with your customers.

361
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:49,970
I mean, everyone has a right to be paid.

362
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,594
I think, if you value your product or service and remember that people

363
00:26:55,594 --> 00:27:00,149
want to buy it, and usually they're, you know, if you do have debtors,

364
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:03,023
you're in the trade and dealing with other businesses who are either

365
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:06,399
on-selling or in business themselves, they're looking to make money too.

366
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:09,097
So, everyone has a right to be paid.

367
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:14,627
And don't be afraid to ask for payment, we'll talk about that one in a sec.

368
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:18,990
Get advice, use debt collectors, and train your staff

369
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:26,232
in your processes, don't feel like you have to leave it up to yourself and asking customers to commit to an amount

370
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:35,017
and date, and maybe using payment arrangements, if customers are having difficulty paying at that time.

371
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:38,185
So, what's your experience, Em, in dealing with late payers?

372
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:42,330
(Emily) My experience is that if you keep on top of it,

373
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:50,314
normally the person who is shouting the loudest will be the first to be paid.

374
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:54,230
So, if you're not shouting, you will get pushed to the bottom of the queue, and I've learnt that.

375
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,919
So, it's about emailing, communicating,

376
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,955
following it up with a phone call, and then if you get no response making sure that you send

377
00:28:03,955 --> 00:28:10,064
a formal letter of demand and that seems to work extremely well.

378
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,200
But, you need to be on top of it.

379
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,590
You need to make sure that you're polite.

380
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,731
If you're rude or forceful, they're not gonna respond very nicely to you.

381
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:25,032
So, it's just about making sure that you follow your process, that you're courteous, build a relationship with

382
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:33,529
the accounts payable person, learn who you need to be speaking to because often that will help you get the result you want.

383
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,764
(Andrew) So, do you like chasing debtors?

384
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:42,333
(Emily) Definitely not. It's not fun. But I learnt the hard way that I have to do it.

385
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:48,054
So, I'm now very disciplined about making sure that I chase debtors,

386
00:28:48,054 --> 00:28:51,739
and initially it was probably very scary, ringing up and asking for money.

387
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:58,904
But now I've done it a lot of times, you definitely get more comfortable and confident asking for money.

388
00:28:58,904 --> 00:28:59,941
(Andrew) Yeah.

389
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:03,964
If you want to be in small business, it's just it's one of those jobs that no one likes doing.

390
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:10,589
And unfortunately, you can't be in business without collecting your debtors.

391
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:11,830
(Emily)That's right.

392
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,661
(Cara) So, I've got a question on that topic from Tammy.

393
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:20,475
She says their business involves trade, she's a trades person,

394
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:23,571
so, most transactions are under $200.

395
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:28,087
So, what would be a good way to inform lots of smaller customers of your

396
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:30,847
payment terms without putting them off your services?

397
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:42,650
(Andrew) Yeah, so, I think, my sense is, and Em and I have spoken about this quite a bit today already,

398
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,882
you need to value your products and services, Tammy,

399
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:52,173
And you need to just have confidence that people want to buy them.

400
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:57,143
The other thing that might be, if you're worried that some people might leave

401
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:59,974
or stop using your business,

402
00:29:59,974 --> 00:30:04,642
is, have a think about how much time you spend chasing debtors

403
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:08,976
and chasing money and try to quantify that.

404
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,976
And then think about how much business you could afford to lose

405
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,106
before you're actually going backwards.

406
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:19,559
The transactions under $200, I would even think about looking at

407
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:27,944
taking credit card payments at time of delivery or COD, or something like that.

408
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:36,103
I think these days where there's low dollar amounts, where transactions are low dollar amounts,

409
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:38,748
people are more and more used to paying up front,

410
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:41,916
and paying for things not on credit,

411
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:44,460
you can go to the doctor, it'll cost you $60 or $70,

412
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,890
you're not allowed to put that on a 30 or a 60 day account.

413
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,535
You go to the petrol station and fill your car up,

414
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:53,035
that costs you a hundred bucks, you've got to pay it at that time.

415
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:57,166
Your phone bill, yeah, look I'm sure everyone forgets to pay the bill,

416
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:05,862
but we all know that pretty quickly after that the due date the phone companies will stop outgoing calls.

417
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:11,265
So, I think customers, generally, particularly with smaller amounts,

418
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:13,772
are used to having to pay that quickly, so I think

419
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:17,013
it comes down to having the confidence, changing the trading terms

420
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:20,999
communicate it openly and that could be by letter or e-mail,

421
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:23,654
or if you've got some customers that spend a lot with you

422
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:26,257
and you could certainly get on the phone or go and see them.

423
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:34,016
Communicate it openly, communicate why you're doing it and have some confidence in your product and service.

424
00:31:34,016 --> 00:31:39,010
(Emily) And you can always buy one of those EFT machines

425
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:46,437
that are wireless now. You can take that wherever you go so you're making people pay on that at the

426
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,749
end of the job and doesn't give you an option.

427
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:51,081
(Andrew) Yep, Yep, that's a great idea.

428
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:53,926
A wireless credit card machine,

429
00:31:53,926 --> 00:31:59,884
and back to the earlier comments, I think people expect to pay at the time of service,

430
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:03,067
particularly for those smaller trades jobs.

431
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:05,154
(Cara) We've got a question from James.

432
00:32:05,154 --> 00:32:09,402
Who wants to know, what's the difference between a Letter of Agreement and your terms?

433
00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:17,913
(Andrew) So I would say a Letter of Agreement, I think that James is probably

434
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:22,976
talking about an Engagement Letter, and the scope, to say, these are the things we're going to do.

435
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:26,976
You know if you're a service business, this is what we're going to do

436
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:29,643
over what time frame and this is what you're going to do to help

437
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:34,475
deliver that service as a customer or a client, and these are the things we're going to do and these are the outcomes.

438
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:43,347
If you're a trade or a whole sale or stock related business, this would be the

439
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:46,029
things that we're going to deliver to you in what time frames and whatnot,

440
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:50,057
so your commitments around the service, whereas your terms of trade are,

441
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:58,224
we expect, you know 50% deposit and the balance 30 days from end of month, or seven days from invoice or whatnot.

442
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:06,723
So I think there's certainly the engagement letter or how you do business and then your trading terms of how you expect to be paid.

443
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:18,730
(Emily) Yep, my letter of engagement, actually includes the trading terms in it, because it's not a stock or wholesale business,

444
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:27,200
so trading terms I think it would be more relevant for a bigger business in dealing with stock, but I think that it can include both.

445
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:34,022
(Cara) Okay, one more question on this topic,

446
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:37,338
how do you get around the fact that, -it's from Simone,

447
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:39,426
and she wants to know how do you get around

448
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:42,893
the fact you're trading terms may be 14 days but the customer your dealing with

449
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:46,068
says they only pay at the end of the following month?

450
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,677
This does tend to be larger companies.

451
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:55,012
I know from our readers, this is a real issue where, if you're a smaller business dealing with a larger business,

452
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:58,366
you may not have that much negotiating power.

453
00:33:58,366 --> 00:34:00,808
(Emily) Yeah and I've had that issue before,

454
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:04,526
and I guess you need to make the call about whether

455
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:08,408
you can afford to service that client because I work with clients

456
00:34:08,408 --> 00:34:12,560
and they make me sign up to their trading terms,

457
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,810
they're bigger, and they can boss you around I guess and force you into doing that,

458
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:24,399
and generally because they are a bigger corporate organisation you kind of have to suck it up.

459
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,785
But I would try and avoid it at all costs.

460
00:34:27,785 --> 00:34:34,506
You know, think of work arounds, think of ways that they might be able to negotiate with you

461
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:39,647
and explain why you need to do that, but sometimes I guess you have to

462
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:44,200
make a call and decide if I agree on whether to do that.

463
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,902
(Andrew) Yeah, I'd agree with Em there Cara. Simone, I think it's a decision you make as to

464
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:52,462
who do you want to do business with, if you want to do

465
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:56,440
business with corporates that in-flexible with their trading terms and only pay

466
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:02,216
60 days or whatever it is, well that's a choice that you have to make, and if you don't want to

467
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:05,570
do business with them then you back yourself to go and find the customers that

468
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,906
you want to deal with, and for me it comes back to the phone example,

469
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:15,828
I'd love to pay my phone bill in 90 days but thats,

470
00:35:15,828 --> 00:35:21,619
I've been trained that that doesn't work. Look if you can't train the customer,

471
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,619
not all customers can be trained, I think that's probably fair to say.

472
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:29,058
And then that becomes a decision as to whether you want to do business with that type of business.

473
00:35:29,058 --> 00:35:37,340
(Cara) Okay. And from Phil, we have a question, is there an example of a debtor management process

474
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,838
which I think leads pretty perfectly onto your next slide.

475
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:47,188
(Andrew) It sure does, so this is something that Em and I put together as an example

476
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:56,406
of a debtor recovery process and there's some great templates and tips on the Business Victoria website,

477
00:35:56,406 --> 00:36:03,112
so, to start off, certainly getting the invoice out on time, send that with the goods

478
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:10,385
or in line with the engagement letter, or the service agreement, don't wait for a month,

479
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:15,341
send it out as soon as the goods have been delivered, or the services

480
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:18,811
have been filled or send them out with the engagement letter or service agreement.

481
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:22,873
Step 2 would be after sending the invoice, and not leaving it too late, is

482
00:36:22,873 --> 00:36:26,562
give your customer a call, make sure that they've got the invoice,

483
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:29,923
make sure that they've got the goods or services

484
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:35,777
and that there's no issues, confirm the payment terms and really, this helps to

485
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:41,218
determine if there's any obstacles to receiving the payment, so it clears the way for the payment.

486
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:49,205
It can be a customer service call, with a little hint of reminder around the trading terms,

487
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:57,625
and the conversation might be along the lines of, you know, "Hi Em, you know we've finished your accounts for the year

488
00:36:57,625 --> 00:37:06,057
we sent the invoice out last week, is everything in order, no problems, good. If there's any issues let us know,

489
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:13,677
we've had a look and we're happy with that, yep make sure its in your system, and remember the payment terms of 30 days.

490
00:37:13,677 --> 00:37:19,037
Can you see any issues with that Em, in terms of not been able to pay that on time?"

491
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:24,853
So it's just a gently, softly customer service type call that clears the way for any

492
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:31,757
obstacles for payment. Be proactive about getting issues out on the table,

493
00:37:31,757 --> 00:37:38,239
we certainly see quite often that, that aged debts often come with an issue

494
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:43,348
either relate to the service or product, so the earlier you can deal with that issue,

495
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:47,343
the quicker you are going to be able to resolve it and get paid, don't wait for the customer to come to you,

496
00:37:47,343 --> 00:37:51,888
be proactive. Then once the account is sorted, if the account is overdue,

497
00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:55,884
then a follow up call or email or letter, again there are some great templates

498
00:37:55,884 --> 00:38:04,719
on the Business Victoria website, so that's around 7 days before the account is 7 days overdue. Another reminder

499
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:13,959
something a little more firm, before its 14 days overdue, then once it hits 30 days and no later,

500
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:19,361
something really firm like a final notice, outlining the consequences, if you don't receive payment by a certain date,

501
00:38:19,361 --> 00:38:30,713
then last day, a formal letter or instructing a solicitor or debt collection agency once your account is more than 30 days

502
00:38:30,713 --> 00:38:36,317
overdue. So that's an example, so the sorts of things that you do, Em, you use a similar process, so how do you find that works?

503
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:47,527
(Emily) Yeah, so I've got a process, where initially I send a very friendly email if its overdue,

504
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:54,313
and I know its overdue becasue I am in Xerox everyday to see if people have paid or not,

505
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:58,673
and then if it's still not paid or I don't get a response, I send another email,

506
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:05,242
then I would give them a call, and once again and make sure I'm speaking to the right person.

507
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:10,982
Sometimes the accounts payable person is not the right person to be speaking to, you need to

508
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:17,861
speak to the person in the company who actually engaged you, and let them know that it's not been paid

509
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:24,778
and that you need them to sort it out. If you know the business owner, sometimes it's good to copy them in, and

510
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:32,388
that will get things moving generally, sometimes if they just ignore you, which some people do,

511
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:41,262
making sure that you send a formal letter of demand, you don't have to use a debt collector, I've never used a debt collector because I can't afford to,

512
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:49,060
so just saying, if you don't pay by this date, normally I give them 7 days, I'll be instructing my solicitor to take it further

513
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:53,942
and you will have to pay not only the invoice, but costs as well.

514
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:57,817
(Andrew) Yep, and what sort of response do you get from that approach once it gets to that stage?

515
00:39:57,817 --> 00:40:04,497
(Emily) Oh, only twice have I ever had to give the formal letter of demand, generally it gets paid before that,

516
00:40:04,497 --> 00:40:15,416
it generally works, because as I said before, the person who screams the loudest, will get paid, and I think that's a good common sense approach.

517
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:22,032
(Andrew) Yeah, and relationships- like do you find that, I know often, businesses worry about damaging relationships

518
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:29,328
they have with their customers and clients by asking for payments and issuing demands and those sorts of things,

519
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:31,983
so how does that - what's your experience with that?

520
00:40:31,983 --> 00:40:37,240
(Emily) It's never impacted on a relationship, because I think it's about mutual respect

521
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:44,246
because if I do a good job, and I provide a really good service then I should be allowed to get paid for it.

522
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:52,081
And, also I'm always extremely courteous, friendly, never rude, I never raise my voice or get angry,

523
00:40:52,081 --> 00:41:00,578
although I feel like it sometimes obviously, it's just about being really respectful.

524
00:41:00,578 --> 00:41:06,113
(Andrew) Yeah, I think the other thing is when you're on the phone, if you are speaking to someone, be prepared

525
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:09,532
to take a payment, or ask for a payment, then and there.

526
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:13,199
(Emily) Exactly right, "So when can I expect payment, can you pay today?"

527
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:22,030
If they say no I can't pay today, you say, when can you make the payment?" if they say tomorrow, then you check the next day to see

528
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:26,570
if it's gone in, because a lot of the time people will say yes they will pay it, but then they don't

529
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:33,289
and if you just let it just run out even more time will lapse, so it's really about following up

530
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:41,031
and having the discipline to follow up, not being afraid to ask for even a half payment,

531
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:46,186
so if you can't make the whole payment, can you pay half, and then when can I expect the rest?

532
00:41:46,186 --> 00:41:49,436
(Andrew) Yeah so setting up a payment plan can sometimes make it easier for the customer

533
00:41:49,436 --> 00:41:55,956
and having some cash, is surely better than having none and waiting another month, or 6 weeks.

534
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:57,521
(Emily) Yes.

535
00:41:57,521 --> 00:42:04,803
(Cara) We've got a tip as well, from one of our participants, Hayden who says

536
00:42:04,803 --> 00:42:09,904
one of the best ways he's found, is to ask the recalcitrant payer to ask if the're trading whilst insolvent,

537
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:15,085
you then, say that you wouldn't want to refer them to Asic and surely they can find a way to pay your invoice. Usually it works.

538
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:21,802
So that's a bit of a creative approach, but I like that.

539
00:42:21,802 --> 00:42:30,262
We've also got, a question from Paul, who is in the construction industry, and he says

540
00:42:30,262 --> 00:42:35,192
they're in line with the building and construction industry security of payment act,

541
00:42:35,192 --> 00:42:43,576
which entitles them to charge interest as per section 101 of the civil procedure act, which is approximately 9%

542
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:50,779
for all overdue payments. And Paul wants to know if either of you have had any experience applying this?

543
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:56,518
And if so, how did you do it successfully so that the client paid the principle and the interest?

544
00:42:56,518 --> 00:43:03,353
Now Emily, given that you're in HR, I doubt that you've had experience under the building and construction industry act,

545
00:43:03,353 --> 00:43:10,056
but perhaps this is something you have come across Andrew?

546
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:12,888
(Andrew) Yeah, so generally Cara, and Paul, that's a good question,

547
00:43:12,888 --> 00:43:21,133
we've certainly had experience in charging interest and it certainly is not uncommon to build it into your

548
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:27,805
terms and conditions as well, so there's nothing to stop you from, as long as you're disclosing it

549
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:33,041
to your clients and customers that it's your intention that your going charge interest on

550
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:37,375
overdue accounts at a certain rate, if they sign off on those terms and conditions,

551
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:41,489
then they've agreed to the fact that they can be charged interest. So it's another thing

552
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:46,112
to get paid interest, which I think is probably Paul's question,

553
00:43:46,112 --> 00:43:56,260
my sense is that its probably more of a stick than it is a money making scheme, in terms of

554
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:08,009
using the interest to make some money. So it's not uncommon to, we certainly see clients

555
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:11,850
that charge interest, they might put it on their statements and whatnot, but when a client

556
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,579
pays within a certain period of time, they'll remit the interest or remove the interest,

557
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:21,806
or use that as a lever to get payment sooner rather than later, so I think that's probably

558
00:44:21,806 --> 00:44:27,807
what we've seen, is that, you can use it as a leverage to get payment sooner if there's an interest accruing on it.

559
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:36,505
The other thing is that if it does turn nasty, and end up in legal action,

560
00:44:36,505 --> 00:44:44,549
if you've been charging interest, it makes it much easier to ask the courts to award the interest.

561
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,977
So that's certainly something that we've seen from our experience.

562
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:53,019
That could apply to Paul's situation in the construction game.

563
00:44:53,019 --> 00:45:00,471
(Cara) Okay great, thanks for that.

564
00:45:00,471 --> 00:45:05,288
(Andrew) So, have you got any other questions Cara, or we'll play on?

565
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:12,077
(Cara) I'll let you move onto your next slide, and then we've got a few more, but keep moving along and I can ask the next lot.

566
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:22,829
(Andrew) So, really there, Em, we've got our top tips for dealing with late payers, developing a process, train your customers, so,

567
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:29,560
it's amazing how quickly customers will learn that they've got to pay you within your trade terms

568
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,004
otherwise they're going to get bombarded with phone calls and emails that take up their time, it's easier

569
00:45:34,004 --> 00:45:39,495
just to pay squeaky wheel, rather than hear it carry on month after month, so training your customers

570
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:45,296
is really important and that can take time. Training your staff, so making sure that people are prepared

571
00:45:45,296 --> 00:45:52,833
to receive a payment, there's nothing worse than if you've been chasing a debt, and a client calls and you're out of the office

572
00:45:52,833 --> 00:46:00,212
and you end up playing phone tag, so, train your team to be ready to accept payment, always have your credit card machine,

573
00:46:00,212 --> 00:46:05,995
or your bank details handy- whatever it is, how you best receive payments, train your staff

574
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:11,702
in this process too. Particularly, if you're no good at this or really don't like it

575
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:16,545
then you've got to find someone in your organisation, who can do it, and is prepared to do it,

576
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:18,679
so train them accordingly.

577
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:25,537
Understanding your customers payment cycles, so that goes back to, if your customers all pay 60 days, and you're

578
00:46:25,537 --> 00:46:35,200
14 days, then you're in the wrong place, and you need to think long and hard about whether you want to continue to work for those type

579
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,412
of customers or whether you change your business.

580
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:46,676
Accurate and detailed records - how can you know what's overdue, if you haven't got good invoicing

581
00:46:46,676 --> 00:46:52,799
a good automated debtor management system, like Xerox or MYOB or something like that.

582
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:57,383
So having accurate and detailed records, it's no good reconciling once a quarter,

583
00:46:57,383 --> 00:47:03,049
you've got to do it weekly, I think it's an absolute must, that you do it weekly.

584
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:08,796
Follow up regularly, that squeaky wheel that we were talking about before, that's how the world works.

585
00:47:08,796 --> 00:47:16,287
So just some comments around training your staff, what's your experience been in that?

586
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:23,714
(Emily) Well I had to train myself, so it was a process of me learning how to do it,

587
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:28,779
making it a priority, and I've said it a couple of times, being disciplined,

588
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:33,143
because it's not something that I like doing, but I have to force myself to do it,

589
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:37,364
and I think that's every small business owners biggest challenge,

590
00:47:37,364 --> 00:47:45,599
is that it's not my area of expertise, I'm not a finance person and I've had to become good at things that I've never been good at before.

591
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,974
Which is challenging, but it's rewarding when it all comes together.

592
00:47:50,974 --> 00:47:54,887
(Andrew) Yeah, and if you're a growing business, cash is the life float of your business,

593
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:59,844
so like it or not, you've got to deal with cashflow proactively, you've got to

594
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:04,709
deal with debtor management proactively, otherwise you may not be in business very long.

595
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:09,990
So all businesses out there that are listening, that are in a bit of growth phase,

596
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:18,336
it's absolutely paramount that, if you don't have good record keeping system, a good debtor management process,

597
00:48:18,336 --> 00:48:24,301
that cashflow will continue to be, the bane of your life.

598
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,179
And we know, its the number one issue for our clients.

599
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:33,966
So just, the last slide there is...

600
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:39,970
(Cara) Just before we, sorry I was going to interrupt but I may as well let you give your

601
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,260
top three tips for today and then we'll go through the rest of the questions.

602
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:51,348
(Andrew) No worries. So, we've been banging on about it Em, but good accurate records,

603
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:57,086
up to date records, it's an absolute must. Choosing your customers carefully,

604
00:48:57,086 --> 00:49:02,326
engage with them proactively, upfront, and train them,

605
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:06,005
and having a good debtor system and discipline,

606
00:49:06,005 --> 00:49:11,333
and as a small business owner, no doubt you find that you've got plenty of excuses as to why

607
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:14,241
you shouldn't pick up the phone or send that email to chase the debtors,

608
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:16,775
but you've got to have that discipline to follow the process.

609
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:25,134
(Emily) Yep, I totally agree, it's not fun, but it's part of my day to day operations now.

610
00:49:25,134 --> 00:49:31,542
(Andrew) Yeah, a big part of business. So, there's some great tips and advice on the Business Victoria website,

611
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:38,826
with how to manage cashflow and deal with getting paid on time. So some great tips

612
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:40,743
and templates and whatnot.

613
00:49:40,743 --> 00:49:46,274
(Emily) And scripts as well, about what to say, because I think that's quite scary to some people,

614
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:53,250
is how do I do this, how do I have a conversation I don't want to damage my relationship - there's some

615
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,911
great scripts on there to show you how to do it.

616
00:49:56,911 --> 00:50:01,971
(Andrew) Fantastic. So head to the Business website. So Cara, some more questions?

617
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:07,578
(Cara) Yes we definitely have quite a few more questions and thanks everyone for the great

618
00:50:07,578 --> 00:50:12,118
questions you've been sending through. A few questions on the topic of interest, so

619
00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:19,201
Sonia says, she's found that what works is when she puts on her invoices that she charges 2.5%

620
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:24,576
so that's a good tip from Sonia, but we've got a question from James,

621
00:50:24,576 --> 00:50:31,543
who wants to know, what would a reasonable interest amount be, to charge clients on their outstanding balances?

622
00:50:31,543 --> 00:50:44,561
(Andrew) Oh, James it's really what you think is reasonable. So I mean, we've certainly seen it, a recent example there was 2.5%

623
00:50:44,561 --> 00:50:50,223
and we've seen it as high as 18 - 19%, so pick something you're comfortable with,

624
00:50:50,223 --> 00:50:57,726
if it's too low people might see it as cheap finance, so you're not in the business of financing your customers,

625
00:50:57,726 --> 00:51:07,199
so I think it's got to be high enough so that it's a stick and a disincentive for people to hold you out.

626
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:13,685
The flipside of that, which we haven't talked about, is early payment incentives and discounts

627
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:18,082
so that's another stick on one side being interest, and an early payment discount on the other side,

628
00:51:18,082 --> 00:51:21,198
is another good way.

629
00:51:21,198 --> 00:51:28,417
(Cara) Okay, and I guess actually leading right onto that, Kerry Anne wants to know

630
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:31,433
is it reasonable to ask for a 50% upfront payment?

631
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:38,058
(Emily) Yeah, definitely, that's what I do in my business, is I ask for 50% up front and the other

632
00:51:38,058 --> 00:51:43,256
50% when the job is completed. And I think that is more than reasonable.

633
00:51:43,256 --> 00:51:46,646
(Andrew) Yeah, I think you've just got to know your market.

634
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:56,534
Some people will be able to charge upfront, everything, some people might only accept 30%.

635
00:51:56,534 --> 00:52:01,269
And you might train your customers that where the industry has a 10% deposit, you might train them to be 50%.

636
00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:06,421
So I think it depends on your business and your market, but as Em has experienced,

637
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:10,257
50% in her game, works.

638
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:18,346
(Cara) So Martin suggests charging, what you're paying on your overdraft plus an overhead for admin.

639
00:52:18,346 --> 00:52:20,170
That's how he works it out.

640
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,826
(Andrew) Great formula Martin, great formula.

641
00:52:22,826 --> 00:52:29,274
(Cara) He'd make sure he's not out of pocket there. And Sonia has a tip as well, she says on the topic

642
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:36,364
of training customers, she's changed her statements so they read 'current and overdue' rather than

643
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:47,136
'current 30, 60 and 90,' so it's really taking out that next step or possiblity.

644
00:52:47,136 --> 00:52:52,266
(Andrew) Yep, it's also, great, great thinking there.

645
00:52:52,266 --> 00:53:03,682
(Cara) So in the debtor management process slide, we've just got a question about that from Frank,

646
00:53:03,682 --> 00:53:11,712
and he says, at which step do you say, no further supplies or services until payment of the outstanding debt is made.

647
00:53:11,712 --> 00:53:15,963
When would you put your foot down, to that extent?

648
00:53:15,963 --> 00:53:22,606
(Emily) Well that's a good question, I guess it's case by case, it depends on how much

649
00:53:22,606 --> 00:53:28,979
they've got outstanding, I have definitely put people on hold that I know I'm not doing anymore

650
00:53:28,979 --> 00:53:34,866
business with you until you pay your account. I think that when it gets to a point

651
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:39,721
when its over 30 days overdue, that that's when I would say no more.

652
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:45,869
(Andrew) Yeah and I think that that's a pretty good place to start. If they're your

653
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:54,638
largest customer and you can see a way forward and they're communicating with you openly

654
00:53:54,638 --> 00:53:59,766
and they're making some payments and you feel confident that their cashflow issues

655
00:53:59,766 --> 00:54:04,663
are short term, then you might decide to ride it out with them.

656
00:54:04,663 --> 00:54:13,915
But if you can't see a way forward, then I think the earlier you stop supply, the better.

657
00:54:13,915 --> 00:54:21,266
(Cara) Yep, okay, we've got a question from Cameron and he wants to know

658
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:25,066
what you do in the situation where an administrator or receiver is appointed,

659
00:54:25,066 --> 00:54:31,683
if you're a unsecured creditor, what are your obligations to support the company under administration?

660
00:54:31,683 --> 00:54:39,722
(Andrew) Yeah, that's a really good question Cameron, so it probably depends on how much you're owed,

661
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:47,623
so if you're owed a lot of money and it's going to cause you severe difficulties then I would be

662
00:54:47,623 --> 00:54:52,587
very proactive with the administrator in terms of doing what you can to help through.

663
00:54:52,587 --> 00:54:59,447
If you're owed a small amount, then and you can afford to write it off or whatnot,

664
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:05,595
I think you probably, history would say, those smaller creditors unsecured don't get paid

665
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:10,420
in those circumstances, it's very unlikely and you can spend a lot of time and effort

666
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:19,989
chasing a small payment when that time and effort could be spent chasing new business or better servicing your

667
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:26,858
good customers who pay on time. So I think it's a question as to what impact is it going to have

668
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:34,569
on your business and how much time is it going to take to chase down a payment,

669
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:38,805
and the trade off - where else could that time be better spent?

670
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:45,909
(Cara) Okay great, thanks Andrew. I've got a question from Johnno, he runs a computer repair business

671
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:50,904
in regional Victoria and he said he's got a couple of customers which he didn't have a

672
00:55:50,904 --> 00:55:55,497
written agreement with, can he still go through the recovery process?

673
00:55:55,497 --> 00:56:02,431
(Andrew) Yeah, I think even without a written agreement, there's no reason why

674
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:06,191
if you've supplied a product or services, and you've got evidence of that,

675
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:14,288
there's no reason why you can't chase the debt, and there's also no reason why if you haven't had a written

676
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:19,730
agreement with a customer, you can't put one in for future activities, just becuase you've been dealing with

677
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:24,176
someone for the last 5 years on a handshake, doesn't mean you can't go to them and say, look,

678
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:28,943
we've been doing this on a handshake, let's formalise this a bit because it will be good for you,

679
00:56:28,943 --> 00:56:31,331
and it will be good for us.

680
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:37,032
(Emily) I think that a letter of demand, normally gets people moving, or else not

681
00:56:37,032 --> 00:56:43,608
from a solicitor, they go, oh okay this is getting serious now, so it's a formal message

682
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:49,453
that looks a little bit scarier than just the normal email or phone call.

683
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:54,196
So I would advise that, that would be step one.

684
00:56:54,196 --> 00:56:57,960
And then if that doesn't work, then actually going and finding a solicitor who's going

685
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:05,075
to send them a letter, because there's nothing like a solicitors letterhead to scare people.

686
00:57:05,075 --> 00:57:12,840
(Cara) Okay. Brian wants to know has sending those letters of demand lost you any customers?

687
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,193
(Emily) No, never.

688
00:57:16,193 --> 00:57:25,445
(Cara) That's good to hear, the process does work. A few final tips from our listeners.

689
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:32,906
We've got Marie-Claire, she only asks for 50% deposits from big companies that might be able to get around the

690
00:57:32,906 --> 00:57:38,190
14 day trading terms, so that's one suggestion. And another one from Andra, who says

691
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:47,627
she charges a $25 statement fee for all accounts over 30 days. And that scares

692
00:57:47,627 --> 00:57:53,033
a lot of people into paying. So they're both good tips there.

693
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:57,998
But we should finish things up there, because we are coming up to the end of our hour,

694
00:57:57,998 --> 00:58:04,109
so I know that all of you listening have got businesses to run and things to do,

695
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:10,119
and so do our presenters, so I would really like to thank our two presenters,

696
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:15,785
who have really been so generous with their time and expertise today, Andrew and Emily,

697
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:22,529
we've really appreciated that, and special thanks to our partner for today's webinar Business Victoria.

698
00:58:22,529 --> 00:58:28,138
As you've heard during the seminar, their website is really a wealth of information

699
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:33,905
for all of this sort of information, so it's a really good resource to go to,

700
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:40,066
www.business.vic.gov.au and it's got templates on there and tips.
