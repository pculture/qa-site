[Gidon:] Many people are asking us,

4
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:14,846
"What's these traffic marks we have in our hallway?"

5
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:19,622
That's actually something that happens in wool-plush carpets

6
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:22,413
where the carpet is going in different directions.

7
00:00:23,013 --> 00:00:26,263
That's why you have white areas, and black areas.

8
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:27,611
I'll show you...

00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:31,559
Here you can see how the paper goes one way.

10
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:37,587
And here you can see where the paper goes a different way.

11
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,334
And that's why we have two different colors in the one area.
