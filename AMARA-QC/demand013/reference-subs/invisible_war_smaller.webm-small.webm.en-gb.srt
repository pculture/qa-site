<i>And I'm like, "I cant, I'm in bed,"and he would then threaten me.</i>

152
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:13,690
<i>I'd walk in from training and he'd be sleeping in my bed.</i>

153
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:17,231
When we went to 
one of the higher‐ups

154
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:21,798
in the chain of command,
they were all like his drinking buddy

155
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:24,369
and they told me just because
I didn't like somebody,

156
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,800
they weren't going to switch me
away from this guy.

157
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:32,975
It was in the evening, around taps,
and he had unlocked the door

158
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:35,815
and he had come in,
and he had an erection

159
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:37,815
and he tried to get me to touch him.

160
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:40,714
I took my right hand and
I pushed him in the chest

161
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:44,785
and started to yell for the other guys
to kinda hear me, "Hey, hey, hey."

162
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:50,280
He hit me across
the left side of my face.

163
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:56,065
I remember holding the closet thinking, 
"What just happened?"

164
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,905
And my face hurt so bad.

165
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:05,839
<i>And when we wentto the command about it,</i>

166
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,208
<i>me and this petty officer who saw my face,</i>

167
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,947
<i>they just let it wait 'cause they didn't want any problems going on.</i>

168
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:19,687
<i>A couple of weeks later, I needed the key to do my cleanup</i>

169
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,843
so I knocked on his door
and he said,

170
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,098
"Okay, yeah. come on in here. 
It's in here."

171
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:25,191
And I said, "No, no, no,
I'm gonna wait out here."

172
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:28,528
And he said screamed at me 
and he made me come in,

173
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,130
and he grabbed my arm

174
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,877
[sobbing]

175
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:59,127
and he raped me at his berthing area.

176
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:04,671
- Everything came to a complete change

177
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,031
the day that I was raped.

178
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,225
- I got there in February
and by April

179
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,472
I was drugged and raped
for the first time.

180
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,876
- I had a cold or pneumonia-like symptoms

181
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:21,721
and so they sent me to get checked out. 
And, while I was waiting to be examined,

182
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,551
he came in and he helped himself.

183
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:26,620
- He said he was going to the bathroom

184
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,457
and he came into my room
and that's when he raped me.

185
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,693
- The entire time I was screaming

186
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:37,467
and yelling for help and for him to stop, 
nobody came to the door,

187
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:41,736
nobody came to help me,
came to my rescue or anything.

188
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,177
- They made it very, very clear 
that if I said anything,

189
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:51,678
they were going to kill me, you know, 
and then of course,

190
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,243
I didn't have anyone to go talk to
because the people that

191
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:57,387
were perpetrating me were the police.

192
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:04,234
- It was my first time ever, 
and I've had a tough time

193
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:07,227
convincing myself that I'm still a virgin.

194
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:13,007
- If this is happening to me, I can only 
imagine surely I'm not the only one,

195
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:17,872
in which I find out later, going through 
the claims process, that I wasn't.

196
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:26,717
$$ Over 20% of female veterans have been 
sexually assaulted while serving.

197
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:34,187
- It's just after three am, I see 
a shadow of a human head over my body.

198
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:38,625
- Next thing you know, 
like I wake up and like he's on top of me.

199
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:42,596
- He pushed my legs apart 
and put himself on top of me

200
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,197
and started pulling at my shirt.

201
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:47,336
- And I wake up, and he's on top of me.

202
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,806
He's already penetrated me.

203
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:56,516
- I was drugged. I remember 
the sounds, the smell.

204
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,680
- He put his locked and loaded
45 at the base of my skull,

205
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:05,324
and gauged the bolt so that I knew 
that it was around chambered.

206
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,360
- All I could do was continue 
to concentrate on breathing.

207
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,124
- He slammed my head 
against the concrete wall

208
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,800
and very forcefully had sex with me.

209
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,732
- I just went to my tent, 
pulled the sleeping bag over my head

210
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,502
and cried myself to sleep.

211
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:23,141
- So, within that two-week period,

212
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:26,017
he raped me five times.

213
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:32,018
- When we got tested, 
I had trich and gonorrhea

214
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,018
and I was pregnant.

215
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:40,225
- And he did it. He raped me.

216
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:48,028
- In 1991, in Congressional testimony,

217
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:51,534
it was estimated that 200,000 women
had been sexually assaulted so far

218
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:54,301
in the US Military. 
If you take into account that women

219
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:57,973
don't report because of
the extreme retaliation and that was,

220
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,145
<i>you know, more than a decade ago.</i>

221
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:03,243
<i>I would say you could easilydouble that number</i>

222
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,184
<i>and it's probably somewhere near abouthalf a million women have now been</i>

223
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:08,112
<i>sexually assaulted in the US military.</i>

224
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:10,758
- Well, according to the 
Department of Defense,

225
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:17,758
3230 women and men reported assault
in the last fiscal year, fiscal year 2009

226
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:24,498
But they also admit, D.O.D itself, 
that 80% of sexual assault survivors

227
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:31,312
do not report. So if you do the math, 
16,150 service members

228
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:34,347
<i>were assaulted,which is an extraordinary number.</i>

There's some of it here, too.

This all was prescribed 
in the last three to four months.

<i>I was having the most horriblepain in my face,</i>

239

00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,521
<i>or something was wrong. The doctor came in after the X‐ rays</i>

<i>and asked me if I had been in a car accident.</i>

242
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,627
When he hit me in my face,
he dislocated my jaw

243
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:31,231
and it sent both of my disks 
forward in my face so I don't have

any disks where they should be in my face.

245
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:38,105
They told me I'd probably need a
partial bone replacement.

246
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:41,375
From where my bone had been laying 
on my nerves for so long,

00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,311
it's starting to actually disintegrate.

I told her that she would be. 
It was in February, we got a call.

299
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:07,981
$$ On February 1st 2008,
Hannah was locked in a hotel room

300
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,318
and raped by a fellow recruit. $$

301
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,187
- Once he was done,

302
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:16,924
he rubbed his hand 
all over my entire body

303
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:21,728
and told me, he said,
"I own all of this."

304
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:26,033
<i>And I was just absolutely scared,didn't know what to do.</i>

305
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,235
<i>I called my dad.</i>

306
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:29,936
- One of the first things she said is,

307
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,621
"Dad, I'm no longer a virgin."

308
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:43,635
And I said, "What happened?" 
And she said, "I was raped."

309
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:49,756
And I said,
"Hannah, you're a virgin because

310
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:54,605
he took something from you
that you didn't give."

311
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:56,374
[sobbing]

312
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,235
I said, "So, don't ever think you're not."

313
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,874
- My main nerve in my spine 
was pinched in three places

314
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,010
and my hips were rotated.

315
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,960
I could barely walk. I had collapsed due
to muscle spasms in my back

316
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,446
because my back
was injured during the rape.

317
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,925
<i>- [Admiral Anthony Kurta] My title isDirector of Military Plans</i>

318
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:27,848
<i>and Personnel policy for the Navy.</i>

319
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,831
We have specifically trained
judge advocates.

320
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:34,935
Our Navy lawyers, in our naval criminal
investigative service,

321
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:38,472
those investigators are all specifically
trained in sexual assault.

322
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:41,441
Any report of a sexual assault 
is fully investigated

323
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,210
in the United States Navy.

324
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,544
- They didn't take care of it.

325
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,814
For a year and a half, 
they were tracking down witnesses.

326
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:51,218
<i>They had all these students there and they could have locked them down</i>

327
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:54,021
and said, "Hey you're on legal hold 
until I get a statement."

328
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:58,258
And they didn't. Hannah went through 
three investigators.

329
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,795
It was like, "Okay I'm given this case."
That's what it sort of felt like.

330
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:03,997
"Oh, alright I'm given this case.
I got to take care of it."

331
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,034
"Oh well, this is a navy one.

332
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:07,034
I really don't have
the time to deal with it."

333
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:08,869
- Females would come up 
to their commanders

334
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:13,106
or their NCOs and say that they were
either sexually assaulted or abused

335
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,475
and I don't think it was taken seriously.

336
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,745
I think a lot of times
a cursory investigation was done

337
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:21,616
and they were basically told
to just suck it up.

338
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:23,216
- I remember bringing in 
a young service member

339
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:26,853
who had been brutally raped, 
and bringing her in to see her command,

340
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:30,624
and trying to make sure that this 
young girl was taken care of properly.

341
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:37,698
And this idiot, chewed her out for crying,
told her to stop crying over spilt milk.

342
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,966
- A lot of times, 
the credibility of the witness

343
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,536
was called into account.
Had the potential victim,

344
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,840
had she made claims
like this in the past?

345
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,574
There was a lot of witch hunting going on.

346
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:51,278
- I was ordered to advise a victim 
of her rights

347
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:53,880
for false statement when I knew 
that she wasn't lying.

348
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,583
I was asked to bring her in 
and advise her of her rights,

349
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,920
like a criminal and interrogate her
for false statement,

350
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,056
"until I got the truth out of her."

351
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:06,693
<i>If a woman makes a rape complaint,there are always people asking</i>

352
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:09,429
what she was doing there, 
what she was wearing,

353
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,832
whether she had a boyfriend or not.

354
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,668
- If rape cases came in, 
they were never given to women.

355
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,303
The men always took care of those.

356
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:17,237
<i>- Why is that?</i>

357
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:19,673
- Because we were too sympathetic.

358
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,974
<i>- Is that what they said to you?</i>

359
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,109
- Uh-hmm.

360
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:26,747
"We couldn't see what was really going on
because we always took the woman's side."

361
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,849
- I was told I should have been 
a social worker.

362
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,785
I had no business being 
in the police field.

363
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:37,491
There was a lot of resistance there
toward the idea that victims should be

364
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:41,637
afforded some kind of sensitivity.
It was almost a laughing matter.

365
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:44,466
- We have given specific training 
and continual training

366
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:48,168
to our NCIS, 
Navy Criminal Investigative Service,

367
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:54,991
those investigators on how best to
respond and to investigate those crimes.

368
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,750
- They told me they lost my rape kit

369
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:14,761
and my nurse examiners report and the
pictures from the bruising on my arm.

370
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,396
<i>- [Amy] They lost these things? </i>

371
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,399
That's what they told me.
They told me that they had lost them.

372
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:23,403
And me being me,
I decided to do a little digging

373
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:29,342
of my own and I spoke with 
NCIS headquartersin Washington DC,

374
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:34,348
and they have all the evidence.

375
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,949
<i>- [Amy] So what does this mean? </i>

376
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:37,584
- Because the case is already closed,

377
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,233
there's nothing they can do.

378
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,692
<i>- [Susan Burke] What we hearagain and again</i>

379
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,795
from soldiers who have been raped,

380
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:53,867
is that as bad as it was being raped, 
what was as bad, if not worse,

381
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:57,700
was to receive professional retaliation

382
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,333
in their chosen career, 
merely because they were raped.

383
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,933
- When you report something,

384
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:07,267
you better be prepared 
for the repercussions.

385
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:10,533
- If a man gets accused of rape, 
it's a set‐up.

386
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,300
The woman is lying.

387
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,200
- I could choose to report it, 
but if they found out

388
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,267
what I was saying wasn't to be truthful, 
then I would be reduced in rank.

389
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:23,133
- You could lose your rate, 
you could lose rank,

390
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:26,100
you could lose your school, 
if you file a false report.

391
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,800
So do you want to file a report? 
[Laughs]

392
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,300
- Even with the rape kit and everything,

393
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,533
and my friend catching him raping me,
they still don't believe me.

394
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:40,900
- I reported it two different times 
to my squad leader

395
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,000
and he told me that there was nothing 
he could do about it

396
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,900
'cause I didn't have any proof.

397
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:50,200
- They actually did charge me 
with adultery.

398
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,400
I wasn't married. He was.

399
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,867
- They took me before 
my lieutenant commander.

400
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:59,167
He says, "You think this is funny?"
I said, "What do you mean?"

401
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,067
He's like, "Is this all a joke to you?"

402
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,333
I said, "What do you mean?"

403
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:06,267
And he goes, "You're the third girl
to report rape this week."

404
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:10,440
"Are you guys like, all in cahoots,
you think this is a game?"

405

In doctor's appointments,

444

I come to every one just in case
she gets worked up

445
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:22,129
and she's uneasy around men already.
So, I have my phone up on me.

446
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:27,056
She already has, I tell her to have

00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:53,809
I don't know, there's something else.

595
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:57,759
<i>- [Michael] I had never told anybody in over thirty years.</i>

596
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:01,027
I decided to tell my wife.

597
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:04,321
It was the scariest moment of my life. 
I was going to tell my wife,

598
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:07,775
she was going to leave me, 
and I would be lost without her.

599
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:11,969
I mean, honest to God,
I couldn't get up every morning

600
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:18,318
without my wife, you know.
And I told her.

601
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:22,759
- I felt horrified, and I felt sad 
and I felt angry, and you know,

602
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:28,145
along the course of the evening, 
feelings just started to surface

603
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:32,252
that were probably just simmering
for a very, very long time.

604
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:37,250
- And she put her arms around me
and we both sat there and sobbed

605
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:43,631
It was like, this great weight
had been lifted off of me.

606
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:47,416
<i>- [Brigadier Gen. Loree Sutton] I think it's important to recognize</i>

607
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:51,628
<i>that military sexual trauma is not limited to women,</i>

608
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:54,510
and in fact, when it comes 
to the absolute numbers,

609
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:59,064
because of the proportion of men,
in much larger numbers than women,

610
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:02,766
actually the numbers are even greater.

611
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,228
<i>- [Russell Strand] I think one of the last bits of research,</i>

612
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:08,665
showed that about 1% of males 
had been victims of sexual assault

613
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:10,376
within the past year in the military.

614
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:12,175
That equals to about 20,000.

615
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:14,463
- You would get labeled
as a 'buddy‐fucker'

616
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:18,932
and that's not a nice term
to be related to.

617
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:21,955
So, it's just one of those things 
that you just don't talk about

618
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:26,082
or you don't bring to anybody's attention.
You just kind of keep it to yourself.

619
00:38:26,082 --> 00:38:30,467
- It's really, really hard to forget.

620
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:35,386
You know up until now, I still --
they live in my head, you know.

621
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:39,722
I can hear them laugh,
I can see their faces,

622
00:38:39,722 --> 00:38:42,634
I can see what they're doing to me.

623
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:50,552
- I felt scared and I was scared 
to tell my friends,

624
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:54,948
the people that really knew me 
the truth about what happened.

625
00:38:54,948 --> 00:38:57,543
- The shame, as bad as it is 
for women

626
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:01,706
is even worse for men, because
it's all tied in with homophobia.

627
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,815
- The people who are 
doing the raping are not gay.

628
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:07,941
That's not the problem. They're worried 
about gays in the military.

629
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:09,693
The gays are not the rapists.

630
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:12,505
They are heterosexual men
for the most part.

631
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:14,358
- This is not an issue 
of sexual orientation,

632
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:16,696
this is simply an issue of power
and violence.

633
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:19,523
Male sexual predators
for the large part, have targeted

634
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,829
whoever is there to prey upon,
whether that's men or women.

635
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,777
- Whenever I'd see that, you know,

636
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:31,398
there is evidence that another
woman has been sexually assaulted,

637
00:39:31,398 --> 00:39:33,390
the question I keep asking myself is,

It was just a few steps into the hallway 
before they closed ranks all around me.

652
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:27,544
And then it happened very quickly,

"You know, what happened here?"

00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:47,116
sleeping with so and so. 
Apparently I slept with all these men,

741
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:50,393
and I mean, I didn't.

742

<i>- [Ariana] They got progressively worse and worse.</i>

743

They determined that I welcomed the
sexual harassment by

<i>wearing my regulation length uniform skirt and running in running shorts.</i>

745
00:46:04,002 --> 00:46:07,565
There were several junior female
marines that came up to me crying,

they felt too humiliated to come to work.

<i>- [Elle Helmer] One of the duties atMarine Barracks Washington,</i>

750
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,839

751
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,159
The evening parades are what

you would see on the news. 
The sound drill platoon, President,

everybody goes to those type of things.

754

<i>and drink at Center Houseat Marine Barracks, Washington.</i>

<i>that start at three and end at two AM.</i>

758
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,895
- It was a partying and drinking culture.

759
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,434
The atmosphere revolved around 
going out and partying and drinking.

760
00:46:58,434 --> 00:47:02,710
- I was ordered to drink. I was ordered 
to attend the drinking events.

761
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,889
- My boss even said that they
were mandatory to me.

She's like, "We do our best work 
at these events."

767
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:26,598

This is the norm.

768
00:47:26,598 --> 00:47:30,266
<i>- [Elle Helmer] At one bar, I had water, and I was ordered a shot anyway,</i>

769
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:33,878
and told I needed to take two shots,
to make up for that.

$$ March 16, 2006.

<i>I left the bar to get a cab.</i>

772
00:47:38,882 --> 00:47:41,016
My company commander
followed me and said,

773
00:47:41,016 --> 00:47:43,317
"I need to talk to you 
about some things."

774
00:47:45,715 --> 00:47:48,112
So, we walked up the stairs 
in to his office.

775
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:49,734
<i>There was a little bit of a struggle.</i>

<i>He tried to kind of make an advanceand tried to kiss me.</i>

777
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:56,991
I tried to leave and he slammed 
the door on my arms.

778
00:47:56,991 --> 00:48:00,088
<i>I fell on the ground and hit my face on his desk.</i>

779
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:03,657
And the next thing I realized was
I had woken up wearing his shorts

780
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:07,261
with all of my clothes off 
and in tremendous pain.

781
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:10,518
I knew enough about me
that something wasn't right

782
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:12,692
and I had felt entirely violated.

783
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:16,875
$$ The day after the incident, 
NCIS opened an investigation.

784
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:22,398
$$ It was closed three days later 
with no action taken.

785
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:25,719
$$ Two days later, the base commander
initiated his own investigation.

786
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:29,169
The colonel at one point said,
"You know, Lieutenant Helmer,

787
00:48:29,169 --> 00:48:31,868
boys girls and alcohol just don't mix.

788
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,492
We'll never really know 
what happened inside that office.

789
00:48:34,492 --> 00:48:37,721
Only you and the major know
and he's not talking.

790
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:41,597
So, at this point, the investigation 
is closed for a lack of evidence

791
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:45,089
and we've reopened a new investigation
against you

792
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:49,515
for conduct unbecoming of an officer
and public intoxication."

793
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:56,142
- I remember, we're going to the bar,

794
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,136
and there was an officer that said
he's buying shots for us.

795
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:03,297
After I've had a couple of drinks,
that's all I remember.

796
00:49:03,297 --> 00:49:08,418
$$ The same officer stalked and raped her 
on three separate occasions.

797
00:49:08,418 --> 00:49:12,034
This officer bragged 
to his fellow officer friends

798
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:18,173
that he had 'bagged' me.
I got called up to a major's office

799
00:49:18,173 --> 00:49:22,276
and he charged me 
with fraternization and adultery.

800
00:49:22,276 --> 00:49:25,519
He was married, I wasn't,
and I was charged with adultery.

801
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:32,248
<i>- [Ariana] I told the battalion XO about the humiliation and the comments,</i>

what a marine officer should do

803
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:39,820
and that's to ignore it and move on."

804
00:49:41,698 --> 00:49:46,978
- I used to lie awake in bed, you know, 
wondering what I could do

805
00:49:46,978 --> 00:49:49,072
to help her get out.

806
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:54,705
$$ After a weekly drinking event 
in August 2010, Ariana was raped

by a senior officer 3and his friend. $$

808
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,920
- He said that if I told anybody, that 
he was going to have his friend Marve

809
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,996
from Indiana kill me 
and throw me in a ditch,

810
00:50:03,996 --> 00:50:06,851
because that's how they
take care of things in Indiana.

811
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:12,325
<i>- [Ben Klay] She went to war and gave nine years of her life,</i>

812

and come back and say,

813
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:24,385
"Yes they called you a whore, 
yes they called you a slut,

814
00:50:24,385 --> 00:50:27,281
yes they called you a walking mattress,
it's documented

815
00:50:27,281 --> 00:50:31,602
over and over and over again,
but you deserved it

816
00:50:31,602 --> 00:50:36,080
and when you complained about it,
you were welcoming it."

817
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,905
- The actions of my seniors,
both in the assault and in the ensuing

818
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:45,086

you rummage through the house
searching for the suicide note,

821
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,816
to call the police with one hand

822
00:51:04,816 --> 00:51:09,532
while you're restraining her 
from killing herself with the other.

823
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:17,781
<i>- [Ariana] I think the thing that makes methe most angry </i>

824
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:20,610
<i>is not even the rape in itself.</i>

825
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:25,135
it's the commanders that were complicit 
in covering up everything that happened.

826
00:51:25,135 --> 00:51:28,074
$$ The filmmakers contacted
five female marines

827

828

$$at Marine Barracks Washington.

829
00:51:35,023 --> 00:51:44,148
$$ Four of the women were investigated 
or punished after they reported.

830
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:52,232
$$No officer was punished for any assault.

831
00:51:52,232 --> 00:51:56,139
- This is an organization that
gives commanders

832
00:51:56,139 --> 00:51:57,948
an unbelievable amount of power.

833
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:03,138
And I felt it, as a lieutenant in Iraq,
it's scary. You appoint the prosecution,

834
00:52:03,138 --> 00:52:05,455
you appoint the defense, 
you appoint the investigator,

835
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:09,570
you're in charge of the police force, 
you're in charge of the community.

836
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:13,560
You own everything. You are judge,
you are jury, you are executioner.

837
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,665
- Most Americans assume that
there is access to a system of justice,

838
00:52:17,665 --> 00:52:21,421
so that, for example if you're a civilian
and you're raped, you can call the police

839
00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:23,272
and then you have prosecutors,

840
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:26,330
either federal prosecutors, state 
prosecutors, local prosecutors,

841
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:31,093
that bring the perpetrator to justice.
The problem with the military is that

842
00:52:31,093 --> 00:52:34,634
instead, they have to go 
to their chain of command.

843
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:37,879
- Now in our system of military justice,

844
00:52:37,879 --> 00:52:43,906
it is the commander who's responsible
to the chain of command

845
00:52:43,906 --> 00:52:47,521
for how that investigation proceeds.

846
00:52:47,521 --> 00:52:51,031
- I know that there's been numerous times 
over my career that I regretted

847
00:52:51,031 --> 00:52:56,094
that an individual commander 
had the total say so over a case.

848
00:52:56,094 --> 00:53:00,608
Most of them don't have the training
or the education to determine

849
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:04,484
what's appropriate and in serious 
felony criminal investigations.

850
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:07,342
- The problem in the military 
is the convening authority

851
00:53:07,342 --> 00:53:10,539
who is not legally trained, 
makes the final decision.

852
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:13,833
[aircraft taking off]

853
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:16,008
<i>- [Jessica Hinves] They had achange of command at my old squadron</i>

854
00:53:16,008 --> 00:53:18,556
where the guy that raped me 
was still stationed.

855
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:22,140
He had only been in command 
for four days,

856
00:53:22,509 --> 00:53:26,367
and he made a decision 
over legal to stop the case.

857
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:29,575
- What I saw was commanders, 
and these are field grade officers,

858
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:34,042
lieutenant colonels, colonels who 
have been in 20, 25 years,

859
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:41,199
they're career officers, 
and they sweep cases under the rug.

860
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:46,434
- The last thing a company commander 
in the army wants to do

861
00:53:46,434 --> 00:53:50,090
is make the phone call to his 
or her battalion commander to say,

862
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:54,470
"I have had an allegation of a rape 
in my unit."

863
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:58,435
This is viewed in many cases 
as a failure to command

864
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:02,437
that will adversely then 
affect their career.

865
00:54:02,437 --> 00:54:05,214
- Sometimes you would see a guy
get four or five years

866
00:54:05,214 --> 00:54:07,537
for selling a minor amount of drugs.

867
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:11,277
And then you would see a guy
get two weeks extra duty for rape.

868
00:54:11,277 --> 00:54:16,901
- The military hides behind this notion 
that it is really, really hard,

869
00:54:16,901 --> 00:54:19,158
almost impossible to prosecute rape.

870
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:24,057
<i>But when you look at prosecution ratesin the 2010 Department of Defense reports,</i>

871
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:31,372
<i>you begin with 2410 unrestricted reportsand 748 restricted.</i>

872
00:54:31,372 --> 00:54:35,885
<i>What that means is they've alreadyfunneled 748 sexual assault victims</i>

873
00:54:35,885 --> 00:54:40,482
<i>into a system that has absolutely no adjudication whatsoever.</i>

874
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:43,642
<i>Then you take the 2410 that have been reported,</i>

875
00:54:43,642 --> 00:54:47,910
<i>of those they have identified3223 perpetrators.</i>

876
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,393
<i>Now what happens once you send a perpetrator over to command?</i>

877
00:54:51,393 --> 00:54:54,329
<i>Well, the command has just completely unfettered discretion</i>

878
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:56,360
<i>to do whatever it is they want.</i>

879
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,355
<i>And what is it that they do do?</i>

880
00:54:58,355 --> 00:55:02,576
<i>First off, they drop 910 of them,they just don't do anything.</i>

881
00:55:02,576 --> 00:55:06,306
<i>Then of the 1025 that they actually take some action,</i>

882
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:07,792
<i>do they court martial them?</i>

883
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:13,305
<i>No. Only half of them, 529,actually got court martialed.</i>

884
00:55:13,305 --> 00:55:17,596
<i>The rest 256 were subjected toArticle 15 punishments,</i>

"Wait until she's sober."

And it's remarkable that that's allowed
to pass in today's military.

913

- You cannot prevent sexual assault 
with pretty posters.

Posters do not prevent sexual predators 
from preying upon women

We're talking about barging into rooms 
in the middle of the night.

922
00:57:23,428 --> 00:57:26,125
No poster can prevent a criminal
from barging into a room.

These are violent people.

- One of the things that we do 
in our prevention strategy

925
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:35,621
is to focus on bystander intervention. 
And in that strategy and in that training

926
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:38,938
we ask for each soldier or sailor, 
airman and marine,

927
00:57:38,938 --> 00:57:41,724
to be aware of what sexual assault is 
and how to prevent it.

that had been raped

1032
01:03:18,897 --> 01:03:21,150
or sexually assaulted had told me
that she looked at these guys

1033
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:24,508
as her brother, or the suspect 
as her brother.

1034
01:03:24,508 --> 01:03:30,039
- It's akin to what happens 
in a family with incest.

1035
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:35,348
Because, you know, in the military, 
when we're functioning at our best

1036
01:03:35,348 --> 01:03:39,710
in a cohesive unit with brothers 
and sisters, you know,

1037
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:43,351
the band of brothers and sisters, 
I mean we are family.

1038
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:48,569
When that bond of trust is violated,

1039
01:03:53,446 --> 01:04:00,436
the wound penetrates to the very most 
inner part of one's soul, one's psyche.

1040
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:07,639
<i>- [Kori Cioca] I have this folderthat I keep.</i>

1041
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,039
I have all my bootcamp letters in it,

1042
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:14,491
<i>from my mom and my sisterand people and...</i>

1043
01:04:14,491 --> 01:04:17,610
I was just going through some 
of the stuff and I'm like, "What's this?"

1044
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:25,819
When I opened it up, I'm like, 
"Oh my god, my suicide letter."

1045
01:04:25,819 --> 01:04:30,539
<i>Mom, I'm sorry for the grief that you must feel.</i>

1046
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:32,554
<i>Just because I'm gone physically</i>

1047
01:04:32,554 --> 01:04:35,193
doesn't mean 
I won't be there spiritually.

1048
01:04:35,193 --> 01:04:38,424
<i>I truly feel that God willtake me without question,</i>

1049
01:04:38,424 --> 01:04:42,182
<i>even though I took my own life.</i>

1050
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:44,264
I've had the most broken thoughts,

1051
01:04:44,264 --> 01:04:46,294
<i>dreams, and physical pain to remind me</i>

1052
01:04:46,294 --> 01:04:50,485
<i>of the horrific acts upon methat happened while on duty.</i>

1053
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:53,016
<i>A mother, brother, sister and husband should never live</i>

1054
01:04:53,016 --> 01:04:56,116
<i>with knowing the horrible acts upon me.</i>

1055
01:04:56,116 --> 01:05:01,227
<i>Find peace in knowing that the bodyleft behind doesn't consume my soul.</i>

1056
01:05:01,227 --> 01:05:04,327
<i>I am free now, and I'm not afraid.</i>

1057
01:05:04,327 --> 01:05:07,655
<i>Ready to soar, Kori Danielle.</i>

1058
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:12,487
<i>- [Trina McDonald] I took a whole bottle of pills.</i>

1059
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:17,153
And woke up strangely enough, 
I'm not sure why. [chuckles]

1060
01:05:17,153 --> 01:05:21,151
At that point in my life
I just wanted it to be over.

1061
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:28,811
I think I was 20, 21 and then 
within the next year, I tried again.

1062
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:30,141
- I went out into the garage,

1063
01:05:30,141 --> 01:05:34,357
which was separate from the house,
and I turned the car on.

1064
01:05:34,357 --> 01:05:37,061
I was going to sit in the car
and asphyxiate myself.

1065
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:39,080
And we have this little poodle, 
Blondie.

1066
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,250
She went out in the little doggy door

1067
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,703
and she's scratching 
and howling at the door.

1068
01:05:41,703 --> 01:05:45,464
I said, "Shut up, Goddammit!
You're going to wake my wife up."

1069
01:05:45,464 --> 01:05:48,386
So I got out, shut the car off,
and I thought for a minute,

1070
01:05:48,386 --> 01:05:50,298
I'll just take her in the garage with me.

1071
01:05:50,298 --> 01:05:53,597
Then, I said, "Why would you kill a dog?
That's stupid."

1072
01:05:53,597 --> 01:05:57,029
And then it dawned on me,
"Why would you kill yourself?"

1073
01:05:57,029 --> 01:06:02,690
- I thought of it, so many times,
and in so many ways.

1074
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:05,953
I thought about at one point in time,

1075
01:06:05,953 --> 01:06:08,016
hanging myself from the flagpole,

1076
01:06:08,016 --> 01:06:16,038
with a sign on me saying exactly
what happened, to make him feel bad.

1077
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:19,574
- I was gonna overdose 
on pain medication

1078
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:23,930
and sleeping medication,
and just hope that I would fall asleep

1079
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:27,753
and my body would just shut down,
or do something.

1080
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:31,597
When I went to the doctor, 
I had been feeling sick,

1081
01:06:31,597 --> 01:06:36,268
and dizzy and nauseated,
and they took my urine

1082
01:06:36,268 --> 01:06:39,062
and they told me that I was pregnant.

1083
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:42,188
And it was like, there's a life in there,
you know.

1084
01:06:42,188 --> 01:06:44,105
And maybe her life 
will be better than mine,

1085
01:06:44,105 --> 01:06:50,230
and I've got to make sure of that. 
So, she's very special.

1086
01:06:53,415 --> 01:06:57,575
<i>- [Brigadier Wilma Vaught] Sometimes it takes a different kind of action</i>

1087
01:06:57,575 --> 01:07:05,299
to cause change to come, 
and sometimes that's a lawsuit.

1088
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:10,590
<i>-[Susan Burke] I grew up on military basesMy dad was career army.</i>

1089
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,623
<i>When I was a child, when we answered the phone,</i>

1090
01:07:12,623 --> 01:07:14,922
<i>we used to have to say,"Colonel Burke's quarters,"</i>

1091
01:07:14,922 --> 01:07:16,107
[chuckles]

1092
01:07:16,107 --> 01:07:17,577
and because of that,

1093
01:07:17,577 --> 01:07:23,000
I have an understanding of the level 
of control that the military exercises

1094
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,388
that perhaps most 
in the civilian life don't have.

1095
01:07:27,388 --> 01:07:29,832
<i>The Feres Doctrineis a judicial doctrine</i>

1096
01:07:29,832 --> 01:07:32,109
<i>that was developed bythe Supreme Court that says,</i>

1097
01:07:32,109 --> 01:07:37,692
<i>if you're in the military, you cannot suefor something that happens to you</i>

1098
01:07:37,692 --> 01:07:39,821
<i>that's incident to your military service.</i>

1099
01:07:39,821 --> 01:07:42,359
<i>If your military doctor amputatethe wrong limb,</i>

1100
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:47,059
you are out of luck, you cannot sue
for that harm that's been done to you.

1101
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:53,580
<i>So, we filed a law suit in federal courton behalf of 16 men and women,</i>

1102
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,800
seeking to bring
former Secretary Rumsfeld

1103
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,230
and Secretary Gates to justice.

1104
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:07,914
- I heard about the lawsuit 
and decided to become a part of it

1105
01:08:07,914 --> 01:08:09,600
because I never wanted 
another woman

1106
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,886
to go through what I went through.

1107
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:17,686
$$ <i>- How have you been feeling emotionally about doing this?</i>

1108
01:08:17,686 --> 01:08:21,969
- Oh, I've been so sick, like just sick
to my stomach.

1109
01:08:21,969 --> 01:08:25,366
And I think right now, I'm just 
kind of like, just get there.

1110
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:27,880
I'm like numbing myself just 
to get there.

1111
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:33,490
And then I know when I get there, 
it should -- I don't know.

1112
01:08:45,764 --> 01:08:49,150
[Susan Burke] The law suit alleges 
that they have overseen

1113
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:54,547
a system that has deprived the rape 
survivors of their constitutional rights,

1114
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,981
specifically we alleged
that they deprived them

1115
01:08:56,981 --> 01:09:00,595
of their substantive due process, 
procedural due process,

1116
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:03,302
equal protection
and <i>First Amendment</i> rights.

1117
01:09:18,873 --> 01:09:21,852
<i>[Kori] It made me sick to see everybody's stories.</i>

1118
01:09:21,852 --> 01:09:25,685
How they kind of closely tie together.
Everybody's story somehow has a --

1119
01:09:25,685 --> 01:09:28,877
It's consistent, like what
the military does to people like us.

1120
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:33,029
- All the things that they've put in place
are all pretty much intended

1121
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:37,572
to help women deal
with being raped better,

1122
01:09:37,572 --> 01:09:39,746
that's what they're about.

1123
01:09:42,855 --> 01:09:46,184
- I joined the military halfway through
my senior year of high school,

1124
01:09:46,184 --> 01:09:49,708
wanting to serve my country
and do new things

1125
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:52,877
and challenge myself in a different way.

1126
01:09:54,131 --> 01:09:55,942
<i>I was in the army about sevenor eight years</i>

1127
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:59,163
<i>before anything ever happened to me.</i>

1128
01:09:59,163 --> 01:10:04,620
I was raped by another CID agent
who was senior to me.

1129
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:11,109
I was contacted by an agent
with Fort Riley CID,

1130
01:10:11,109 --> 01:10:15,872
who said they were investigating 
the suspect as a serial rapist

1131
01:10:15,872 --> 01:10:19,612
who had raped several military 
law enforcement women.

1132
01:10:19,612 --> 01:10:23,989
I thought, there was no way that, 
you know, he wouldn't be convicted.

1133
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:25,601
If I have a difficult time with anything,

1134
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:28,439
it's about the fact that I had 
an almost ten-year career

1135
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:32,348
which I was very invested in, and 
I gave it all up to report a sex offender

1136
01:10:32,348 --> 01:10:36,328
who was not even put to justice
or put on the registry,

1137
01:10:36,328 --> 01:10:39,901
and he's probably doing 
the same thing right now.

1138
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:41,726
- I had one female lieutenant
pull me aside

1139
01:10:41,726 --> 01:10:44,822
and tell me that, you know, 
she had heard about my case

1140
01:10:44,822 --> 01:10:48,012
and she thought she could talk to me 
as one female marine to another,

1141
01:10:48,012 --> 01:10:48,982
and she told me,

1142
01:10:48,982 --> 01:10:52,824
"Well, what he did, was capitalize on an
opportunity that you presented him."

1143
01:10:52,824 --> 01:10:56,093
"That's not the same thing as rape,
you need to know that."

1144
01:10:56,093 --> 01:10:59,830
I think, a month after it happened, 
they made me go on a hike with him,

1145
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:02,390
and I tried having everybody advocate
for me to not make me go

1146
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,219
because I just couldn't deal
with seeing him.

1147
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:06,627
So their solution to that 
was to put him in front of me,

1148
01:11:06,627 --> 01:11:09,940
so that I could see him the whole time.
So that I could know where he was

1149
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,557
and know that he 
wasn't able to do anything

1150
01:11:11,557 --> 01:11:13,093
because he was standing 
right in front of me.

1151
01:11:13,093 --> 01:11:15,571
And I remember thinking the entire time
we were up on the hills,

1152
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,707
up at Camp Pendleton,
if only it was steeper,

1153
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:20,295
I would have jumped.

1154
01:11:20,295 --> 01:11:22,291
- There's no way out of it, 
I mean if you think about it,

1155
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:25,934
the only way out of it 
is like suicide or AWOL.

1156
01:11:25,934 --> 01:11:30,506
Those are your only two options.
Suicide, AWOL or deal with it.

1157
01:11:30,506 --> 01:11:35,363
- Right now, I'm just barely 
appreciating

1158
01:11:35,363 --> 01:11:38,193
learning how to appreciate 
being a woman again.

1159
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:44,736
That's 11 years, 
and I'm trying to have fun with it,

1160
01:11:44,736 --> 01:11:53,781
not forcing myself to have fun. 
I'm trying really hard not to cry

1161
01:11:53,781 --> 01:11:56,501
but it just pisses me off.

1162
01:11:56,501 --> 01:12:02,782
Watching you girls having to go
through what I have

1163
01:12:02,782 --> 01:12:04,754
it makes me want to explode.

1164
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:08,041
- Being here, knowing that 
me wanting to commit suicide,

1165
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:11,889
I'm not alone. Me being hit and raped, 
I'm not alone. Everything --

1166
01:12:11,889 --> 01:12:15,551
the way that they treated me, the way 
that they made me feel, I'm not alone.

1167
01:12:15,551 --> 01:12:18,417
And we have all of you guys, with all 
of your knowledge and everything

1168
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:22,172
you guys are going to stand right up, 
you know, that's awesome.

1169
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:27,622
That's all I'm saying.

1170
01:12:27,622 --> 01:12:29,396
- I think the women who are 
coming forward

1171
01:12:29,396 --> 01:12:31,917
in this law suit are very courageous,

1172
01:12:31,917 --> 01:12:37,143
because they're putting their names
out there for criticism;

1173
01:12:37,143 --> 01:12:40,168
they're putting their names out there

an offender had committed an offense,

1236
01:15:55,796 --> 01:15:58,358

other members in the service.

This week, 17 veterans are saying

She now suffers from PTSD

due to nerve damage in her face.

1269
01:17:24,762 --> 01:17:29,435
Cioca later told the press, 
"It's like they didn't care."

01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:33,030
"It wasn't important,

1274
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:51,107
Has anybody told you what to
watch for or anything?

1275
01:17:51,107 --> 01:17:52,216
- [Waitress] My boyfriend's in the navy.

1276
01:17:52,216 --> 01:17:53,666
- [Kori] So, he knows how tough 
it is for women.

he knows I can take care of myself.

You try to take care okay? 
You can still back out.

Serving your country is great.

01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:43,716
There are great people in it,
and then there are people

01:18:43,716 --> 01:18:46,740
who will end up ruining your life.

1294

- [Ariana] Just the other day,
I saw a girl running along the road.

1295
01:18:52,218 --> 01:18:55,069
She looked like she
was about high school age.

1296
01:18:55,069 --> 01:19:03,799
She was wearing a USMC T‐shirt, 
and I thought that, if she joins,

1297
01:19:03,799 --> 01:19:09,812
then she's going to have to accept rape 
and destruction of her life.

1298
01:19:09,812 --> 01:19:12,988
I cannot in good faith, 
I cannot recommend

1299
01:19:12,988 --> 01:19:17,880
anyone to join with the way 
the organization is set up now.

1300
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,187
I would not wish that on anyone.

1301
01:19:21,187 --> 01:19:23,160
<i>- [Rep. Chellie Pingree] You can't askwomen to serve and then say,</i>

"Oh by the way, if you get in one 
of these horrendous situations,

we won't be there to back you up 
or to help you."

1304
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:32,686
- When I would do nominations
for the Air Force Academy,

1305
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:35,683
you know, it was difficult to talk 
to parents and say,

1306
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:39,441
"Don't worry, if you send her here. 
she's not going to get raped."

1307
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,083
- No. I would tell my daughter 
not to join the military.

1308
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:45,995
They have good things to offer 
but a rape is not one of them.

1309
01:19:46,386 --> 01:19:50,657
- Not in my lifetime. 
She's not joining, no.

1310
01:19:50,657 --> 01:19:55,080
- I would be terrified if my daughter 
wanted to join the military.

1311
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,234
I would have a serious long talk 
with here and hopefully, she'd --

1312
01:19:58,234 --> 01:20:01,633
the one thing is 
that's what she'd listen to.

1313
01:20:01,633 --> 01:20:05,294
- Losing even one soldier,
needlessly

1314
01:20:05,294 --> 01:20:08,347
because of military sexual
trauma, is one too many.

Effective October 20th 2009. 
My overall combined rating is 70%.

- I'll be right there, Shey.

1330
01:21:26,124 --> 01:21:29,949
My face doesn't have any disks in it, 
that's what the x‐rays show.

1331

That's what Dr. Carper's letter show.

- Uh-huh, I will.

1338
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:59,963
- If you do not agree with our decision 
you should write us and tell us why.

1339
01:21:59,963 --> 01:22:01,218
- 'Cause you're an asshole.

1340
01:22:01,218 --> 01:22:03,199
- And you should identify specific issues.

1341
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,719
- You're an idiot.

1342
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,105
- The evidence that was reviewed 
showed that you served, whatever

1343
01:22:08,105 --> 01:22:10,452
which is less than minimum 
active duty requirements

But it wasn't your choice.

I know, I feel the same way, Shea.

<i>- [Dr. Kaye Whitley] It's nice to seeyou again and thank you for coming.</i>

1351
01:22:41,842 --> 01:22:45,553
You have been provided highlights 
of the numbers of the report

1352
01:22:45,553 --> 01:22:47,024
and I'll walk you through those slides,

1353
01:22:47,024 --> 01:22:50,259
then I'm going to play a short 
public service announcement

1354
01:22:50,259 --> 01:22:52,567
and then we can entertain questions.

1355
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:55,647
I think the prevention aspect 
of sexual assault

1356
01:22:55,647 --> 01:22:58,441
goes back in some ways 
to risk reduction.

1357
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:00,618
<i>- [Kirby] What is risk reduction? </i>

1358
01:23:00,618 --> 01:23:04,799
[Dr. Kaye Whitley] Risk reductions 
are ideas like telling women to --

1359
01:23:04,799 --> 01:23:06,895
if they're going to go somewhere, 
together,

always have a buddy with them.

1361
01:23:09,381 --> 01:23:11,573
<i>- [Kirby] Are there other examplesof risk reduction? </i>

1362
01:23:11,573 --> 01:23:17,402
- I'm not familiar, but that's out 
of my area of expertise.

1363
01:23:17,402 --> 01:23:23,377
$$ August 1, 2011, 
Major General Mary Kay Hertog

1364
01:23:23,377 --> 01:23:25,552
$$replaces Kaye Whitley as the Director of
the Sexual Assault and Prevention Office.

1365
01:23:25,552 --> 01:23:26,779
<i>- [Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] Well,</i>

1366
01:23:26,779 --> 01:23:28,279
I want to continue 
where Dr. Whitley left off.

1367
01:23:28,279 --> 01:23:34,397
Looking at where our focus is and that's 
on prevention as well as response,

1368
01:23:34,397 --> 01:23:37,507
we've really done a very good job there 
and the credit goes to Dr. Whitley

1369
01:23:37,507 --> 01:23:40,513
and her staff that has been working this 
the last five to years years.

1370
01:23:40,513 --> 01:23:42,367
- I don't think the Department of Defense

1371
01:23:42,367 --> 01:23:46,619
has really yet embraced that they have
a sexual assault problem.

1372
01:23:46,619 --> 01:23:49,032
That it's not just an issue 
of a cultural environment

1373
01:23:49,032 --> 01:23:51,596
or that the people at risk 
for sexual assault.

1374
01:23:51,596 --> 01:23:56,054
That their system itself, though, just
does not value the rights of victims

1375
01:23:56,054 --> 01:23:57,654
and doesn't provide them
adequate protection.

1376
01:23:57,654 --> 01:23:59,431
- You know, I have heard 
the accusations as well,

1377
01:23:59,431 --> 01:24:02,512
that you know, commanders 
are sweeping this under the carpet.

1378
01:24:02,512 --> 01:24:05,731
Now, what I would say to the people 
that have come forward to you is,

1379
01:24:05,731 --> 01:24:10,360
if you feel that your commander is 
ignoring what you have asked them to do,

1380
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,954
if they are not taking care of you
within that chain of command,

1381
01:24:12,954 --> 01:24:14,484
you need to go to the DOD,

1382
01:24:14,484 --> 01:24:16,755
the Department of Defense 
Inspector General.

1383
01:24:16,755 --> 01:24:18,843
- The GAO, General Accounting Office,

1384
01:24:18,843 --> 01:24:28,333
just did a study, a report 
and guess what -- not one, not one case,

1385
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:31,937
<i>of more than 2500 has been reviewed</i>

1386
01:24:31,937 --> 01:24:34,022
<i>and investigated by the Inspector General,</i>

1387
01:24:34,022 --> 01:24:37,798
and when asked about that,
the Inspector General said,

1388
01:24:37,798 --> 01:24:40,506
"Well, we have other higher priorities."

1389
01:24:40,506 --> 01:24:44,142
- What you really want is you want 
there to be a system akin

1390
01:24:44,142 --> 01:24:47,618
to a civilian system 
where you go to the police

1391
01:24:47,618 --> 01:24:52,920
and the crime is prosecuted 
by an impartial judicial system.

1392
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,684
- As a commander, you have no favorites.

1393
01:24:54,684 --> 01:24:56,778
You are equally to take care 
of every single person

1394
01:24:56,778 --> 01:24:59,600
in your organization.
That's what command is all about.

1395
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,109
- These are human beings
just like everyobody else.

1396
01:25:02,109 --> 01:25:05,813
You cannot be impartial when you are 
already involved

1397
01:25:05,813 --> 01:25:07,787
with people in other settings.

1398
01:25:07,787 --> 01:25:10,246
- I would take exception 
with your characterization

1399
01:25:10,246 --> 01:25:14,762
that the disposition of the case 
is based on the relationship

1400
01:25:14,762 --> 01:25:18,803
between the commander
and the alleged perpetrator.

1401
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:23,494
$$ 33% of female soldiers
didn't report their rape

1402
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:26,096
$$ because the person to report to 
was a friend of the rapist.

1403
01:25:26,096 --> 01:25:28,367
- I'm going to speak to you
with my former commander's hat on.

1404
01:25:28,367 --> 01:25:30,321
There is absolutely 
no conflict of interest.

1405
01:25:30,321 --> 01:25:31,967
You do what the right thing is to do.

1406
01:25:31,967 --> 01:25:36,673
$$ 25% of the female soldiers 
didn't report their rape

1407
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:40,570
$$ because the person to report to
is the rapist.

1408
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:43,853
You have other avenues
and if you feel like

1409
01:25:43,853 --> 01:25:45,591
you have not been 
taken care of adequately

1410
01:25:45,591 --> 01:25:47,816
by your commander,
go up through your congressman,

1411
01:25:47,816 --> 01:25:50,437
or congresswoman, 
file a complaint that way.

1412
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:55,990
- You can't go to your congressman
to obtain justice for being raped,

1413
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:59,219
I mean, imagine how silly that is,
imagine if you told civilians that,

1414
01:25:59,219 --> 01:26:02,177
"Oh geez, sorry you were raped, 
go talk to your congressman."

1415
01:26:02,177 --> 01:26:05,297
$$ Many of our closest NATO allies 
no longer allow commanders

1416
01:26:05,297 --> 01:26:09,921
$$ to determine the prosecution 
of sexual assault cases.

1417
01:26:09,921 --> 01:26:12,471
<i>- [Amy] If you could say something to this guy,</i>

1418
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:15,506
<i>what would you want to say to him?</i>

1419
01:26:15,506 --> 01:26:26,689
- I don't know. I don't think
it's affected his life at all.

1420
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:29,808
And people in my old squadron 
that I've talked to,

1421
01:26:30,826 --> 01:26:36,468
they don't see any effect that this had
on him, and that hurts

1422
01:26:36,468 --> 01:26:41,473
because it's a struggle every day 
and it's completely changed who I am.

1423
01:26:41,473 --> 01:26:43,311
[sobbing]

1424
01:26:44,215 --> 01:26:47,441
- I'm really hoping he falls off the
Coast Guard boat and they never find him.

1425
01:26:47,441 --> 01:26:49,090
I'm really hoping for that.

1426
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:54,190
Or there's a poor mishap 
and got chopped up by the prop.

1427
01:26:54,190 --> 01:26:55,002
- That would be great.

1428
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,505
- That would be great.

1429
01:26:56,505 --> 01:26:58,193
- That would be an exciting day.

1430
01:26:58,193 --> 01:26:59,909
- It would. I'd probably celebrate.

1431
01:26:59,909 --> 01:27:01,235
- Right?
- Yeah.

1432
01:27:01,235 --> 01:27:04,419
- I hope this reaches them too, you know.

1433
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:08,178
I hope that somewhere, someone 
sees my face,

1434
01:27:08,861 --> 01:27:12,928
you know, wherever it is, and goes,

1435
01:27:12,928 --> 01:27:16,660
"I know them and they're talking 
about me,"

1436
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:19,786
because they know what they did,
you know.

1437
01:27:19,786 --> 01:27:24,233
And then all they'll have to mutter 
is to some friend that goes,

1438
01:27:24,233 --> 01:27:26,694
"Hey weren't we stationed with her?"

1439
01:27:27,233 --> 01:27:31,255
You know, and then they can't be
a secret anymore.

1440
01:27:31,255 --> 01:27:34,217
So hopefully they have to 
deal with it, too, you know,

1441
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:36,969
in some way, shape or form.

1442
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:42,054
- Most rapists are repetitive criminals.

1443
01:27:42,054 --> 01:27:46,804
It's a kind of crime
that has an obsessive quality

1444
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:48,612
so people do it again and again.

1445
01:27:48,612 --> 01:27:51,283
So the tragedy of that is
that every one of these guys

1446
01:27:51,283 --> 01:27:55,316
who gets off freely, will be doing it 
to other women, again and again,

1447
01:27:55,316 --> 01:27:57,445
often for years and years and years.

1448
01:27:57,445 --> 01:28:01,516
- The average sex offender 
in their lifetime has about 300 victims,

1449
01:28:01,516 --> 01:28:04,669
and the vast majority of sex offenders
will never be caught.

1450
01:28:04,669 --> 01:28:09,749
- A lot of civilians see it as being 
a military problem, but it really isn't.

1451
01:28:09,749 --> 01:28:16,394
Because 5% or less 
of reported offenders are convicted,

1452
01:28:16,394 --> 01:28:20,716
so almost none of them wind up
on the sex offender registry.

1453
01:28:20,716 --> 01:28:23,123
- There is no military sex offender list
that I'm aware of,

1454
01:28:23,123 --> 01:28:26,763
but if you're convicted in court, 
a felony conviction of sex offense

1455
01:28:26,763 --> 01:28:30,052
of a sex offense, you're going 
to go on the national list.

1456
01:28:30,052 --> 01:28:31,704
<i>- [Kirby] For any sex offense whatsoever? </i>

1457
01:28:31,704 --> 01:28:32,801
- Correct.

1458
01:28:32,801 --> 01:28:37,144
- That is not the case. It depends on 
what level of conviction they got.

1459
01:28:37,144 --> 01:28:40,455
<i>If they received over a year,then that's considered a felony.</i>

1460
01:28:40,455 --> 01:28:43,596
<i>But a lot of these cases are plead down, </i>

1461
01:28:43,596 --> 01:28:45,867
<i>so that they're not felonies.</i>

1462
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:49,657
The military doesn't like
to prosecute people

1463
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:53,382
and keep them as felony convictions.

1464
01:28:53,382 --> 01:28:57,054
- I often ask myself the question, 
"Why would they stop?"

1465
01:28:57,054 --> 01:28:59,807
And if there's nothing to stop them
like incarceration,

1466
01:28:59,807 --> 01:29:03,477
or some other major life change,
