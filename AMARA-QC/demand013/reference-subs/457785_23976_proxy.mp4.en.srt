How depressing is this.

[laughter]

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Forty years in 
the fucking business

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is where you end up.
[audience laughter]

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just to show you...
[audience laughter]

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My daughter and I are very close;
very, very close.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But I brought her up all wrong.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I brought her up to have morals.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She turned down doing 
Playboy magazine cover,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how about that?

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Four hundred thousand dollars,
naked to the waist.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Turned it fuckin' down
and calls me up for approval.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For approval!

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Mother, I turned down
Playboy. What do you think?"

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you know, what do I think?

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm very proud of you, Melissa.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What do I think?

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What do I think,
you stupid, fucking cunt!

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What do I think?
[audience laughter]

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think you should ask
200,000 more

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and show your pussy! 
That's what I think!

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[audience applause and laughter]

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm a 75 year old woman
I'll be ___ drums in Queens!

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What do I think?
[audience laughter]

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm not a fucking red __
with a hot stunt

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
----
where are you from?

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Got a lucky charm.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Who the fuck are you?

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[audience applause and laughter]

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[music]

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A year in the life of 
a semi-legend.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Not good. This is not good.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have no Vegas, no giant club date.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Kathy Griffin's taken all 
those away.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I have the play, which is
not giving me any money.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Can we get club gigs?
Can't Billy get club gigs?

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999


57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this is not a full book.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Like a little date here and there.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Yeah.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Sure.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- These were the good years.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- These were the good years.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- See this is the kind of a book I like.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now that's a good page.
You know what I mean?

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Ten o'clock, eleven o'clock.
Twelve thirty, this and that.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's happiness.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Last year was a very difficult year.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I was playing Here We Go,
the Bronx at 4:30 in the afternoon.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That was a real good one.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll show you fear.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's fear.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If my book ever looked like this,
it would mean that nobody wants me,

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That everything I ever tried to do
in life didn't work.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Nobody cares and I've been 
totally forgotten.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- When you say Joan, I get ___
hold on let me put my sunglasses on

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because the white of the page
hurts my eyes.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, that's a joke. 
So we used to laugh at that.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Hold on, let me get my sunglasses."

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Okay, what day?

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- You don't have to.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Humor me.
