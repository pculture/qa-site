I tried to be two daughters,

telling me that being strong, smart,

To be a woman meant constantly striving

A national problem.

222
00:13:56,671 --> 00:14:00,035
- The more women and girls

Women who are high self-objectifiers

Political efficacy is the idea that

00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:17,503
- [Marie Wilson] Women have been actually
creating the best public policy in America

295
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:19,830
in every state and community
of this country.

296
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,838
The living wage campaigns,
Micro-Enterprise, safety,

297
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:26,118
everything that needed different thinking,
women have been doing it,

298
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,189
so we gotta get them
in the tables of power.

299
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:31,108
- [Condoleezza Rice] Well, two things 
have to happen when you talk about

300
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:34,687
women moving to the next rung
or minorities moving to the next rung.

301
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,999
First, we have to have the candidates.

302
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:39,248
You have to have people
who are in the pools

303
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:41,196
from which these positions are drawn.

304
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:44,286
But you also have to have a kind 
of psychological breakthrough

305
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:51,386
or can an American see a woman
born African-American in that position?

306
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:55,349
Now I think with women,
we still have a bit to go.

307
00:18:57,684 --> 00:19:00,784
- [Jennifer] I knew these obstacles 
still existed from my generation,

308
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,617
<i>but I wanted to find out </i>
if things were any better

309
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,933
for young women
seeking leadership positions.

310
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:10,403
So I spent time with an exceptional 
young woman named, Devanshi Patel,

311
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,456
who aspires to have 
a career in public service.

312
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:15,790
- [Devanshi Patel]
"Well, welcome to Bill Hearing.

313
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,886
Tonight is the bill hearing night for

314
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:21,280
The Central Silicon Valley YMCA 
Youth and Government Delegation."

315
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:25,517
So, first time I ran for public office 
was in 4th grade.

316
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,513
My parents award with me.
We made all these flyers

317
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:32,306
with all these cute little slogans
and we campaigned all over the school,

318
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:36,397
and I was actually the runner-up 
by a handful of votes.

319
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,377
I think everyone is born with something

320
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,832
that they have to do 
and for me, this was it.

321
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:43,585
Every time that I could run for something,
I didn't run for anything less.

322
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:46,125
I didn't run for Vice President 
or Treasurer. I ran for President.

323
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:48,870
- <i>[Ranna Patel] I asked her one day. </i>
I think it was in 5th grade.

324
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,441
<i>I said, "Devanshi, you always want</i>
to be a leader,

325
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,437
<i>but do you know what a leader is?"</i>

326
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,598
She says, "It's very simple, Mama.
They are just servants to people.

327
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:00,134
Leaders are just servants to people."

328
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:03,423
- [Devanshi] I loved the Youth 
and Government program.

329
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:06,991
The best way I can give back
is by running for Youth Governor.

330
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,123
- [speaker] How would you solve 
the California Budget Crisis?

331
00:20:10,123 --> 00:20:11,282
Starting with Ms. Patel.

332
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:13,248
- [Devanshi] I would cut 
unnecessary spending.

333
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,826
Well, when I was running for office, 
there were a lot of--

334
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:19,770
if not outward shows of sexism,
little remarks here and there, like

335
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:21,678
you know, "Oh, she speaks well 
for a woman.

336
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,553
She's smart for a woman."

337
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:26,215
There were also a couple instances
with some of my friends

338
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:29,237
<i>when they were going to speak </i>
in front of a large audience

339
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:32,080
<i>and the only thing people could</i>
focus on was their body,

340
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,443
<i>what they looked like,</i>
what they were wearing.

341
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,748
I thought, you know, 
"We're better than this."

342
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:43,227
$$ Devanshi lost the election to one of 
her male opponents, coming in second.

343
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:49,811
- [Ranna Patel] She said,"Mama,
looks like I'm another Hilary Clinton."

344
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,280
- [Oliver Mittelstaedt] 
Guys will vote for guys.

345
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,136
And girls would vote for guys,
but some other time,

346
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:56,261
girls have a harder time getting
the girls do vote girls because

347
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,796
I feel like, girls are 
kinda harder on other girls.

348
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:02,040
$$ 65% of the 2000 teens who vote
in California's YMCA

Youth &amp; Government program are girls.

350
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:10,067
<i>- [Jennifer] Devanshi's story made me </i>
think about how early

351
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,404
<i>girls face a deep gender bias.</i>

352
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:15,918
<i>And how things have not changed</i>
as much as we'd like to think.

353
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,328
- [Gavin Newsom] One of the first things
I did when I became Mayor of San Francisco

354
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:23,972
is I appointed a female police chief
and then a female fire chief.

355
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,519
When they both show up at the podium,
in a disaster, a lot of national media

356
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,785
would look there and say,
"Well, where is the police chief?"

357
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,239
"She's right here."

358
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,904
"And where's the fire chief?"
"Well, she's right here."

359
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:36,770
People thought I was trying 
to make some grand statement,

360
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,584
when in fact, I was actually just hiring 
the most qualified two candidates.

361
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:46,111
The incredible opposition
was coming mostly from women.

362
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:49,523
And those that feel it's much
too soon, too fast,

363
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:52,343
they never would've question 
at how they've been men.

364
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:54,720
- [Caroline Heldman]
Little boys and little girls

365
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,802
when they're seven years old,

366
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:58,467
an equal number want to be
President of the United States

367
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,287
when they grow up, about 30%.

368
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:03,550
<i>But then, you ask the same</i>
question when they're 15

369
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,482
<i>and you see this massive gap emerging.</i>

370
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:07,575
<i>So, we have this gendered socialization,</i>

371
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,678
<i>where politics is considered</i>
to be for men.

372
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,903
<i>Leadership is considered to be</i>
a masculine pursuit

373
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:16,446
and women are discouraged
from pursuing ambitious positions.

$$ You can't be what you can't see.
-Marian Wright Edelman

375
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,249
- [Carol Jenkins] I think what happens is
that if you do not have women there,

376
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:32,074
then girls do not see
that they can be that.

377
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:37,199
So, it's really what you see 
that inspires your idea of

378
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,130
what's possible for you in the world.

379
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:41,693
- [Krystal Ball] "I do disagree
with Sarah Palin on a lot of issues,

380
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,879
but seeing her up on stage there
with her young family

381
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:47,503
and her young baby was just beautiful.

382
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:50,126
And I thought, 'You know what? 
Maybe I could give this a shot as well.'"

383
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:55,821
$$ 68% of viewers were more likely
to accept a female president

384
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:59,782
- [Marie Wilson] Having this opportunity 
to see women, to see women leadership,

385
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,735
to see women's leadership in reality
and on the screen

386
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:06,095
and on the television, 
is huge for women. Huge.

387
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:09,604
Because you don't have that 
many women really in leadership.

388
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:12,309
So the way that it gets done
to a certain extent

389
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,723
and way problems get solved 
often have to do with Hollywood.

390
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:19,138
And the films that get made. 
The documentaries, the television shows,

391
00:23:19,177 --> 00:23:23,118
start where people are
and people are watching television.

392

- <i>[Jennifer] There are some examples</i>

$$ CANCELLED AFTER ONE SEASON

396
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:41,249
I decided to pursue acting
professionally at the age of 28.

397
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:44,146
And was hopeful I could find
complex roles to play.

398
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:48,368
My first reality check came when 
my agent told me to lie about my age

399
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:51,691
and remove my Stanford MBA 
from my resume

400

because it might be threatening.

401

Well, I didn't do either.

402
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:58,047
But my confidence was really shaken.

403
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,276
My second reality check came when

448
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:26,969
there were only 13 female protagonists
in animated movies.

449

All of them, except one,
had the aspiration of finding romance.

450

<i>Hire the smart, fat girl."</i>

457
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,706
- The whole movie is about 
bringing her down a peg

458
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:07,013
and this is generally done by someone
who is under her, a subordinate,

459
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:10,507
typically a male, so that image 
doesn't bode well,

460

of women in leadership.

461

than we do now.

463
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:24,454
And we allowed women to really
embody all the conrtadictions

00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:26,298
<i>that make up a human being</i>

And then turn and be the saint.
And we accepted that.

469
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:40,632
They were complex human beings.

470

willing to put ourselves

475
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:59,183

and women, I think, terrify us.

she's used as a sexual object or the
object of desire a lot toward the men,

485
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,354
which I think should change a lot

486
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:34,664

to women than just a body.

- "I think you look like a ho."

586
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,891
- "Slap me, bitch."
- "Or what?"

587
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:19,148
- "You motherfucking whore!"

588
00:34:19,502 --> 00:34:23,539
- <i>This notion that women </i>
are natural enemies vying for

589
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:28,492
<i>the prize of being more beautiful</i>
than the rest or the love of whoever,

590
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,953
is so counter to women in real life.

591
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:36,305
- <i>"Please, pick me, pick me, pick me. </i>
See how beautiful I am."

592
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,603
<i>- [M. Gigi Durham] There's a really </i>
unequal power relationship going on there,

593
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:41,904
<i>where it's the girls whose bodies </i>
are on display and the boys

594
00:34:41,904 --> 00:34:43,521
<i>get the power to arbitrate and judge,</i>

595
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:45,809
whether their bodies
are acceptable or not acceptable,

596
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:47,377
<i>desirable or not desirable. </i>

597
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,849
So, I think there's 
a whole lot going on there

598
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,583
that actually puts girls in 
a really disempowered position.

599
00:34:52,996 --> 00:34:55,792
- <i>[Jennifer Pozner] These shows over</i>
the course of the last decade,

600
00:34:55,792 --> 00:35:00,097
have tried to portray a world in which, 
the only options available to women

601
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:04,081
mimic the 1950s model of femininity, 
in which women's only power

602
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:07,297
was her beauty, in which women
not only had no choices,

603
00:35:07,297 --> 00:35:11,153
<i>but shouldn't have even wanted any, </i>
in which men wore burdens

604
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:13,585
<i>with the responsibility of being</i>
the prince charming,

605
00:35:13,585 --> 00:35:17,132
<i>who comes in and whisks women away </i>
to happily ever after.

606
00:35:17,176 --> 00:35:19,628
<i>Then has to provide for their </i>
financial security.

607
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:25,181
Nobody wins in this model, but
women particularly, lose in this model,

608
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:28,371
where they're expected to look
like Miss USA, have sex

609
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:31,161
like Samantha on <i>Sex and the City</i>
and think like June Cleaver.

610
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:39,540
- <i>[Jennifer] And here's something I find </i>
even more disheartening.

611
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:41,490
<i>Watching the news.</i>

612
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:45,866
<i>So many female journalists</i>
are objectified or sexualized.

613
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:53,659
- <i>♪ [CBS theme music ] ♪ This is the CBS</i>
Evening News with Katie Couric.

614
00:35:56,158 --> 00:35:58,914
- "Hi, everyone. I'm very happy
to be with you tonight."

615
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:02,578
<i>- [Carol Jenkins] Katie Couric was </i>
the very first national experience

616
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:07,026
we had all together viewing.
The woman who was not entertaining us,

617
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,234
<i>but whose presence and presentation</i>

618
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,827
<i>was vital for anything information </i>
that we needed.

619
00:36:11,858 --> 00:36:14,670
- [Katie Couric] The three major
evening newscasts had been

620
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,694
dominated by white males.

621
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:19,162
<i>They had very similar faces </i>

622
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:22,054
<i>and very similar backgrounds</i>
for the most part.

623
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:25,356
I thought this is an opportunity 
to mix it up a little bit.

624
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:28,732
I also thought it was an important message
that a woman could be as confident

625
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:32,843
as a man in an important powerful role.

626
00:36:33,054 --> 00:36:34,266
- [Carol Jenkins] And I remember 
in the early days,

627
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:36,330
when I would get calls 
from reporters about,

628
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,950
"Ah! That we have our
first woman anchor.

629
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,293
What do you think about that?"

630
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:43,078
Inevitably, the questions 
that they would ask first, were,

631
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,335
<i>"What about those legs?"</i>

632
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,286
<i>"Do you think she was </i>
showing too much leg?", or

633
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:49,553
"What about that winter white, 
wasn't that a big mistake?"

634
00:36:49,553 --> 00:36:53,125
<i>They were all observations</i>
that had to do with her physicality

635
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,108
and not really about the content at all.

636
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:57,606
But again it's because 
as I've always said,

637
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,999
"We are a nation of teenage boys."

638
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:03,275
We don't know, you know, 
what to make of this woman

639
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:06,799
sitting in front of us and so you know,
we look at her legs, her boobs,

640
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:10,599
her hair, her whatever, you know.
Then maybe way down the line,

641
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:14,011
we'll get to listen to what she's saying.

642
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:15,968
- [Rachel Maddow] Ever since
I've been in media at all,

643
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:18,624
even since, you know, 
the first morning show that I was on

644
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:22,367
in Holyoke, Massachusetts, you know,
I was this sidekick newsgirl.

645
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,510
There's been like 
a really consistent proportion of--

646
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,256
I don't even know if I call it criticism.
Essentially, it's hate mail.

647
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:34,026
As I've become sort of better known
and I get more feedback,

648
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:37,211
the amount of 
"I hate you, homophobic.

649
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,499
I hate what you look like.
I'm gonna kill you."

650
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:45,835
Like threatening mail stuff, 
it's like the proportions

651
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,164
has stayed exactly the same.

652
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:52,311
It's always 14% of the feedback
and it's almost all of the hate mail

653
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:56,981
is about gender and sexuality.
I mean, who has the time

654
00:37:56,981 --> 00:37:59,677
if that's really what you think
and you really are that bad a speller,

655
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,654
like you really, you're still gonna 
take this time to let me know

656
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:06,737
what you 'thunk' about--
[laughs] about what I look like?

657
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:13,010
- [Lisa Ling] It's the scrutinization 
that women get

658
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:17,447
that far surpasses 
the scrutinization that men get.

659
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:22,719
I don't ever see gossip columns 
or tabloids reporting

660
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:27,222
on Brian Williams' personal life, 
yet Katie Couric

661
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:32,718
and what she is wearing
or who she's dating is headline news.

662
00:38:33,493 --> 00:38:36,158
- [Katie Couric] I think whenever there
are two women who are working

663
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:41,818
in similar professions, it's
automatically positioned as a cat fight.

664
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:45,350
Diane Sawyer and I were pitted
against each other as if, you know,

665
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,545
we were gonna be in a mud wrestling
competition on the weekends.

666
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:52,912
And you never saw that with say, 
Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings.

667
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:55,710
- "Take it away with the red hot boys
in blue, which--"

668
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,948
- "I got this one down."

669
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:57,762
- "Okay, good."

670
00:38:57,762 --> 00:39:00,090
- Sometimes I look on 
the cable news channels.

671
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:05,226
I see women wearing very low cut shirts
and lots of makeup

672
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:09,322
and you know, their hair is kind of
tussled and they look like

673
00:39:09,322 --> 00:39:13,006
they're working as cocktail waitresses,
instead of newscasters.

674
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:16,400
It's just a very mixed message.

675
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:17,981
- [Jay Leno] "Folks, we're gonna 
play a game.

676
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,513
I'm gonna show you
a photo of a woman.

677
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:20,709
You have to guess,
whether she is

678
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:24,055
a professional newscaster
or a Hooters waitress.

679
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:25,464
Are you ready? Here we go."
[audience laugh]

680
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:27,989
- [Jennifer Pozner] The local news 
anchorships look like,

681
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:31,376
you know, somebody's grandfather
and his second wife.

682
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:35,290
- [Katie Couric] Television's a 
very visual medium, obviously,

683
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,182
and it's kind of how do you 
walk the fine line

684
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:43,138
of looking pleasing and attractive,
but also looking professional.

685
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:46,315
I look back on my <i>Today's Show</i>
interviews then I think,

686
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:48,658
"Geez, my skirt is way too short."

687
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,825
I sometimes worry that I started 
this thing with my legs and everything

688
00:39:54,594 --> 00:39:59,431
that I have sort of started this trend
of trying to look, you know...

689
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:00,634
I don't know.

690
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:05,138
- [Lisa Ling] There is so much pressure
to look a certain way.

691
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:10,644
When I'm on television, I never try 
and explicitly dress sexy.

692
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:13,812
I don't want to distract from 
the stories that I'm telling.

693
00:40:14,174 --> 00:40:15,678
- [Rachel Maddow] I want you 
to focus on what I'm saying.

694
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:17,726
There's a lot of words in my show
and I work really hard

695
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:20,132
on getting them in the right order.
[laughs]

696
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:21,717
For some people, I will always be

697
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:24,578
too hideous a creature
to be on television. That's fine.

698
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:27,821
But if you can get over that on day one,
it's gonna stay the same

699
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:29,453
for the whole time that I'm on the air.

700
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,964
- [Katie Couric] I think it's really hard 
for women today.

701
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,571
- <i>[Jennifer] The emphasis on </i>
women's appearance affects

702
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:39,807
<i>more than just women on screen.</i>

703
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:44,808
<i>It's affecting women's ability</i>
to participate in the political process.

704
00:40:46,252 --> 00:40:51,688
<i>Ironically, the more power women gain,</i>
the stronger the backlash against them.

705
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,388
- <i>And this phenomenon is most evident </i>

706
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:57,873
<i>in the way the media disrespects </i>
our female leaders.

707
00:40:59,654 --> 00:41:01,835
- "She's irresistibly cute. 
Let's put it that way.

708
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:05,186
In the way she presents herself, 
obviously, she's attractive and all that."

709
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:07,215
- "Sarah Palin looks 
really hot in that hat.

710
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:12,627
She's just sad that she
doesn't know how cars work.

711
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:15,285
Aww, that's crazy.
Have you seen the hat on her?"

712
00:41:15,718 --> 00:41:19,336
- "Both you and Sarah Palin 
are good looking women.

713
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,513
I mean, you're attractive, young,
relatively young women.

714
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,917
-"Kagan is gonna put on the
US Supreme Court

715
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:27,862
as there's such a thing about
the aesthetics of the appointee.

716
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:29,438
Let's put that here that so 
she's not your type of face

717
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:31,106
you'd wanna see 
on the five dollar bill."

718
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,098
- "I think I'm gonna send
Sotomayor and her club

720

to help them clean up
after their meetings."

721
00:41:38,274 --> 00:41:41,259
- "Cynthia McKinney, the former 
congresswoman from Georgia

722
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:43,147
was another angry black woman."

723
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:45,494
- "Look at these ugly skanks who make up

724
00:41:45,494 --> 00:41:48,797
the big female leadership 
of the democratic party."

725
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,202
- "You know that ugly hag,
Madeleine Albright, remember her?

726
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,653
A psycho. She was the Secretary 
of State under Clinton, remember?

727
00:41:54,653 --> 00:41:56,144
Like a fat moron."

728
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,113
- "And now we have the wicked witch
of the west, you know, that Nancy Pelosi."

729
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:03,335
- "I think if speaker Pelosi were still 
incapable of human facial expression,

730
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:04,997
we'd see she'd be embarrassed."

731
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:07,873
- "Nancy Pelosi, that--
Get another face lift, lady.

732
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:10,585
Another reason why it's very rare.

733
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:13,083
The final woman worthy
of serving in political off--"

734
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:16,967
<i>♪ Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead ♪</i>
- "And it's bye bye, Pelosi."

735
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:20,373
- "And Hilary Rodham Clinton,
her thighness, is no better

736
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,008
than Dumbo with the big ears."

737
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,340
- "When she raises her voice
and when a lot of women do, you know,

738
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,228
it's as I say, it reaches a point where--
- "Yeah, well, look, you know what?"

739
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:31,711
--with every husband in America
has heard it one time or another."

740
00:42:31,772 --> 00:42:34,833
- "You get a woman in the oval office, 
the most powerful person in the world,

741
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:37,148
what's the downside?"

742
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:39,740
- "You mean, besides the PMS 
and the mood swings."

743
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,826
- [Pat Mitchell] There's probably 
no more powerful influence

744
00:42:44,826 --> 00:42:48,489
in the way we view power than 
the way media treats power.

745
00:42:48,643 --> 00:42:52,687
And media treats power 
as defined by men,

746
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:56,314
because it has been
throughout our generation

747
00:42:56,314 --> 00:42:58,918
and the ones before 
generally define that way.

748
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:01,679
- [Erika Falk] When press representations 
of women who are, you know,

749
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,542
running for the highest office 
in the land are focusing, for example,

750
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:09,054
on how women look, 
instead of what they've done

751
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,815
or their issue positions. 
That's got to impact the audience

752
00:43:12,815 --> 00:43:15,393
in terms of how they evaluate 
and judge those women.

753
00:43:15,582 --> 00:43:17,891
One of the things it does 
is it trivializes them.

754
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:20,298
It makes women seem less powerful.

755
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,402
- [Jennifer Pozner] During the
Democratic National Convention in '84,

756
00:43:23,423 --> 00:43:25,513
when Geraldine Ferraro was running,

757
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:27,975
she was introduced on
national television as,

758
00:43:27,975 --> 00:43:31,767
"The first female vice presidential
candidate. Size six!"

759
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:34,975
So this is not new.

760
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:38,250
- [Debbie Walsh] My colleague did a study 
looking at Elizabeth Dole

761
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,897
and her race for President,
she was coming in second in Iowa

762
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:46,282
at the time after George Bush 
and there was much more coverage

763
00:43:46,282 --> 00:43:51,550
of her appearance than there was of the 
substance of what she was talking about.

764
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:54,858
- [Jennifer Lawless] When I ran for
Congress, I was campaigning

765
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:59,421
at grocery stores and a woman came up 
to me and she put her arms around me

766
00:43:59,457 --> 00:44:02,602
and she whispered, "Don't worry, 
you don't look nearly as fat in real life

767
00:44:02,602 --> 00:44:05,981
as you do on TV." 
The week before the election,

768
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:08,667
a man came up to me and he said, 
"You know, you seem great,

769
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:11,472
but I don't feel like
I could vote for you for Congress.

770
00:44:11,472 --> 00:44:13,356
I feel like I should hire you
as a babysitter."

771
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:16,259
- [Nancy Pelosi] When I first ran for
public office, which is now

772
00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:20,314
over 20 years ago, although my 
youngest was a senior in high school,

773
00:44:20,314 --> 00:44:22,329
the question I was most 
frequently asked was,

774
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:24,447
"Who's gonna be taking care 
of your children?"

775
00:44:24,648 --> 00:44:26,688
And of course it's one of
those questions that

776
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:30,325
I don't think a man has ever been asked
when he has run for office.

777
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,147
- [Erika Falk] If you look at
the women who ran,

778
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:35,000
who had honorary titles like, 
Senator Clinton,

779
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:40,156
if the press drops that title and 
instead refers to them as Mrs. Clinton,

780
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:43,064
this is a way to kind of diminish 
some of her accomplishments.

781
00:44:43,363 --> 00:44:47,367
$$ In John Boehner's first four weeks 
as Speaker of the House

782
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:51,407
$$ he was on the cover of five 
national weekly magazines.

783
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:53,331
$$ In Nancy Pelosi's four years
as Speaker of the House

784
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:55,073
$$ she was on the cover of zero
national weekly magazines.

785
00:44:55,227 --> 00:44:57,820
- [Dianne Feinstein] There is such a thing
as a media bias.

786
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,833
For example, media will write in the
same way about a man and a woman.

787
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:07,031
Senator X is a woman, 
complained that--

788
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:11,802
and in the same thing, 
Senator Y, stated that--

789
00:45:12,364 --> 00:45:14,315
So the man will get the <i>stated</i>

790
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:18,264
and the woman will get
the negative verb, <i>complained.</i>

791
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:23,155
- [Erika Falk] Women were twice as likely 
to be described emotionally as were men.

792
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:28,935
And by painting women as more emotional
than men, we perpetuate this stereotype

793
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,147
that women are emotional. 
Therefore, they're irrational.

794
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:32,977
Therefore they can't handle a crisis.

795
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:35,237
Therefore, they should not be
in leadership positions.

796
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:38,984
- [Condoleezza Rice] I remember 
so many times during the campaign,

797
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:42,210
people asking, "Will she tough enough
to be Commander-in-Chief?"

798
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,423
Well, I've know plenty of men who aren't 
tough enough to be Commander-in-Chief

799
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,628
and nobody asked that question.

800
00:45:47,628 --> 00:45:52,990
- "Making sure that these kids 
have a shot at the American dream...

801
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:57,472
[sobbing]
...my God, it's important."

802
00:45:57,694 --> 00:46:00,400
- "Gosh. What do you think 
they would have done to Nancy Pelosi

803
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,118
if she hadn't gotten all worked up?
They would've said she's unstable,

804
00:46:04,123 --> 00:46:08,326
couldn't do the job. 
Ooh, yes. Welcome to America."

805
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,133
- [Pat Mitchell] A woman in power 
is often seen as a negative thing.

806
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:20,673
We associate all the worst aspects 
of power and we translate those

807
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:23,948
to a woman seeking to achieve power.

808
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:26,053
- [Caroline Heldman] One of the key ways

809
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:31,109
in which media played a role 
in the primary, was to talk about

810
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:34,373
Hillary Clinton's ambition 
as though it were a bad thing.

811
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:39,831
- "When Barack Obama speaks, 
men hear, 'Take off for the future'.

812
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:44,455
And when Hillary Clinton speaks,
men hear, 'Take out the garbage.'"

813
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:48,098
- "When she reacts the way she reacts
to Obama with just a look,

814
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,487
the look toward him, 
looking like,

815
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:52,769
everyone's first wife standing 
outside a probate court."

816
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,376
- <i>"I don't know what they're </i>
getting at here, Tuck.

817
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:55,686
<i>But what do you think are</i>
they saying about Hillary?"

818
00:46:55,686 --> 00:47:00,048
- "I don't know, but that is so perfect, 
a guy would have often said." [both laugh]

819
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:03,663
"When she comes on television,
I involuntarily cross my legs."

820
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:04,947
- "I know you do."

821
00:47:05,224 --> 00:47:09,381
- Hillary Clinton had hecklers
following her saying, "Iron my shirt."

822
00:47:09,544 --> 00:47:12,048
- "And some people think
- [Hecklers shouting] <i>"Iron my shirt!"</i>

823
00:47:12,048 --> 00:47:16,095
- we bring about saying, I--"
- <i>"Iron my shirt! Iron my shirt!"</i>

824
00:47:16,226 --> 00:47:19,455
- She was frequently called 
a bitch in mainstream media.

825
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:23,168
- "She's a stereotypical bitch,
you know what I mean?"

826
00:47:23,316 --> 00:47:26,913
- "Obama did great in February that was
because it was black history month.

827
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:30,432
And now Hillary is doing much better
because it's white bitch month, right?"

828
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,741
- "If she knew how it made her look,
so alternately sappy and bitchy,

829
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:37,442
she'd stop it, but she can't
help herself, can she?"

830
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:39,637
- Her credentials were 
constantly questioned.

831
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:43,051
- "Let's not forget and I'll be brutal.
The reason she's a US Senator,

832
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:46,187
the reason she's a candidate
for President, the reason she may be

833
00:47:46,187 --> 00:47:47,874
a front runner, is her husband
messed around." -"Yeah, but--"

834
00:47:47,874 --> 00:47:50,827
"That's how she got to be Senator 
for New York. We keep forgetting it.

835
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:52,282
She didn't win there on her merit."

836
00:47:55,297 --> 00:47:57,925
<i>- [Carololine] Sarah Palin presented </i>
a very different image.

837
00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:02,154
She is the first national high profiled
female candidate

838
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:07,547
who presented herself in very
feminine terms as a "real woman."

839
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,960
- "She's the American dream. 
Women want to be her.

840
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,195
Men want to mate with her.
I wanna lay her next to me in bed."

841
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:18,551
- There were pictures shot 
between her legs of folks

842
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:20,579
at the Republican National Convention.

843
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:24,643
In a nutshell, she was
<i>pornified</i> and <i>ditzified</i>

844
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:28,277
"I don't wanna say she's a ditz,
but last night,

845
00:48:28,277 --> 00:48:30,968
my stripper's fake name 
was Sarah Palin." <i>[crowd laughs]</i>

846
00:48:31,356 --> 00:48:34,360
- "Yo, let me tell you somethin' 
'bout Sarah Palin, man, [all laugh]

847
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:38,017
she's good masturbation material."
- [Together] Oh! [all laugh]

848
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,746
- So, Hillary Clinton tried to be 
properly masculine

849
00:48:40,746 --> 00:48:43,387
and properly feminine and she lost.

850
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:48,132
Sarah Palin puts out this different image 
of, shall we say hyper femininity,

851
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:51,370
and she gets beaten up in
really degrading gendered ways.

852
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:57,932
- "But tonight we are crossing party lines
to address the now very ugly role

853
00:48:57,963 --> 00:49:00,985
that sexism is playing in the campaign."

854
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:06,037
- "An issue which I am frankly, surprised 
to hear, people suddenly care about."

855
00:49:06,037 --> 00:49:08,491
<i>[crowd laughs]</i>

856
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,167

that diminish us, like pretty, 
attractive, beautiful--"

858
00:49:16,326 --> 00:49:20,784

<i>[crowd laughs and applauds]</i>

860
00:49:26,136 --> 00:49:30,050

there are millions of people watching

861
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,685
Sarah Palin, Hillary Clinton... 
I could talk to about a lot of women

862
00:49:33,685 --> 00:49:36,098
there in New Jersey politics.
There are millions of young women

863
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,071
watching this and the messages 
that they're getting are just not

864
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,171
conducive to encouraging them
to put up with this kind of abuse.

865
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:47,022
- [Gavin Newsom] When you're not
treated the same, you are dehumanized.

866
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:50,261
When you're not given the same
opportunity, you're dehumanized.

867
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:53,466
When people look at you differently 
because you happen to be a woman

868
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:58,954
and you happen to be in a position 
of some influence that someone who is a man,

869
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,634
would naturally be in based
on tradition or history

870
00:50:02,634 --> 00:50:06,344
and people question your qualifications, 
that's dehumanizing.

871
00:50:06,554 --> 00:50:12,383
- [Thomas] Empowered women in general,
threaten men because they feel

872
00:50:12,383 --> 00:50:15,737
that an empowered woman 
is just putting down a man

873
00:50:15,983 --> 00:50:19,654
as opposed to trying 
to sort of raise herself.

874
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:23,211
- [Jackson Katz] As women have been 
challenging men's power, in business,

875
00:50:23,211 --> 00:50:25,364
in the professions, in education,

876
00:50:25,364 --> 00:50:29,493
and in politics and other areas
of social life,

877
00:50:31,182 --> 00:50:33,300
the images of women that have
been flooding their culture,

878
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,224
have been showing women 
as taking up less space.

879
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:39,061
They're less threatening.
They're highly sexualized.

880
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:42,747
And therefore, a certain kind of power
has been taken away from them,

881
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:44,677
which is a power of being
a whole person.

882
00:50:46,554 --> 00:50:49,894
And I don't think those things
are coincidental. I think that the way

883
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:54,060
that the symbolic realm has been acting 
as to take power away from women,

884
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,354
while women have been challenging
men's power in the concrete realm.

when it misrepresents them.

887

the people behind the scenes

<i>And what are the consequences </i>
for my daughter and her generation?

890
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:48,648
- [Barbara J. Berg] The media
has always been,

891
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:51,029
overwhelmingly,
in the hands of men.

892

stattions and 6% radio stations.

in media, fewer and fewer women

894
00:52:00,346 --> 00:52:03,537
and people of color exist
at every rung of the ladder.

895

$$ Women hold only 3% of clout positions
in telecommunications, entertainment,

897
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,754
- [Carol Jenkins] That means that 97% 
of everything you know about yourself

898
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,822
and about your country and your world,
comes from the male perspective.

899
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:16,684
It doesn't mean that it's wrong,
it just means that in a democracy,

900
00:52:16,684 --> 00:52:20,018
where you talk about equality 
and full participation,

901
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:22,179
you've got half of the population,

902
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:24,441
more than half of the population,
not participating.

"Why don't we just create our own network,

904
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:34,706
other than continuing to try and get our
stories told by other people's networks?"

905
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:39,202
So, we put together an idea.
We went to various distributors,

906
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:42,435
including the broadcast networks, 
the cable companies, etcetera,

907
00:52:42,435 --> 00:52:45,980
pitched the idea 
and one person said to me,

908
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,001
"Well, why do we need
another women's network?

909

We already have one.
We have lifetime."

pervasive sense of denial

912

about the status of women working 
in both television and film.

913
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:10,698
Peter Bart wrote a column in <i>Variety</i>,
talking about the glass ceiling

and how it no longer exists.

915
00:53:13,158 --> 00:53:16,956

other people tend to hire people

who are a reflection of themselves.

923
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:43,402
- [Barbara J. Berg] This impacts hiring. 
It impacts the news, directors,

924
00:53:43,402 --> 00:53:46,330
the journalists, the people who are 
gonna cover the news,

925
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:48,316
and of course, who reports the news?

926
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:53,019
Very much is the factor
in what kind of news is reported.

they have to wonder, "Well,
what part do I play in this culture?"

930
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:10,483
There's actually an 
academic term for that.

It's called, symbolic annihilation.

[nuclear explosion]

933
00:54:29,627 --> 00:54:34,497
- [Geena Davis] All of Hollywood 
is run on one assumption

934
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:39,671
that women will watch stories about men,
but men won't watch stories about women.

935
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:48,795
And all the decisions are made 
based on this concrete fact

936
00:54:48,795 --> 00:54:52,600
and nobody's ever really proved
that that's true.

937
00:54:52,716 --> 00:54:55,772
I think it's a horrible indictment 
of our society, if we assume

938
00:54:55,772 --> 00:55:00,695
that one half of the population
is just not interested in the other half.

939
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:05,102
- [Catherine Hardwicke] The first couple 
of scripts that I wrote, of course,

940
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:09,363
had a female, you know, as a lead
character and people will look,

941
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:12,158
"Well, there's hardly 
any bankable actresses."

942
00:55:12,162 --> 00:55:16,103
So, they can't carry a film. 
So, it has to be super low budget

943
00:55:16,103 --> 00:55:19,939
or we wouldn't bankroll it and no one's 
gonna show up in the theaters

944
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:25,727
and I finally wrote the lowest
budget movie I could ever write.

945
00:55:25,794 --> 00:55:29,087
I co-wrote <i>Thirteen</i> 
with a 13-year old girl

946
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:32,056
<i>and it was about people </i>
of lower income.

947
00:55:32,056 --> 00:55:34,246
<i>They could wear my clothes.</i>
We could shoot in my house.

948
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:37,499
<i>We could use my car. </i>
We made the movie and it went on

949
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:41,461
<i>to Sundance and it went on to win awards</i>
and get international distribution

950
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:44,943
<i>and I think it was the same</i> Twilight.
like, with

951
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:50,116
<i>Two major studios turned it down. </i>
Finally, a new upstart company showed me

952
00:55:50,116 --> 00:55:54,323
<i>the project and it turned into </i>
obviously, a phenomenon making

953
00:55:54,323 --> 00:55:58,395
<i>over half a billion dollars so far.</i>
So, it is proved the theory

954
00:55:58,395 --> 00:56:01,711
<i>that girls and women</i>
wouldn't go to see a movie,

955
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:05,721
but they did go see the movie in droves.
And over and over and over.

956
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:08,641
And bought the DVD 
and even bought pillowcases.

957
00:56:10,357 --> 00:56:13,951
But there is a flip side to that, 
which is kind of astonishing to me.

958
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:17,589
On the next two <i>Twilight,</i>
they've hired guys.

959
00:56:17,765 --> 00:56:21,372
<i>They did not seek out a female director</i>
and on the same side,

960
00:56:21,372 --> 00:56:26,351
I've gone after some jobs that I've been
told flat out to myself and my agent,

961
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:29,197
"Oh no, we think a guy
should direct this."

962
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:32,130
<i>And to me, I think,</i>
"Okay, can a man direct, you know,

963
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,046
Sex and the City, Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants,

964
00:56:34,046 --> 00:56:37,934
<i>the </i>Miley Cyrus<i> movie?"</i>
Nobody ever questions that.

965
00:56:38,124 --> 00:56:41,973
But I, a very successful female 
director, cannot direct a movie

966
00:56:41,973 --> 00:56:43,729
that should be done by a man.

967
00:56:43,913 --> 00:56:45,508
- [Jennifer Todd] But nobody says,
"I'm not gonna hire a female director."

968
00:56:45,508 --> 00:56:49,591
On their list, there's just 25 names
and none of them are women.

969
00:56:49,591 --> 00:56:52,960
- [Paul Haggis] What happens is, 
these studio chiefs who--

970
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,981
or people like myself, you know,
writer, producers or directors,

971
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,927
we see the world in a certain way

972
00:57:00,978 --> 00:57:05,634
and we don't really challenge that often
and so we just replicate the world

973
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:11,747

really asking why we're doing it.

that they tell people when they're,

Create what you know.

<i>When you have greater diversity </i>
behind the scenes,

not only do you get more
female characters on screen,

978
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:26,084
<i>but you get a different kind </i>
of female character.

979
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:30,052
<i>You get a more powerful and </i>
multi dimensional female character.

Truly crafting those stories,

984

writing them down, directing them, 
and giving them to people

[women laughing]

988
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:57,990

what the response was gonna be

989
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,466
to <i>Thelma and Louise.</i>
One time I was at a red light

990
00:58:00,974 --> 00:58:03,691
and I heard this honking
and I looked next to me, and it's

991
00:58:03,706 --> 00:58:06,953
a car full of women who are
popping out of all the windows

992
00:58:06,953 --> 00:58:10,340
and the sunroof and going, 
"Whoo-hoo!"

993
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:13,574
[laughs] I'm like,
"Well this is certainly never been

994
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:16,675
a reaction to my any of my other movies."

995
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:22,459
Then the very next movie I made was
<i>A League of Their Own</i>, where I had

996
00:58:22,459 --> 00:58:26,806
13 or 15 year old girls coming up to me
with the same kind of reactions,

997
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:28,886
"Oh my God. You have no idea 
that movie changed my life.

998
00:58:28,886 --> 00:58:31,150
I played sports 
because of that movie."

999
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:37,554
And it really struck me how few
opportunities we give women to have

1000
00:58:37,554 --> 00:58:39,882
that kind of experience 
watching a movie.

an instrument of change.

1002
00:58:44,198 --> 00:58:49,148
It can maintain the <i>status quo</i>
and reflect the views of the society.

1003
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:54,630
Or it can hopefully awaken people 
and change minds.

1004
00:58:55,474 --> 00:58:58,778
I think it depends on
who's piloting the plane

of privilege and power.

1012

And where women very often
are treated as second-class citizens.

1013

being treated with disrespect,

1298
01:15:25,148 --> 01:15:26,857
if they don't see their fathers doing it,

1299
01:15:26,857 --> 01:15:28,681
if they don't see men in the 
public culture doing it,

1300
01:15:28,681 --> 01:15:33,097
it's not fair to put the burdens on the
shoulders of boys or even young men.

1301
01:15:33,097 --> 01:15:35,513
Even though, they're part of the solution,
there's no question.

we need to be hyper masculine and 
we need to be misogynistic stereotypes.

1305
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:52,840
It really puts a lot of pressure on me 
when I have relatives who have grown up

1306
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:57,857
with this phenomenon, who attempt 
to put me on that path,

1307
01:15:57,857 --> 01:15:59,245
but I'm not ready for it.

1308
01:15:59,345 --> 01:16:02,350
- [Cory Booker] I remember sitting down
having this conversation with a woman

1309
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,438
far wiser than me 
and stories to talk about,

1310
01:16:05,438 --> 01:16:09,573
"Oh, how bad it is for women in America,"
and she just looked at me

1311
01:16:09,573 --> 01:16:11,229
and listened to me 
for a while and she said,

1312
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:12,265
"Well, I have to tell you, Cory,

1313
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:14,426
I actually think it's really bad 
for men in America."

1314
01:16:14,426 --> 01:16:16,185
And I go, "What do you mean?" 
She started talking to me

1315
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:20,042
and really putting the spotlight on me
and talking about how emotionally

1316
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,042
constipated men are taught 
to be very early on,

1317
01:16:23,273 --> 01:16:28,083
how we don't have-- haven't learned 
how to express ourselves in healthy ways,

1318
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:32,957
it often does manifest itself in such 
awful and violent ways.

1319
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:37,050
But she talked about a spiritual healing
that was needed for guys.

"The numbers of women

in our country are still very low."

<i>We have to find a way</i>
to change this culture.

1326
01:17:05,518 --> 01:17:08,189
We need to shift our focus
from the bottom line

1327
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:11,895
<i>to one of social responsibility. </i>
We need to challenge

1328
01:17:11,895 --> 01:17:14,326
<i>the media conglomerates</i>
to value women

1329

<i>for more than their youth, </i>
beauty and sexuality.

1330
01:17:17,957 --> 01:17:20,530
<i>And we must hold</i>
these companies accountable.

1331
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:22,926
<i>We need to encourage women </i>

1332
01:17:22,926 --> 01:17:26,258
<i>to discover their true power,</i>
so they can become leaders.

1333
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:28,521
<i>And we must support them </i>
on their journey.

$$ yet we have no national paid family 
leave, childcare or flex time policy

1336

01:17:52,308 --> 01:17:54,310
role models who look like you.

1341
01:17:55,232 --> 01:18:00,084
If Sally Ride, my dear friend,
first female astronaut had been waiting

1342

for a female astronaut role model,
she would never have done it.

who looked like me on television,

1348
01:18:17,323 --> 01:18:20,204
so I never dreamed 
that I could be on television.

1349

I would love to say, "Yeah, there were
some great women role models back then."

Actually, there were none.

1351
01:18:27,019 --> 01:18:32,298
Years later, Connie Chung went on
television to report in Watergate,

1352
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,987
and I would say to her, 
"Connie, you're my role model."

1353
01:18:34,987 --> 01:18:37,319
She would say to me,
"Jan, but I'm not that old."

1354
01:18:37,468 --> 01:18:39,851
And I say, "Yeah, you're a year 
older than I am, Connie

01:18:39,851 --> 01:18:41,208

making it on her own
and working at that TV station,

1361
01:18:56,347 --> 01:18:59,175
I think was, very, very influential.

1362

- [Rachel Maddow] One of the things
that really surprised me

1363
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:05,616
was the number of women

"Can I take you out to breakfast?" 
"Can I take you out to lunch?"

"Can I make sure that you have 
my phone number or my email address,

01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:16,669

it definitely wasn't like a gender mafia

1368
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:20,732
going on in the media, 
but there was an over effort

1369

that women who had gone before me,

were both happy that I was there

and wanted to be resources to me.

01:23:17,108 --> 01:23:18,961
Oh, she's smiling.

1440
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:25,884
On September 18th 2009, 
I began my journey into motherhood.

1441
01:23:27,594 --> 01:23:29,632
My husband and I have the same wishes

1442
01:23:29,632 --> 01:23:32,870
for Montana that any parents
have for their child.

1443
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:37,147
We want her to pursue her purpose 
and passions in life

1444
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,097
and to understand 
that what's really important

1445
01:23:40,097 --> 01:23:42,734
is who she is on the inside.

1446
01:23:43,753 --> 01:23:46,706
And it's critical to us 
that all girls grow up in a world

1447
01:23:46,706 --> 01:23:48,831
where their voice counts,

1448
01:23:48,962 --> 01:23:52,327
where our culture embraces them 
in all of their diversity

1449
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:55,822
and where they're afforded 
equal opportunities to succeed in life.

1450
01:23:58,306 --> 01:24:00,814
I keep coming back to my early years.

1451
01:24:01,644 --> 01:24:05,953
Too often, we girls and women 
don't recognize our own internal strength.

1452
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:13,975
I now know that we can't let anyone
or anything take our power away from us.

1453
01:24:18,059 --> 01:24:20,238
What do you think, Montana?

1454
01:24:21,573 --> 01:24:23,175
Are you ready?

1455
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:29,970

1456
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:32,820
- If we really want things 
to change around you,

1457
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,730
here's what you can do.

1458

1459
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:41,242
- Measure yourself by accomplishments
and not by how you look.

1460
01:24:41,422 --> 01:24:44,831
- If you and I, every time
we pass a mirror,

1461
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:47,358
downgrade on how we look,
or complain about our looks,

1462
01:24:47,358 --> 01:24:51,851
if we remember that a girl is watching us,
and that's what she's learning.

1463
01:24:52,175 --> 01:24:54,743
- Reflect on the ways you 
may contribute to sexism.

1464
01:24:54,943 --> 01:24:58,695
- I include myself in this. 
We scrutinize the women.

1465
01:24:58,772 --> 01:25:01,325
"God, look how old she's gotten,
look how gray she's gotten.

1466
01:25:01,325 --> 01:25:02,585
What is she wearing?"

1467
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:06,366
I think that as women, we need to stop 
that destructive behavior

1468
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:10,500
that we inflict upon each other
and ultimately onto ourselves.

1469
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:13,643
- Support media that champions 
accomplished women.

1470
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:18,649
- We need strong women role models who
in the media because they did something,

1471
01:25:18,806 --> 01:25:21,126
because they're doing great work, 
not because they have

1472
01:25:21,126 --> 01:25:25,268
the most bangin' body
and they're sexiest woman of 2010.

1473
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,155
They're the best philanthropists.

1474
01:25:27,192 --> 01:25:30,598
They're the best in the medical field
and it's not about the way they look,

1475
01:25:30,598 --> 01:25:32,595
it's about who they are inside.

1476
01:25:33,655 --> 01:25:37,681
- Boycott magazines, TV shows and movies 
that objectify and degrade women.

1477
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:41,687
- Speaking your mind and criticizing
media companies when you think

1478
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:43,783
they're doing things that are 
inappropriate at your children,

1479
01:25:43,783 --> 01:25:47,958
is not just your God-given right
as an American, as a parent,

1480
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:50,979
but it's also entirely consistent 
with the First Amendment.

1481
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:54,080
- Go see movies written 
and directed by women.

1482
01:25:54,565 --> 01:25:59,043
- And it's important to go on opening 
weekend and Friday is best

1483
01:25:59,843 --> 01:26:02,269
because these are the numbers 
that Hollywood tracks.

1484
01:26:02,689 --> 01:26:05,426
- Write your own stories 
and create your own media

1485
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:08,374
about powerful women
in non-traditional roles.

1486
01:26:08,737 --> 01:26:10,929
- My daughter, when she was nine, 
she wrote this little screenplay

1487
01:26:10,929 --> 01:26:13,169
and she shot a movie you know,
with our little video camera,

1488
01:26:13,169 --> 01:26:16,689
with her you know, casting her friends 
and it was just so much fun for her

1489
01:26:16,689 --> 01:26:19,854
and it teaches them that the media 
are a construction.

1490
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,119
And they start to understand

1491
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:23,167
that these are stories that people
are telling them and they can come up

1492
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:25,892
with their own stories to tell back
and very often, they can be you know,

1493
01:26:25,892 --> 01:26:27,920
subversive stories, resistant stories.

1494
01:26:28,196 --> 01:26:31,128
- Teach those around you 
to look at the media critically.

1495
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:36,325
- Well, one thing that I do with my kids, 
is I watch these shows with them,

1496
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:40,305
I say, "Hey, did you notice 
there's only one female in that group?"

1497
01:26:40,373 --> 01:26:44,632
and, "What if that character 
had been a girl, instead?"

1498
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:48,769
and, "Why is she wearing that when
she's trying to rescue somebody?"

1499
01:26:49,476 --> 01:26:52,469
- Ask your school to start 
a media literacy course

1500
01:26:52,469 --> 01:26:54,289
focused on gender issues.

1501
01:26:54,644 --> 01:26:59,104
- We need media literacy as much I think, 
as we need to learn to read.

1502
01:26:59,243 --> 01:27:02,729
Our responses should be, "Whose 
perspectives are framing this story?"

1503
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:05,856
"There are always more than 
two sides to every story."

1504
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,241
"Are we being sold here?"

1505
01:27:08,452 --> 01:27:10,341
- Don't be afraid
to challenge your friends

1506
01:27:10,341 --> 01:27:13,265
if you hear them saying 
derogatory things about women.

1507
01:27:13,477 --> 01:27:17,876
- King said it very eloquently, "The
problem today is not the vitriolic words

1508
01:27:17,876 --> 01:27:19,782
and the evil actions
and the bad people,

1509
01:27:19,782 --> 01:27:23,078
it's the appalling silencing 
and inaction of the good people."

1510
01:27:23,275 --> 01:27:26,299
- Find healthy role models
and be a mentor to others.

1511
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:30,670
- Encourage women to become leaders
- and support them in the process.

1512
01:27:31,023 --> 01:27:35,055
- If we see women who we think
would be excellent at any political job,

1513
01:27:35,055 --> 01:27:38,131
whether it's dog catchers, 
school board member,

1514
01:27:38,131 --> 01:27:42,108
or member of Congress, 
we need to make that known.

1515
01:27:42,663 --> 01:27:46,079
- "Whatever women do, they must do 
twice as well as a man

1516
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:48,776
to be thought of as half as good.

1517
01:27:48,968 --> 01:27:51,841
Luckily, that's not too difficult."

1518

$$ Miss Representation

1520
