      <p begin="00:37:21.162" end="00:37:23.322">Then all of a sudden, I saw this guy stop.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:23.430" end="00:37:24.853">Picked me up, got in the car.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:24.945" end="00:37:29.243">After he drove about a mile or two miles and there was a StateTrooper</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.243" end="00:37:31.885">on the side behind him. And put the siren on and pulled him aside.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:31.885" end="00:37:37.043">One of them came up to me and said, "Can I see your identification?"</p>

      <p begin="00:37:39.613" end="00:37:41.410">I said, "Now that's not my information to give you,</p>

      <p begin="00:37:42.577" end="00:37:45.780">And so he grabbed me, called me a, "Wise Nigger."</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.964" end="00:37:47.708">And he grabbed me and throwed me against the car,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.708" end="00:37:49.293">put the handcuffs on me.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:49.293" end="00:37:51.473">He said, "I'd take you to the woods and bust your brains out.</p>

      <p begin="00:37:53.898" end="00:37:57.488">And I stayed there and then his partner came over and said, "Hey man."</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57.611" end="00:37:59.940">Took him to the side, said something to him.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:00.760" end="00:38:03.379">And then his partner, he kind of apologized to me.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03.610" end="00:38:06.659">Took the handcuffs off me and told me get in the car and go ahead.</p>
