      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- What they did was to figure out&lt;br/&gt;other things that could be done</p>
      <p>with nuclear technology as a possible&lt;br/&gt;check it out.</p>
      <p>And out of that comes crazy nucleus games.</p>
      <p>- Nuclear explosives for a large projects&lt;br/&gt;that are simply not feasible</p>
      <p>with conventional methods.</p>
      <p>Excavation of new harbors, big dams,&lt;br/&gt;canals created in seconds</p>
      <p>for the tremendous energy of the peaceful atoms.</p>
      <p>- Take nuclear devices and blow at harbors?</p>
      <p>It would be a rather radiation</p>
      <p>tinged harbors, of course.</p>
      <p>- Radioactions used for food preservations&lt;br/&gt;and sterilization.</p>
      <p>- Using radiation to irradiate food</p>
      <p>and so you could eat a potato&lt;br/&gt;in three years or five years.</p>
      <p>If you felt like eating&lt;br/&gt;a four-year-old potato,</p>
      <p>this was just another scheme.</p>
      <p>- Even your toothpaste maybe a product&lt;br/&gt;of the atomic age.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Dr. Ernest Sternglass] Everybody wanted&lt;br/&gt;to do good.</p>
      <p>All the Phoenix community wanted to see&lt;br/&gt;the happy peaceful atom.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- Then there was this big scheme of,&lt;br/&gt;where we could use the heat to boil water</p>
      <p>and generate electricity.</p>
      <p>- Electrical power from the atom.&lt;br/&gt;Today, a bold experiment.</p>
      <p>In future years, a reality for homes&lt;br/&gt;and factories and schools all over the world.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- The engine that drives&lt;br/&gt;in nuclear power plant is the reactor</p>
      <p>for uranium and plutonium atoms split apart.&lt;br/&gt;As they split apart, energy is released.</p>
      <p>That energy is used to in this case,&lt;br/&gt;hit up water.</p>
      <p>The hot water is used to make steam that&lt;br/&gt;sends to a turbine that spends a generator</p>
      <p>that makes the electricity goes out&lt;br/&gt;with the water far and wide.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- The plus side of nuclear power is&lt;br/&gt;there&#8217;s an awful lot of energy</p>
      <p>in a small of material.</p>
      <p>The hundred tons that&#8217;s in the typical reactor core can generate a power</p>
      <p>for millions of homes for two years.</p>
      <p>It is a very enticing technology.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>The ones on those rows is the byproducts.</p>
      <p>When the atoms reactor, a nuclear course&lt;br/&gt;split apart,</p>
      <p>their byproduct are also radioactive.&lt;br/&gt;They generate heat for months to years</p>
      <p>to thousands of years later.</p>
      <p>There&#8217;s a lot of energy that you have&lt;br/&gt;to maintain while the reactor</p>
      <p>President Eisenhower is running&lt;br/&gt;and even after it shutdown</p>
      <p>if you don&#8217;t continue to manage to removed&lt;br/&gt;that heat, that fuel--</p>
      <p>that nuclear cord can overheat&lt;br/&gt;and meltdown and catch on fire</p>
      <p>and it&#8217;s gonna work against you&lt;br/&gt;in disastrous ways.</p>
      <p>The 1986 accident at Chernobyl destroyed&lt;br/&gt;that reactor.</p>
      <p>In 1991, there was a report&lt;br/&gt;on Wall Street Journal that said</p>
      <p>the Soviet Union calculated that&lt;br/&gt;the cleanup cost from the one accident</p>
      <p>exceeded the economic benefits derived&lt;br/&gt;from all other nuclear power reactors</p>
      <p>operating in the Soviet Union--&lt;br/&gt;there were 54 of them.</p>
      <p>The risk reward is so different&lt;br/&gt;in nuclear power</p>
      <p>that one bad day at one facility&lt;br/&gt;can wipe out decades of good days</p>
      <p>at dozens of other facilities.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- Globally, there are around 450 commercial&lt;br/&gt;nuclear reactors in the world.</p>
      <p>And they produce about 16% of&lt;br/&gt;the world&#8217;s electricity needs.</p>
      <p>France gets 80% of their energy from&lt;br/&gt;nuclear reactors and Japan gets about 30%.</p>
      <p>- In the United States, we have more&lt;br/&gt;nuclear plants than any other country.</p>
      <p>There are 104, but as a percent of our power, because we were a larger country,</p>
      <p>we have 20% of our power.</p>
      <p>- Along with that,&lt;br/&gt;there are 16 National Laboratories</p>
      <p>spread across the United States.</p>
      <p>Many of which have their own reactors for&lt;br/&gt;research and there are 19 defense plants.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>The department of energy regulates&lt;br/&gt;the laboratory system</p>
      <p>and their reactors and defense reactors.&lt;br/&gt;The NRC regulates the private sector,</p>
      <p>the commercial reactors.</p>
      <p>[Alarm, man talking on the phone]</p>
      <p>- This is not a technology where you take&lt;br/&gt;for granted that the plants</p>
      <p>is gonna continue to operate safely.</p>
      <p>[Alarm]</p>
      <p>- ... 2200 powers and slowly lower</p>
      <p>- The reactor strip.</p>
      <p>- It something that you have to be,&lt;br/&gt;may constantly vigilant about</p>
      <p>and our inspector plays a key role&lt;br/&gt;on that.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- Our inspectors largely to the public&lt;br/&gt;what they&#8217;re doing goes unobserved.</p>
      <p>They don&#8217;t really know that they&#8217;re out there,&lt;br/&gt;that they&#8217;re doing this kind of work</p>
      <p>on a day-to-day basis.</p>
      <p>- [Paul Cataldo] We&#8217;re here everyday,&lt;br/&gt;verifying that the plants</p>
      <p>were operating safely in compliance&lt;br/&gt;with our regulations.</p>
      <p>- [Michelle Catts] We were independently&lt;br/&gt;assessed how the equipment are working,</p>
      <p>how the operators are performing&lt;br/&gt;and does the plant responding as designed.</p>
      <p>We look at security, we look at how the sites&lt;br/&gt;prepared for flood, earthquake, fire.</p>
      <p>We look at how safe the equipment is,&lt;br/&gt;maintained and tested</p>
      <p>Hence, if we find during any of&lt;br/&gt;our inspections that the plant</p>
      <p>is not meeting one of the NRC rules&lt;br/&gt;and regulations,</p>
      <p>it can range up to several penalties, fines.</p>
      <p>A plant can lose their license to be&lt;br/&gt;required to shut down.</p>
      <p>And we have full capability to identify&lt;br/&gt;some of the... we have to shutdown the plant.</p>
      <p>- We try to learn from every event that occurs.</p>
      <p>After Three Mile Island, they put in place&lt;br/&gt;better trainee for operators,</p>
      <p>better emergency response requirements.</p>
      <p>After 9/11, we put in place a whole series&lt;br/&gt;of security improvements,</p>
      <p>the security barriers,</p>
      <p>the checkpoints that you have to deal with.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>[car running]</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] This is the southern end.</p>
      <p>Yes, just ... in it.&lt;br/&gt;The fucking backdoors are wide open.</p>
      <p>[car running]</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] Again,&lt;br/&gt;this is the southern gate.</p>
      <p>But I think the gate should be closed.&lt;br/&gt;I think you should be _____ here.</p>
      <p>I think rather than put up the welcome mat,&lt;br/&gt;you should be telling the people</p>
      <p>to stay to fuck away.</p>
      <p>There it is. Nobody is in there.&lt;br/&gt;I mean, the guard booth unoccupied.</p>
      <p>- All the plants are required to have&lt;br/&gt;what&#8217;s known as</p>
      <p>a radiological environmental monitoring program&lt;br/&gt;and they were required to do monitoring</p>
      <p>in the area of the plant.</p>
      <p>They have to go out and take samples of&lt;br/&gt;vegetation samples of dairy water samples,</p>
      <p>aquatic samples--all of that</p>
      <p>and report a data back to us</p>
      <p>and then we will run to inspection of&lt;br/&gt;these programs on a regular basis</p>
      <p>to make sure its leaving up&lt;br/&gt;to its requirements.</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] This is interesting.&lt;br/&gt;Every year they have to produce a ramp</p>
      <p>which is like their environmental&lt;br/&gt;monitoring program</p>
      <p>and it looks really impressive&lt;br/&gt;and it&#8217;s glossy and you&#8217;ll go back</p>
      <p>and you&#8217;ll see these are the results&lt;br/&gt;from this stat and the other thing.</p>
      <p>Well, here&#8217;s your terrestrial garden.&lt;br/&gt;You know, where they grab some of their samples.</p>
      <p>They still actually haven&#8217;t replaced&lt;br/&gt;the names here. It&#8217;s kind of dated.</p>
      <p>JP nuclear really not around,&lt;br/&gt;Emergen really doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
      <p>So, it&#8217;s actually Exelon that does&lt;br/&gt;the environmental impact assessment.</p>
      <p>Here you grab samples ... from a plant</p>
      <p>that emits radiation d north.</p>
      <p>So you know, you&#8217;re gonna make up your own mind,&lt;br/&gt;but if you don&#8217;t look, you don&#8217;t find.</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] Now, nuclear power&lt;br/&gt;a lot of times and most of the times</p>
      <p>will stay within this cage,</p>
      <p>but nuclear power by definition is&lt;br/&gt;an uncontrolled reaction</p>
      <p>and when you lose control,&lt;br/&gt;it&#8217;s just like a jailbreak</p>
      <p>and a hell breaks out,&lt;br/&gt;and that a hell of a price to pay.</p>
      <p>- I hate to say this, but there&#8217;s a couple&lt;br/&gt;of things are gonna have to occur</p>
      <p>for things to change probably a bad thing.&lt;br/&gt;You know, it seems that human respond</p>
      <p>to catastrophe in a positive way.</p>
      <p>whether it&#8217;s Three Mile Island,&lt;br/&gt;whether it&#8217;s 9/11, whether it&#8217;s Haiti,</p>
      <p>sometimes you have to be jolted back&lt;br/&gt;to reality.</p>
      <p>[earthquake, things falling down]</p>
      <p>[Chaos, people shouting]</p>
      <p>&#9834; [music] &#9834;</p>
      <p>- It&#8217;s been nearly 24 hours&lt;br/&gt;since the powerful earthquake</p>
      <p>touched off by huge tsunami&lt;br/&gt;that swept across Japan&#8217;s East Coast.</p>
      <p>The quake, a magnitude 8.9 was&lt;br/&gt;the fifth largest in modern history.</p>
      <p>- Nearly, a dozen nuclear power plants&lt;br/&gt;were shut down, including one,</p>
      <p>170 miles Northeast of Tokyo.</p>
      <p>The cooling system failed&lt;br/&gt;when the electricity went out.</p>
      <p>- Tonight the crisis has taken another turn.&lt;br/&gt;We&#8217;re in the middle of covering</p>
      <p>a full blown nuclear scare in Japan.</p>
      <p>There are 17 nuclear power plants&lt;br/&gt;across that nation</p>
      <p>54 separate nuclear reactors,</p>
      <p>one plant in particular though&lt;br/&gt;is in trouble.</p>
      <p>The Fukushima Plant...</p>
      <p>- [Anchorwoman] Japanese authorities&lt;br/&gt;declared a state of emergency</p>
      <p>at that nuclear plant damaged by the quake&lt;br/&gt;as radiation level spiked.</p>
      <p>- [NBC Anchorwoman] Japanese officials say&lt;br/&gt;they have lost control of two reactors.</p>
      <p>The fear is those reactors could be headed&lt;br/&gt;for a meltdown.</p>
      <p>- [Fox Anchorwoman] Hydrogen explosion has&lt;br/&gt;been reported at Japan&#8217;s Fukushima Daiichi lant,</p>
      <p>three people have been hurt,&lt;br/&gt;seven are now missing.</p>
      <p>- [CNN Anchorman] The concern here,&lt;br/&gt;of course, is spread of radiation.</p>
      <p>People were saying what exactly,&lt;br/&gt;what exactly is a meltdown?</p>
      <p>- With the big push lately to restart&lt;br/&gt;our long stalled expansion</p>
      <p>of America&#8217;s nuclear capability,</p>
      <p>this Japanese disaster causing some real&lt;br/&gt;concern and soul searching, should it?</p>
      <p>- March 23rd, it is March 23rd isn&#8217;t it?</p>
      <p>The day&#8217;s are all kind of bonding&lt;br/&gt;the other, right now.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s almost two weeks after the disaster&lt;br/&gt;in Japan.</p>
      <p>The news continues to get worse over there.</p>
      <p>We&#8217;re sitting here in New York&lt;br/&gt;and there are stories coming out</p>
      <p>every time you turn around&lt;br/&gt;about Indian Point</p>
      <p>Could it happen here? What are the risks?</p>
      <p>- Nuclear Power. I don&#8217;t want Indian Point.&lt;br/&gt;I&#8217;ve lived down the street.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s like a cul-de-sac and I&#8217;m just the--&lt;br/&gt;I don&#8217;t want that anymore.</p>
      <p>How can we, how can we get them&lt;br/&gt;to take that away.</p>
      <p>- But governor, we have to know--</p>
      <p>- For 10 years, river keeper has been watching&lt;br/&gt;Indian Point from the standpoint of safety.</p>
      <p>- In fact, even one NRC official said that&lt;br/&gt;if we had the chance to re-license that reactor,</p>
      <p>knowing today, we probably would not&lt;br/&gt;license that reactor.</p>
      <p>-Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s not this--&lt;br/&gt;as the kids say "no brainer"...</p>
      <p>- Before the Japan earthquakes,&lt;br/&gt;people were not paying attention</p>
      <p>to the risks of accident,&lt;br/&gt;risk of radiation releases, now they are.</p>
      <p>- Is Indian Point safe?</p>
      <p>New Yorkers are anxiously asking&lt;br/&gt;that question as Japan reels.</p>
      <p>Tuesday, the nation&#8217;s top nuclear watchdog&lt;br/&gt;gave a qualified answer.</p>
      <p>- We believed with based on all&lt;br/&gt;the information we have now</p>
      <p>that Indian Point continues to meet our&lt;br/&gt;standards and operates safely and securely.</p>
      <p>- The problem is that to some,&lt;br/&gt;the standards aren&#8217;t tough enough</p>
      <p>that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
      <p>The agency has granted Indian Point numerous&lt;br/&gt;exceptions of safety rules at the site</p>
      <p>which sits to stride two faultlines.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- Indian Point was built at a time when we didn&#8217;t understand</p>
      <p>how big the earthquake risk really was.</p>
      <p>They estimated that the worst earthquake&lt;br/&gt;that we would have in this area</p>
      <p>would be a 3.0 quake on a Richter scale.</p>
      <p>The research done by Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;shows that there&#8217;s not one but two fault lines</p>
      <p>that cross about a mile north of Indian Point</p>
      <p>and we learned that we could have&lt;br/&gt;a 7.0 earthquake.</p>
      <p>Now, the people who are in Indian Point say,&lt;br/&gt;&#8220;We can handle a 6.0 earthquake.&#8221;</p>
      <p>So, not only are they running a dangerous plant,&lt;br/&gt;but they can&#8217;t do basic math</p>
      <p>because the 7.0 quake is 30 times&lt;br/&gt;more powerful than a 6.0 earthquake.</p>
      <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission&lt;br/&gt;requires in the United States</p>
      <p>a 10-mile radius evacuation plan.</p>
      <p>- [John Robin] Regulators told American&lt;br/&gt;to state 50 miles away</p>
      <p>from the stricken Japanese Plant,&lt;br/&gt;but the evacuation plan here</p>
      <p>only has a radius of 10 miles.</p>
      <p>- Indian Point is 34 miles north&lt;br/&gt;of Times Squares.</p>
      <p>There&#8217;s 20 million Americans who live&lt;br/&gt;and work within 50 miles of Indian Point-</p>
      <p>you certainly wouldn&#8217;t have a prayer&lt;br/&gt;in an emergency where like Fukushima</p>
      <p>you need to evacuate 50 miles.</p>
      <p>- The plants owners and its opponents&lt;br/&gt;agree on this point</p>
      <p>there is right now no feasible plan&lt;br/&gt;to safely and quickly evacuate</p>
      <p>20 million people from a 50-mile danger zone.</p>
      <p>- [Jim Steets] I would anticipate that&lt;br/&gt;there&#8217;s a situation,</p>
      <p>a reasonable scenario at Indian Point that&lt;br/&gt;whatever, you know, whatever warranted.</p>
      <p>- This is one of the oldest plants&lt;br/&gt;in the country.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s near more people than any other plant&lt;br/&gt;in the country.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s the plant with the greatest earthquake risk</p>
      <p>and it&#8217;s got no viable evacuation &lt;br/&gt;plan.</p>
      <p>Well, guess what, the relicensing hearing&lt;br/&gt;is in the fall of 2011.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- The stakes are really high right now&lt;br/&gt;because so many of these plants</p>
      <p>are coming out or about to come out&lt;br/&gt;for relicensure.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>When they were first built,&lt;br/&gt;they received a license for 40 years.</p>
      <p>If it&#8217;s relicensed, typically for 20 years,</p>
      <p>these reactors then will be 60 years old&lt;br/&gt;and the technology is aging.</p>
      <p>Simply the parts are aging.</p>
      <p>There are reactors where there are leaking&lt;br/&gt;things into the ground and the water.</p>
      <p>&#9834; [music] &#9834;</p>
      <p>- Currently, Indian Point is&lt;br/&gt;in that process of license</p>
      <p>we know there is hearings coming up.&lt;br/&gt;So, that process can work itself out.</p>
      <p>&#9834; [music] &#9834;</p>
      <p>- A license at these plants, it&#8217;s up to&lt;br/&gt;headquarters and the courts</p>
      <p>and the hearing process.</p>
      <p>- So, let&#8217;s look at the licensing process.</p>
      <p>Do they study whether or not the&lt;br/&gt;evacuation plan is still viable?</p>
      <p>Hell, no.</p>
      <p>Are they gonna study the earthquake risks&lt;br/&gt;at Indian Point during this licensing process?</p>
      <p>Hell, no.</p>
      <p>Are they gonna study the fire risks&lt;br/&gt;at Indian Point?</p>
      <p>No. They already decided that that&#8217;s okay.</p>
      <p>&#9834; [music] &#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Robert Alvarez] The Nuclear Regulatory&lt;br/&gt;Commission is under a lot of pressure</p>
      <p>to not push forth safety upgrades that will require additional capital expenses.</p>
      <p>And instead, they&#8217;re being pushed to move&lt;br/&gt;to goal post.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s kind of like, the NFL were to move the goal post at a 50-yard line</p>
      <p>because most of its players were aging&lt;br/&gt;and a lot of them need hip replacements.</p>
      <p>&#9834; [drum playing] &#9834;</p>
      <p>- Every single plant that has applied&lt;br/&gt;to be re-licensed has been accepted.</p>
      <p>Even Vermont Yankee,</p>
      <p>a plant where they had a collapsed at the&lt;br/&gt;cooling tower for God&#8217;s|sake still re-licensed.</p>
      <p>&#9834; [drum playing] &#9834;</p>
      <p>I don&#8217;t think they have a stamp&lt;br/&gt;in their office for license denied.</p>
      <p>Now, in the wake of Fukushima,&lt;br/&gt;they better order that stamp.</p>
      <p>Because so many people are gonna tell&lt;br/&gt;the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
      <p>We demand you consider earthquake risks.</p>
      <p>We demand you consider evacuation issues.&lt;br/&gt;We&#8217;ll close this plant.</p>

      <p>- Yeah, let&#8217;s do noon?</p>
      <p>I&#8217;m expecting some autograph disc&lt;br/&gt;from Bono.</p>
      <p>- So, it&#8217;s you. It&#8217;s Eric Epstein.&lt;br/&gt;I&#8217;m calling from Harrisburg.</p>
      <p>[Laughing]</p>
      <p>- Yeah, I had been a busy man.</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] At one point,&lt;br/&gt;you were saying you have identified</p>
      <p>elevated levels of radiation.</p>
      <p>On the other side, you&#8217;re saying&lt;br/&gt;that you know, no increase levels</p>
      <p>where radiation were found.</p>
      <p>- You can&#8217;t have</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] You know, everybody keeps&lt;br/&gt;talking about the half-life of radiation.</p>
      <p>We should probably start about&lt;br/&gt;the half-life of memory.</p>
      <p>[Laughing]</p>
      <p>Because I mean, I got to tell you,&lt;br/&gt;absolute distractions in Japan</p>
      <p>people are willing to buy the ...</p>
      <p>-[Eric Epstein] I am expecting a news crew&lt;br/&gt;out here.</p>
      <p>I&#8217;m just wondering the estimated time&lt;br/&gt;of arrival because I have another crew</p>
      <p>coming as well and I didn&#8217;t want them&lt;br/&gt;to get into a death match</p>
      <p>for my media profile.</p>
      <p>- All right. Rose, you&#8217;re not in this. Get--hey, hey, go. Go. Go. Go. Okay.</p>
      <p>We&#8217;re taking him to the Chinese buffet.</p>
      <p>- Okay, and today, we&#8217;re at the&lt;br/&gt;32nd anniversary--</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] It was 32 years&lt;br/&gt;since the accident began.</p>
      <p>- In &#8217;79, you didn&#8217;t have the 24/7 news cycle.&lt;br/&gt;I think one of the differences today</p>
      <p>is that there&#8217;s a boat load of information&lt;br/&gt;out there, but also a conflict of facts.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Jack Spencer] They need to get&lt;br/&gt;a power source to ensure</p>
      <p>that they continue flooding&lt;br/&gt;that reactor with water.</p>
      <p>And over a couple of days, it will&lt;br/&gt;cool down and it will be fine.</p>
      <p>- Hmm, okay. Well, Jack Spencer,&lt;br/&gt;we are all crossing our fingers</p>
      <p>that you are right.</p>
      <p>Thanks for joining us.</p>
      <p>- The device to cool the fuel rods&lt;br/&gt;has been dysfunctioned</p>
      <p>and at one point in time, the water level&lt;br/&gt;did start to fall and the fuel rods</p>
      <p>were exposed above the water.</p>
      <p>- Nobody in the Japanese public is being&lt;br/&gt;exposed to doses of radiation</p>
      <p>that would even be close to harmful.</p>
      <p>- Radiation has spread from these reactors&lt;br/&gt;and the level seems very high.</p>
      <p>&#9834; [music] &#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Ann Coulter] Radiation in excess&lt;br/&gt;of what the governments says</p>
      <p>are the minimum amount you should be&lt;br/&gt;exposed to.</p>
      <p>- All right.</p>
      <p>- [Ann Coulter] They&#8217;re actually good for you&lt;br/&gt;and reduce cases of cancer.</p>
      <p>- The column is entitled a glowing report&lt;br/&gt;on radiation.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] Radiation just seems&lt;br/&gt;so abstract.</p>
      <p>For the most part, you can&#8217;t see it,&lt;br/&gt;feel it or taste it.</p>
      <p>So, it adds to what I would call&lt;br/&gt;the maniacal nature of threat.</p>
      <p>I think people more comfortable&lt;br/&gt;with the tactile image, you know,</p>
      <p>with the aura of fire or something&lt;br/&gt;they can see, a flood, earthquake.</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] When you&#8217;re running&lt;br/&gt;from the invisible,</p>
      <p>there&#8217;s a psychological component to them.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s almost, uh, almost a terror&lt;br/&gt;but the fear of the unknown.</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] So, we take the wind&lt;br/&gt;and the density,</p>
      <p>you will find that&#8217;s where we put&lt;br/&gt;our monitors.</p>
      <p>We now have a very sophisticated radiation&lt;br/&gt;monitoring network.</p>
      <p>Our commitment to the community is never,&lt;br/&gt;ever again will you be dependent</p>
      <p>on the government or the industry&lt;br/&gt;for radiation readings.</p>
      <p>We have innovated a new monitor&lt;br/&gt;with a router hooked up to your computer</p>
      <p>so that we could just go and take&lt;br/&gt;the information on a real-time basis.</p>
      <p>You know, the industry and the government&lt;br/&gt;seemed to think this is a settled matter</p>
      <p>and what I&#8217;ve always said and I know&lt;br/&gt;people bristle when I say this,</p>
      <p>radiogenic cancers take decades.</p>
      <p>You know, not all of them but some of them&lt;br/&gt;take decades until they manifest</p>
      <p>and you can document.</p>
      <p>And basically, I think the government,&lt;br/&gt;the industries throwing in the towns</p>
      <p>so that nobody was killed at TMI.</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] I think everybody&lt;br/&gt;in the area knows somebody</p>
      <p>who has had cancer and suspect that&lt;br/&gt;it&#8217;s been linked to TMI.</p>
      <p>When you start talking about nuclear power&lt;br/&gt;and health effects,</p>
      <p>it makes people uncomfortable&lt;br/&gt;and it should because there is an access.</p>
      <p>There is a connection.</p>
      <p>Exposure to radiation is not a good thing.&lt;br/&gt;Every exposure is a potential overexposure--</p>
      <p>that&#8217;s reality.</p>
      <p>You can make any regulation you want.</p>
      <p>You can create any number you want,&lt;br/&gt;but you cannot refute what is known</p>
      <p>and that is getting exposed to radiation&lt;br/&gt;is not healthy.</p>
      <p>I mean, most nuclear power plants leak.&lt;br/&gt;They emit radiation on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>This is a fact of life&lt;br/&gt;but it doesn&#8217;t excite the same kind of</p>
      <p>outrage as other technology.</p>
      <p>You know, nuclear power is more&lt;br/&gt;is of stealth health threat.</p>
      <p>You know, it happens incrementally&lt;br/&gt;and happens slowly and because of that,</p>
      <p>I think it&#8217;s difficult for people&lt;br/&gt;to get their arms around.</p>
      <p>- So, you look at me and not the camera.</p>
      <p>- [Dr. Helen Caldicott] Okay.</p>
      <p>- We won&#8217;t hear my voice on this.</p>
      <p>- [Dr. Helen Caldicott] No. Um-hmm.</p>
      <p>- You can try and incorporate&lt;br/&gt;my question here, okay.</p>
      <p>- [Dr. Helen Caldicott] Okay.</p>
      <p>- Let&#8217;s spill in. We can stop if--</p>
      <p>- [Dr. Helen Caldicott] Let&#8217;s go.</p>
      <p>- Okay. So, what&#8217;s your name&lt;br/&gt;and what do you do?</p>
      <p>- Helen Caldicott. I ran around the world&lt;br/&gt;like a chick without a head.</p>
      <p>&#9834; [music] &#9834;</p>
      <p>- We now have a group of doctors called&lt;br/&gt;physicians for social responsibility.</p>
      <p>We&#8217;re going out, giving grand runs&lt;br/&gt;in Yale, Harvard--allover,</p>
      <p>teaching the medical professional about&lt;br/&gt;the dangers of nuclear power and weapons.</p>
      <p>I spent my life much of it running around&lt;br/&gt;the world worried about radiation...</p>
      <p>People who lived down their in those houses...&lt;br/&gt;are dying of cancer.</p>
      <p>They&#8217;re dying of cancer caused&lt;br/&gt;by that plant.</p>
      <p>- [Dr. Helen Caldicott] No radiation&lt;br/&gt;is safe and a ready background radiation</p>
      <p>produces 20-30% of the cancer&lt;br/&gt;we already see and always has.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>And I&#8217;m a pediatrician, I have to ...oath&lt;br/&gt;to save lives. That&#8217;s my vocation.</p>
      <p>I&#8217;m an outside being a medical nun&lt;br/&gt;and I will keep it going until I drop dead</p>
      <p>I suppose.</p>
      <p>On my tombstone they can write, she tried.</p>
      <p>- [VP Metropolitan Edison Co.]&lt;br/&gt;Yes, the situation is under control</p>
      <p>and yes, we know what we&#8217;re doing</p>
      <p>and shortly that&#8217;s the plant will be...</p>
      <p>- [Conversation on the TV] Are we saying&lt;br/&gt;this is a complete meltdown?</p>
      <p>All these conflicting reports they said&lt;br/&gt;no water in the reactors,</p>
      <p>but now they&#8217;re dropping water&lt;br/&gt;in the reactors.</p>
      <p>I guess, the truth is maybe,&lt;br/&gt;maybe the secretary is right.</p>
      <p>Maybe we don&#8217;t know that you have...</p>
      <p>- Mankind is so incredibly stupid&lt;br/&gt;...incredibly stupid.</p>
      <p>- [Conversation on the TV]&lt;br/&gt;...very serious situation.</p>
      <p>It is growing right more gram by the hour.&lt;br/&gt;I think we have to act accordingly.</p>
      <p>- Building 63 hectares&lt;br/&gt;on a north quake fault, their nuts.</p>
      <p>- [Conversation on the TV]&lt;br/&gt;I think you&#8217;re right.</p>
      <p>I think the biggest problem we have the&lt;br/&gt;American public is our deficit of knowledge.</p>
      <p>- My nickname was almost Henny Penny&lt;br/&gt;because it was Henny Penny that,</p>
      <p>that story my father told me he went&lt;br/&gt;to tell a king the sky was falling down.</p>
      <p>So, guess what,</p>
      <p>I haven&#8217;t done it because they called me Hen&lt;br/&gt;or Henny Penny in my family,</p>
      <p>but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done,&lt;br/&gt;isn&#8217;t that funny?</p>
      <p>- It took me years to get my head around&lt;br/&gt;reams and reds.</p>
      <p>Red is a physical dose of radiation&lt;br/&gt;if you get an x-ray.</p>
      <p>Ream is the absorbed biological dose&lt;br/&gt;of radiation what it does to the cells.</p>
      <p>What people don&#8217;t know is that a single&lt;br/&gt;mutation in a single regulatory gene</p>
      <p>caused by a single alpha particle.</p>
      <p>- There&#8217;s a whole variety of radiation&lt;br/&gt;and it&#8217;s imperative people understand this.</p>
      <p>Their x-rays which will which we&#8217;ve&lt;br/&gt;all been aware of</p>
      <p>and we&#8217;ve all been radiated.</p>
      <p>Never had an unnecessary x-rays.</p>
      <p>I had two CT scans the other day&lt;br/&gt;at the insistence of my doctor daughter.</p>
      <p>[Laughter]</p>
      <p>And I got--I&#8217;ve got 22 reams&lt;br/&gt;which is a massive dose</p>
      <p>and she said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry mom,&lt;br/&gt;you&#8217;re too old now to get the cancer."</p>
      <p>"You&#8217;ll die before you get it,"&lt;br/&gt;which made me feel very much reassured.</p>
      <p>[Laughter]</p>
      <p>Then, there are gamma rays,&lt;br/&gt;which are like x-rays non-particulate</p>
      <p>they go straight through your body.</p>
      <p>They don&#8217;t make your radioactive,&lt;br/&gt;but in the instant, they go through.</p>
      <p>They can mutate a gene.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>Then this alpha radiation,&lt;br/&gt;which is particulate emitted</p>
      <p>from a nonstable out from a gene&lt;br/&gt;atom-like plutonium, like uranium.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>They don&#8217;t affect you if they land&lt;br/&gt;on your skin, but if you inhale them</p>
      <p>or ingest them,</p>
      <p>and they land in various organs,&lt;br/&gt;the surrounding cells that tiny particle</p>
      <p>get a huge dose of radiation.</p>
      <p>Most die, but as radiation decreases&lt;br/&gt;with the square of the disease</p>
      <p>on the periphery of that volume of cells,&lt;br/&gt;the cells remained viable.</p>
      <p>They regulates your genes, become mutated&lt;br/&gt;and the cell years later instead of dividing</p>
      <p>into two in a regulated fashion, makes&lt;br/&gt;trillions of cells and that&#8217;s a cancer.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>Then there are beta particles--&lt;br/&gt;American say beta.</p>
      <p>I say beta and their electrons,&lt;br/&gt;which is smaller than alpha particles</p>
      <p>do the same thing damage genes.</p>
      <p>So, later you may incubate cancer,&lt;br/&gt;some 2 to 60 years later.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Dr. Caldicott] Each dose of radiation&lt;br/&gt;you receive is cumulative.</p>
      <p>It adds to the risk of you getting cancer.&lt;br/&gt;No radiation is safe.</p>
      <p>These isotopes from T9, Tc, cesium 137, radioact dividing, plutonium, tritium.</p>
      <p>Tritium is a really nasty substance,&lt;br/&gt;is radioactive hydrogen.</p>
      <p>It is absorbs through the skin and that is&lt;br/&gt;emitted all the time from reactors.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- You would hear the statement that&lt;br/&gt;no weight level of radiation is safe</p>
      <p>and there&#8217;s radiation in the soil.</p>
      <p>Tree of bananas.&lt;br/&gt;There&#8217;s radiation of bananas.</p>
      <p>You fly to Denver, you&#8217;re gonna get&lt;br/&gt;radiation at very small levels</p>
      <p>the likelihood that you would develop cancer&lt;br/&gt;or some other disease from radiation</p>
      <p>exposure is extremely small.</p>
      <p>It goes up based on the amount&lt;br/&gt;of radiation you&#8217;re exposed to.</p>
      <p>- [Dr. Helen] How can they say in some&lt;br/&gt;occasion exposed people to radiation.</p>
      <p>They know damn well it&#8217;s gonna increase&lt;br/&gt;the incidence of cancer.</p>
      <p>Have they ever seen this person die of cancer?&lt;br/&gt;Do they really know what this is about?</p>
      <p>- [Kelly McMasters] Most people at my age,&lt;br/&gt;don&#8217;t assume that they&#8217;re gonna get cancer</p>
      <p>and that was revolutionary to me that&lt;br/&gt;other people didn&#8217;t live with that fear.</p>
      <p>When I was around 10, when it started&lt;br/&gt;the first inkling that something might be</p>
      <p>wrong there on every block people were&lt;br/&gt;getting sick and sicker.</p>
      <p>Something wasn&#8217;t right.</p>
      <p>- [Randy Snell] I came here to have my family,&lt;br/&gt;live in a country setting, out on the,</p>
      <p>you know,| pristine area of Long Island.</p>
      <p>- Where did it go?</p>
      <p>- When my daughter Lauren was 3-1/2 years old,&lt;br/&gt;we got the result that she has this cancer</p>
      <p>called rhabdomyosarcoma that, you know,&lt;br/&gt;I never heard of.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Randy Snell]As they say in the hospital&lt;br/&gt;you won the unlucky lottery.</p>
      <p>Over the next year, we spent at least two&lt;br/&gt;out of every three weeks in the hospital.</p>
      <p>My daughter went through 11 months&lt;br/&gt;of chemotherapy and six weeks of radiation.</p>
      <p>Her friends were--the kids on the floor&lt;br/&gt;and, you know, from time to time,</p>
      <p>we would lose one of those kids.</p>
      <p>It was hard. It was hard watching kids die&lt;br/&gt;and knowing that you know that,</p>
      <p>you could be the next person in that&lt;br/&gt;situation could be extremely difficult.</p>
      <p>And these kids--we don&#8217;t know what we lost&lt;br/&gt;when we lost them.</p>
      <p>You know, what future they have,&lt;br/&gt;but they never had a future.</p>
      <p>- [Lauren Snell] I have my friends&lt;br/&gt;in my chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>- So you finish your chemotherapy?</p>
      <p>- Uh-hmm.</p>
      <p>- Are you glad to be done with that?</p>
      <p>- Uh-huh.</p>
      <p>- [Randy] I could remember one day saying,&lt;br/&gt;all I wanted to see her do</p>
      <p>is get on the bus and go to kindergarten.</p>
      <p>That&#8217;s how long I was looking&lt;br/&gt;in the future for her.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Lauren]I started to talk to some of the nurses,&lt;br/&gt;asking them about cases of rhabdo.</p>
      <p>I had looked up the figures and it said that&lt;br/&gt;rhabdomyosarcoma only happened</p>
      <p>in one in four million kids a year.</p>
      <p>This was a list of the kids--&lt;br/&gt;this is up to 20.</p>
      <p>There was two kids on one street&lt;br/&gt;who had rhabdomyosarcoma.</p>
      <p>The statistics on that is just improbable.</p>
      <p>If this is so rare, there&#8217;s something&lt;br/&gt;that&#8217;s wrong about this.</p>
      <p>I actually called the doctor, who was&lt;br/&gt;doing an initial study on rhabdomyosarcoma.</p>
      <p>He related the disease to exposure to low level radiation.</p>
      <p>I said, where could she be getting this&lt;br/&gt;from around here?</p>
      <p>[bird chirping]</p>
      <p>- [Kelly McMasters] So right now,&lt;br/&gt;we&#8217;re standing on Carl&#8217;s Industry</p>
      <p>that was nicknamed death row.</p>
      <p>Pretty much almost every house&lt;br/&gt;on the street</p>
      <p>had somebody who is sick with cancer&lt;br/&gt;or something else.</p>
      <p>People started realizing that they weren&#8217;t&lt;br/&gt;the only sick ones.</p>
      <p>Their neighbor is sick as well.</p>
      <p>- [Randy] We would be into people&#8217;s basements&lt;br/&gt;and their kitchens and we talked about</p>
      <p>what we found and you know, we do research&lt;br/&gt;and somebody would find something.</p>
      <p>- [Kelly] All signs seemed to put&lt;br/&gt;to what was beyond this barbwire fence.</p>
      <p>[bird chirping]</p>
      <p>- These are all rhabdomyosarcoma cases.</p>
      <p>Here is my daughter. Shirley here, all the&lt;br/&gt;other cases are all within the confines</p>
      <p>of real close to Brookhaven National&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Randy]I knew there was a laboratory&lt;br/&gt;at Brookhaven</p>
      <p>But I pictured this as a bunch of guys&lt;br/&gt;in white coats with test tubes,</p>
      <p>heating them up and you know,&lt;br/&gt;doing whatever type of experiments.</p>
      <p>- The Brookhaven National Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;conducts sophisticated nuclear experiments</p>
      <p>producing an enormous amount&lt;br/&gt;of deadly waste.</p>
      <p>- [Randy] The only research I had so that&lt;br/&gt;my daughter&#8217;s cancer was caused</p>
      <p>by low level radiation&lt;br/&gt;and Brookhaven National Laboratory</p>
      <p>was the only source of that.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- The lab is said to tap primary underground&lt;br/&gt;water supply from 1.3 million residents</p>
      <p>of New York&#8217;s Long Island.</p>
      <p>- [Robert Casey] It certainly not a risk&lt;br/&gt;to people outside of the lab.</p>
      <p>- [Randy] What was explained to me is that&lt;br/&gt;we&#8217;re the scientific minds out here.</p>
      <p>We know what we&#8217;re doing and you need to&lt;br/&gt;trust us that we wouldn&#8217;t do anything</p>
      <p>to intentionally harm you.</p>
      <p>- [Kelly] I remember this moment when&lt;br/&gt;it started to really snow ball.</p>
      <p>- We recently visited some of the parents&lt;br/&gt;who are dealing with their children in cancer.</p>
      <p>Please welcome, Mr. Randy Snell to the show.</p>
      <p>[applause]</p>
      <p>- [Kelly] Randy seemed to be the one who&lt;br/&gt;most often talked to the press.</p>
      <p>He was a great source of dignity&lt;br/&gt;and his story really hit home for me.</p>
      <p>- How many surgeries did she had&lt;br/&gt;to go through?</p>
      <p>- [Randy] She went through five surgeries.</p>
      <p>- At that point, I decided to join&lt;br/&gt;the group called</p>
      <p>"Standing for Truth About Radiation."</p>
      <p>Now, you know, we had a--&lt;br/&gt;an organized force</p>
      <p>To try to lobby, to bring attention&lt;br/&gt;to what was going on</p>
      <p>and it incorporated to some of the more&lt;br/&gt;powerful people on the east end of the island.</p>
      <p>- [Alec Baldwin] I think that people either&lt;br/&gt;"A" on the most ignorant level</p>
      <p>looked at Brookhaven like any other&lt;br/&gt;national laboratory and thought,</p>
      <p>you know, the wonders of science you know,&lt;br/&gt;which should probably be the name of film</p>
      <p>they showed me when I was in third grade.</p>
      <p>And, and if they don&#8217;t think that&lt;br/&gt;they just think it&#8217;s just gonna be</p>
      <p>too much of a hassle to find out the truth.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Kelly] Over the years and years&lt;br/&gt;of researching this,</p>
      <p>I kept hoping that I would find&lt;br/&gt;a piece of paper that would say,</p>
      <p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re reading everything incorrectly,&#8221;</p>
      <p>or actually responsibility was taken.</p>
      <p>- We did find tritium in the ground water&lt;br/&gt;above the drinking water standard.</p>
      <p>We determined that the extent of the pool&lt;br/&gt;is well within the site boundary</p>
      <p>so no one is drinking the contaminated water.</p>
      <p>- [Kelly] They kept saying, you know,</p>
      <p>on The Montel Williams Show&lt;br/&gt;or in the press releases</p>
      <p>that there was no off-site plume,&lt;br/&gt;but very clearly this states in &#8217;91</p>
      <p>off-site tritium plumes&lt;br/&gt;southern and eastern releases</p>
      <p>a radioactivity from a sewerage&lt;br/&gt;treatment plant.</p>
      <p>The HWMA and the landfills have been&lt;br/&gt;detected an offsite residential wells.</p>
      <p>Offsite residential wells.</p>
      <p>Area of concern 23,&lt;br/&gt;here and here, offsite tritium plume,</p>
      <p>which they say does not exist.</p>
      <p>I will just stress again,&lt;br/&gt;it&#8217;s like I typed up this document.</p>
      <p>This came right out of their library.</p>
      <p>- [Alec] You could have respect for science.</p>
      <p>You could have respect for all the works&lt;br/&gt;that is being done BNL,</p>
      <p>but what you can&#8217;t right off&lt;br/&gt;is they are liars.</p>
      <p>The people who run&lt;br/&gt;Brookhaven National Laboratory</p>
      <p>were filthy, no good, low down,&lt;br/&gt;scam sucking liars.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Randy] Brookhaven Lab had been&lt;br/&gt;leaking for years.</p>
      <p>This is in the water that we&#8217;re drinking.</p>
      <p>I mean</p>
      <p>We are all hooked up to the aqua for here&lt;br/&gt;and the</p>
      <p>Right, you&#8217;re bathing in it,&lt;br/&gt;washing your dishes with it</p>
      <p>I think of my daughter, Lauren.</p>
      <p>We moved in when she was a month old.&lt;br/&gt;To save money, we got the powdered formula.</p>
      <p>What did we mixed the powdered formula with?</p>
      <p>We mixed it with the water from the taps.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Lauren Snell] It&#8217;s so dangerous&lt;br/&gt;texting while walking.</p>
      <p>I just knew I was--&lt;br/&gt;knew I was definitely different.</p>
      <p>I knew, you know, going to the hospital&lt;br/&gt;and having surgeries wasn&#8217;t normal.</p>
      <p>And I couldn&#8217;t dance with this,&lt;br/&gt;the one guy I love in the world.</p>
      <p>- 1 and 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6...</p>
      <p>- [Lauren] I still wonder why is something so...&lt;br/&gt;awful could happen to a person</p>
      <p>at such a young age, you know.</p>
      <p>I didn&#8217;t asked for it when I was young.&lt;br/&gt;I didn&#8217;t smoke.</p>
      <p>I didn&#8217;t--I didn&#8217;t do anything that would&lt;br/&gt;attract cancer and my dad became my hero.</p>
      <p>Although he wasn&#8217;t a doctor, or an oncologist&lt;br/&gt;or radiologist,</p>
      <p>he...he still was able to make a difference&lt;br/&gt;in trying to figure out what was going on.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Randy Snell] All I ever wanted was&lt;br/&gt;for Brookhaven to admit that</p>
      <p>they did something wrong,&lt;br/&gt;which they never have.</p>
      <p>When they decided not to reopen&lt;br/&gt;the High Flux Beam Reactor,</p>
      <p>to me, that was an admission of guilt&lt;br/&gt;that you should not put a nuclear reactor</p>
      <p>on the source of water for&lt;br/&gt;two and a half million of people.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Randy]Sometimes you can&#8217;t ignore&lt;br/&gt;when you get hit in the face</p>
      <p>And that&#8217;s what I felt we were being--</p>
      <p>we were being hit on the face&lt;br/&gt;with all these cancers.</p>
      <p>People call me a crusader, an activist,&lt;br/&gt;I was being a father.</p>
      <p>Somebody tries to hurt your child,&lt;br/&gt;you stand up against them and you protect them.</p>

      <p>- The energy is holding its meeting&lt;br/&gt;with the public at least annually</p>
      <p>where we describe our assessment&lt;br/&gt;of safety performance,</p>
      <p>I didn&#8217;t mean ... for the prior year.&lt;br/&gt;We also had a time...</p>
      <p>- Once a year,&lt;br/&gt;even the Nuclear Regulatory Commission</p>
      <p>has to show up and tell us with&lt;br/&gt;a straight face, &#8221;We&#8217;ve got your back.&#8221;</p>
      <p>I bet that&#8217;s their least favorite day&lt;br/&gt;of the year.</p>
      <p>- Let me tell you I have never seen&lt;br/&gt;a situation in which a regulatory agency</p>
      <p>deserves what it&#8217;s gonna get tonight</p>
      <p>as much as the&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Regulatory Commission deserves it.</p>
      <p>[applause]</p>
      <p>- You know, nuclear power people tend&lt;br/&gt;to feel very passionately about it</p>
      <p>and so that does translate in the kind of&lt;br/&gt;reception we get from the public.</p>
      <p>- There are agents in the back&lt;br/&gt;so if there is an firearm,</p>
      <p>just stand up and make your way&lt;br/&gt;from the north ..., those exits.</p>
      <p>Thank you.</p>
      <p>[chattering]</p>
      <p>- We see the day to day activity.&lt;br/&gt;Certainly, we don&#8217;t make policy.</p>
      <p>But in our small role of inspection,&lt;br/&gt;assessment, event response,</p>
      <p>very critical role,</p>
      <p>so we welcome the opportunity&lt;br/&gt;to have dialogue with members</p>
      <p>of the public because they&#8217;re important&lt;br/&gt;stakeholder as well.</p>
      <p>- And the bottom line for this&lt;br/&gt;assessment meeting is,</p>
      <p>in 2010, energy operated in ... safely&lt;br/&gt;and that&#8217;s all the ...</p>
      <p>[people shouting]</p>
      <p>- ... feeds into these indicators&lt;br/&gt;are provided by energy</p>
      <p>the inspectors verify this information&lt;br/&gt;on every performance indicator.</p>
      <p>In summary, in any point operated&lt;br/&gt;safely of the...</p>
      <p>[people shouting]</p>
      <p>- Hold on for a second.</p>
      <p>If you don&#8217;t allow them to speak,&lt;br/&gt;we won&#8217;t get the opportunity to speak.</p>
      <p>So we need you to respect us&lt;br/&gt;just like we respect you.</p>
      <p>[people shouting]</p>
      <p>- Quiet.</p>
      <p>- If you continue to</p>
      <p>- And in the interest of people&lt;br/&gt;who want to speak,</p>
      <p>we would change our agenda here&lt;br/&gt;[applause]</p>
      <p>and we will hold the next...&lt;br/&gt;to questions and answers.</p>
      <p>- Fukushima, I&#8217;m sure, it means just like this,&lt;br/&gt;where the government told them,</p>
      <p>nuclear power very safe&lt;br/&gt;and we see what happened.</p>
      <p>[applause]</p>
      <p>- You&#8217;ve granted in the section exemption&lt;br/&gt;from the sent fumes rule number two,</p>
      <p>which you know it has crack in it,&lt;br/&gt;you know it&#8217;s leaking tritium</p>
      <p>in to the groundwater and in to the...&lt;br/&gt;but you&#8217;ve exempted the ...</p>
      <p>- I&#8217;m here to remind you that your job&lt;br/&gt;to protect the public, not the interest of</p>
      <p>[cheering and applause]</p>
      <p>- You guys are supposed to have our backs&lt;br/&gt;and if you want to go back</p>
      <p>in... regulator,</p>
      <p>you better wake up tomorrow morning&lt;br/&gt;and find a new gear</p>
      <p>because this will not ...</p>
      <p>[cheering and applause]</p>
      <p>- [Michelle Catts] Anytime the liaison&lt;br/&gt;brings me anything,</p>
      <p>I question "What they do?"&lt;br/&gt;"Is this the right to do?"</p>
      <p>"Is this the safe thing to do?"</p>
      <p>Is this, you know, piece of equipment&lt;br/&gt;gonna work if you consider size</p>
      <p>and make eventual leaks or--</p>
      <p>we are always questioning everything they do&lt;br/&gt;and I really wish that they could see</p>
      <p>what we do on a day-to-day basis.</p>
      <p>How important it is for us to keep&lt;br/&gt;this plant safe</p>
      <p>and I live eight miles in the plant&lt;br/&gt;with my family.</p>
      <p>You know, it&#8217;s very important to us too.</p>
      <p>- [Eric Epstein] If you like in the NRC&lt;br/&gt;to the local cop on the block</p>
      <p>and everybody liked the local cop&lt;br/&gt;on the block</p>
      <p>and most NRC people I know I like.</p>
      <p>But they can only be as effective,&lt;br/&gt;and aggressive as the mayor lets them</p>
      <p>and in this case, the mayor is the senate.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Neil Sheehan] The congress is very involved.&lt;br/&gt;They wanna know what kind of inspections</p>
      <p>we&#8217;re carrying out to make sure&lt;br/&gt;this plant is safely operated.</p>
      <p>So, they have a very keen interest&lt;br/&gt;in making sure that we&#8217;re living</p>
      <p>to our responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Then, congress decides on annual basis,&lt;br/&gt;how much money we&#8217;re actually gonna get</p>
      <p>and congress is going to decide&lt;br/&gt;what our key priorities are going to be as well.</p>
      <p>- [Peter Bradford] What you have is&lt;br/&gt;the process in which the nuclear industry</p>
      <p>gives a lot of money to congress&lt;br/&gt;and spends a lot more than that on lobbying</p>
      <p>and that results in a lot of pressure&lt;br/&gt;on the commission.</p>
      <p>- [Arnie Gunderson] The only thing you can do&lt;br/&gt;is hold the regulator responsible.</p>
      <p>And the problem is that the regulators&lt;br/&gt;responsible for congress</p>
      <p>and congress is being run by lobbyist.</p>
      <p>- The Nuclear Energy Institute&lt;br/&gt;is the mouthpiece for the industry.</p>
      <p>Now, they&#8217;re very good at what they do.&lt;br/&gt;They just don&#8217;t spend money,</p>
      <p>they spend money in a smart way&lt;br/&gt;and they get tangible results.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>The nuclear power industry&lt;br/&gt;is the best example of how money</p>
      <p>and power intersect to impact policy.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Robert Alvarez] These agencies--&lt;br/&gt;the Energy Department,</p>
      <p>the Regulatory Commission are riddled&lt;br/&gt;with a lot of conscientious, smart,</p>
      <p>well-meaning people who are in a system&lt;br/&gt;that if you do go outside of the boundaries</p>
      <p>of what they considered good form behavior,&lt;br/&gt;you&#8217;re on a career path nowhere.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- In late 1990&#8217;s, there was a whistle blower&lt;br/&gt;who had basically found and reported</p>
      <p>that the owner of the Millstone 1 reactor&lt;br/&gt;had been engaging a very dangerous practice</p>
      <p>of pulling out it&#8217;s spent fuel&lt;br/&gt;from the reactor before it should.</p>
      <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission</p>
      <p>did what you call "wire brush inspection"&lt;br/&gt;and ordered them to shut down.</p>
      <p>This really angered a lot of&lt;br/&gt;Republican members of Congress</p>
      <p>that a regulator would come in&lt;br/&gt;and do something like this.</p>
      <p>And the one member of congress&lt;br/&gt;who was particularly outrage,</p>
      <p>who was in a position to do&lt;br/&gt;something about this</p>
      <p>was Senator Pete Domenici.</p>
      <p>- [Pete] I came from a state within New Mexico&lt;br/&gt;and you see out there people</p>
      <p>some people thinks it&#8217;s a desert.</p>
      <p>Besides that, it has two giant laboratories.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- They got indoctrinated nuclear power&lt;br/&gt;which put me into the probably</p>
      <p>most committed senator to bring back in&lt;br/&gt;the nuclear power</p>
      <p>and to bring it back like why&lt;br/&gt;the Eisenhower spoke of it</p>
      <p>when it was first done.</p>
      <p>- He led the effort to introduce legislation&lt;br/&gt;that would cut 700 people</p>
      <p>from the payroll of the inspection program&lt;br/&gt;in Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Andie Gunderson] Pete Domenici wrote&lt;br/&gt;a book and he actually laughs</p>
      <p>about bidding off on the NRC&lt;br/&gt;and he said he has threatened their budget.</p>
      <p>- [Peter Bradford] He had to come to Jesus&lt;br/&gt;being with the chair</p>
      <p>and Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
      <p>From that point on the NRC became&lt;br/&gt;an enabler rather than a regulator.</p>
      <p>- [Shirley Ann Jackson] In recent months&lt;br/&gt;as many of you have stated that NRC</p>
      <p>has been the subject of&lt;br/&gt;a number of external reviews.</p>
      <p>Some of them sharply critical from our&lt;br/&gt;congressional appropriations committees.</p>
      <p>Most NRC observers are call in for&lt;br/&gt;a more rapid move</p>
      <p>to a regulatory framework with licensee&lt;br/&gt;afforded more flexibility</p>
      <p>in meeting more requirements.</p>
      <p>- So, you had a prominent senator&lt;br/&gt;with over site capacity</p>
      <p>who have the ability to take away&lt;br/&gt;aggressor regulation</p>
      <p>and did the NRC essentially&lt;br/&gt;has become a pussy cat.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s really a toothless regulator.&lt;br/&gt;It has no bite.</p>
      <p>- [Shirley] In fact, we have invited&lt;br/&gt;the nuclear energy institute,</p>
      <p>NEI to submit to the commission&lt;br/&gt;a petition for rule making outlining areas</p>
      <p>where it feels NRC regulations&lt;br/&gt;are duplicative,</p>
      <p>unnecessary in light of other rules&lt;br/&gt;or not sufficiently risk in form.</p>
      <p>- When you think of NRC, you&#8217;re thinking&lt;br/&gt;you know, probably about</p>
      <p>an aggressive regulatory protocol where&lt;br/&gt;the industry is accountable to the NRC.</p>
      <p>This is upside down. The NRC is made&lt;br/&gt;to be accountable to the industry.</p>
      <p>[wind blowing]</p>
      <p>- [Joe Cosgrove] The village ...&lt;br/&gt;right adjacent to Braidwood Nuclear Plant.</p>
      <p>It was always a joke, you know,&lt;br/&gt;you live next when you get a plant</p>
      <p>as everything close, it gonna blow up.</p>
      <p>I used to look at that&lt;br/&gt;as kind of a chicken little syndrome.</p>
      <p>I mean, that was irrational, because&lt;br/&gt;I thought all the safeguards were in place.</p>
      <p>You see water going in, water going out.&lt;br/&gt;I never had any concern for it</p>
      <p>because of my assumption were that&lt;br/&gt;it was so heavily regulated.</p>
      <p>- [Kim Cole] I would sit outside&lt;br/&gt;and I would listen to the hum</p>
      <p>and it would be soothing to me.</p>
      <p>And I would just sit outside like&lt;br/&gt;in the middle of the night</p>
      <p>and I would listen to the hum of that&lt;br/&gt;and be comforted by it.</p>
      <p>I thought that was a good thing.</p>
      <p>Since then and my knowledge of it,&lt;br/&gt;I don&#8217;t find them comforting at all anymore.</p>
      <p>I find them the biggest and hugest enemy.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Joe Cosgrove] I was gonna ask about&lt;br/&gt;the socio-economic area</p>
      <p>and trying to be nice to pretty&lt;br/&gt;poor community.</p>
      <p>I just always believed with water&lt;br/&gt;and people--</p>
      <p>It doesn&#8217;t really matter how much&lt;br/&gt;is in your wallet</p>
      <p>or in your bank to get the same right&lt;br/&gt;to clean and safe drinking water.</p>
      <p>- [Joe Cosgrove] When people called me&lt;br/&gt;and asked me</p>
      <p>"Is it safe to drink our water?"&lt;br/&gt;I couldn&#8217;t answer that.</p>
      <p>I&#8217;m a Park District Director.</p>
      <p>We went to the&lt;br/&gt;Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
      <p>They didn&#8217;t have the authority to go&lt;br/&gt;on station property</p>
      <p>that was the NRC, which is we need to find&lt;br/&gt;the answers of what could possibly get out</p>
      <p>to harm people.</p>
      <p>So, we started testing.</p>
      <p>-[Joe Cosgrove] When you talked about&lt;br/&gt;an old shit moment,</p>
      <p>I think I&#8217;ll be using a file that I have&lt;br/&gt;called "Pioneer Environment Tritium" file</p>
      <p>October 31 to 2002, shell a well number&lt;br/&gt;two 496 picocuries tritium per liter.</p>
      <p>This was a ground water well similar&lt;br/&gt;to what another 260 people</p>
      <p>in this community were drinking from.</p>
      <p>That was my first inclination that&lt;br/&gt;there could be an issue with radionuclides</p>
      <p>with the plant.</p>
      <p>Then, I found on the other side of the plant,&lt;br/&gt;there are 200,000 picocuries per liter.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Mick Scheck] Right there you could see&lt;br/&gt;the plant, great view, falling the trees,</p>
      <p>could grow taller.</p>
      <p>- First, I learned about tritium&lt;br/&gt;in the nuclear leaks and stuff like that</p>
      <p>was basically in the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Exelon stood with conviction from day one&lt;br/&gt;that you have nothing to worry about,</p>
      <p>blah, blah, blah.</p>
      <p>- [Thomas O&#8217;Neill] The tritium amounts&lt;br/&gt;that are in the ground</p>
      <p>are of such concentration that they are low&lt;br/&gt;and they are not a health hazard to you.</p>
      <p>This tritium is not in the drinking water&lt;br/&gt;except for one well.</p>
      <p>- [Mick] Exelon started buying our properties.&lt;br/&gt;They bought up a few and it didn&#8217;t take</p>
      <p>them very long and all to the bulldozer&lt;br/&gt;down the ground.</p>
      <p>There was a scary thought it&#8217;s so safe&lt;br/&gt;and great,</p>
      <p>why you bulldozing the perfectly&lt;br/&gt;good house.</p>
      <p>My gut instinct at that point was, oh, shit,&lt;br/&gt;you know, what have they really done to us.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Shirley Cavanaugh] This again is&lt;br/&gt;the Kankakee River</p>
      <p>and this is the discharge mine.</p>
      <p>This is going over to&lt;br/&gt;the Braidwood Nuclear Station.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- Irene and I were talking and one of&lt;br/&gt;my neighbors have recently passed away</p>
      <p>and then when I was telling her about&lt;br/&gt;all my neighbors,</p>
      <p>she started telling me about all her neighbors&lt;br/&gt;and we&#8217;re only a mile and a half apart.</p>
      <p>- [Shirley Cavanaugh] This were all&lt;br/&gt;the cancers are,</p>
      <p>there is ... or there is ...,</p>
      <p>there is Cavanugh, there is Jennings,&lt;br/&gt;Trembi, Delrose, Cunning, and Bruckman,</p>
      <p>all in a row--</p>
      <p>everyone of these homes without missing&lt;br/&gt;a house had cancer.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- This is absolutely no coincidence.&lt;br/&gt;It just that go cancer, cancer, cancer.</p>
      <p>This is not a conincidence.&lt;br/&gt;Something is wrong, definitely wrong.</p>
      <p>- [Shirley] Both of them died of cancer&lt;br/&gt;and actually there&#8217;s more right behind them.</p>
      <p>There&#8217;s a driveway that goes back here,&lt;br/&gt;the lady dying...</p>
      <p>- We honestly thought that&lt;br/&gt;our Health Department and the NRC</p>
      <p>and places like that were looking out for us,&lt;br/&gt;but we&#8217;ve also found out that the NRC</p>
      <p>and Exelon are working together&lt;br/&gt;and that&#8217;s their job to convince us</p>
      <p>that everything they&#8217;re doing&lt;br/&gt;is perfectly safe.</p>
      <p>- [Steven Orth] Good evening,&lt;br/&gt;my name is Steven Orth</p>
      <p>and I am the representative from the&lt;br/&gt;United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
      <p>- [Joe Cosgrove] Public meetings we held&lt;br/&gt;was a chance for people to ask</p>
      <p>the people that really are charge&lt;br/&gt;with their protection, questions.</p>
      <p>- [Mick] It was not a good vibe in there&lt;br/&gt;for them at that point</p>
      <p>and I always felt the same way.</p>
      <p>The NRC, they supposed to be there&lt;br/&gt;overseeing these guys to protect us.</p>
      <p>- NRC requirements allow licenses&lt;br/&gt;including nuclear power plants</p>
      <p>to release radioactivity into&lt;br/&gt;the environment.</p>
      <p>We require that the releases be controlled&lt;br/&gt;and monitored</p>
      <p>and that the resulting radiation doses&lt;br/&gt;be below the limits that we&#8217;ve established.</p>
      <p>- [Joe Cosgrove] I was never aware that&lt;br/&gt;they were allowed</p>
      <p>or permitted to discharge radioactive fluid.</p>
      <p>If you would have asked anybody&lt;br/&gt;in this area 10 years ago,</p>
      <p>they would have laugh at you, say,&lt;br/&gt;"No, there is some government agencies"</p>
      <p>"and state agencies to protect us.&lt;br/&gt;They would never let that to happen."</p>
      <p>- [Mick] When we looked more into it,&lt;br/&gt;we found that their hands were actually</p>
      <p>basically tied from being able to do&lt;br/&gt;anything other than sit down</p>
      <p>read reports that say everything&lt;br/&gt;is safe and great.</p>
      <p>- Why is it Exelon doing the testing&lt;br/&gt;of these wells</p>
      <p>and why isn&#8217;t there an independent company&lt;br/&gt;doing the testing?</p>
      <p>- The licensee is primarily responsible&lt;br/&gt;for operation at its facility</p>
      <p>and for identifying and analyzing&lt;br/&gt;what occurs at their facility.</p>
      <p>- [Mick] Our opinion of the NRC that&lt;br/&gt;they sit at their desk,</p>
      <p>Exelon goes out and does all these tests</p>
      <p>and stuff like that and they write up&lt;br/&gt;their paperwork and they bring it back</p>
      <p>and they are like,&lt;br/&gt;"Look we got an A+ on their report."</p>
      <p>Guys, look at it and look it all falls&lt;br/&gt;well within the guidelines and stuff.</p>
      <p>File that back to the drawer,&lt;br/&gt;&#8220;Where are you taking me to lunch today?&#8221;</p>
      <p>- We can assure you that the contamination&lt;br/&gt;although locations are not originally intended</p>
      <p>does not present hazard to public health&lt;br/&gt;and safety.</p>
      <p>- We wanted them to say, &#8220;Hey,&lt;br/&gt;you know what? We&#8217;re gonna help you now.&#8221;</p>
      <p>They didn&#8217;t do that.</p>
      <p>They consistently told us&lt;br/&gt;the water is safe to drink.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- We found out that the leaks actually&lt;br/&gt;happened as far back as 10 years prior.</p>
      <p>- [Mick] They say there were 250,000 gallons&lt;br/&gt;in &#8217;96 that leaked at one of the vacuum brakers.</p>
      <p>In &#8217;98 was a six million gallons&lt;br/&gt;and in 2000 was like three million gallons</p>
      <p>according to them.</p>
      <p>- We were knowledgeable of the 2000 leak.&lt;br/&gt;The 2000 leak was reported by the licensee</p>
      <p>in their annual radiological release report&lt;br/&gt;which is public document available</p>
      <p>to anybody in this room,&lt;br/&gt;available to anybody on this panel.</p>
      <p>- You&#8217;re telling me that the US NRC&lt;br/&gt;knew of the 2000 tritium leak in 200?</p>
      <p>Is that what you said?</p>
      <p>- I&#8217;m telling--I&#8217;m explaining that|that leak is a matter of public record.</p>
      <p>- It&#8217;s a matter of public record because&lt;br/&gt;I&#8217;m going to the US NRC representative</p>
      <p>that I have a letter from who told me&lt;br/&gt;that they have no knowledge.</p>
      <p>And so I wanted to make sure&lt;br/&gt;I can quote you tonight</p>
      <p>that you state that you were aware&lt;br/&gt;of the 2000.</p>
      <p>[cheering and applause]</p>
      <p>- [Kim Cole] One of the issues of tritium water.&lt;br/&gt;Like I say, you can&#8217;t smell it,</p>
      <p>no can&#8217;t see it, you can&#8217;t feel it,&lt;br/&gt;but it is absorbed--our water is not safe.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- We&#8217;re not third world.</p>
      <p>We are America and we should be able&lt;br/&gt;to turn our water faucet</p>
      <p>and that you&#8217;ve got safe drinking water.</p>
      <p>We have to get in our vehicles&lt;br/&gt;whether we&#8217;re young, old, disabled,</p>
      <p>and we have to go and get water, filled&lt;br/&gt;in jags and I should not have to do that.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Mick] We wanna, you know,&lt;br/&gt;just one move away from this, you know,</p>
      <p>and we never really kind of get&lt;br/&gt;that opportunity to do.</p>
      <p>We&#8217;ve almost been held here&lt;br/&gt;as nuclear hostages</p>
      <p>because it basically tells you,&lt;br/&gt;no, you&#8217;re not affected</p>
      <p>and we&#8217;re not gonna be buying&lt;br/&gt;your properties.</p>
      <p>I&#8217;m afraid it just looks like ...&lt;br/&gt;you know and you&#8217;re just, you know,</p>
      <p>you&#8217;re collateral damage, and it&lt;br/&gt;kind of sucks to be the collateral damage.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- The NRC&#8217;s regulations had been&lt;br/&gt;on the books for decades</p>
      <p>saying that you&#8217;re not allowed to have&lt;br/&gt;a drop of treated water,</p>
      <p>leave a plant except via controlled&lt;br/&gt;and monitored pathway.</p>
      <p>Not a drop, yet they found&lt;br/&gt;millions of gallons</p>
      <p>that leaked out from plants&lt;br/&gt;and haven&#8217;t find anybody in ...</p>
      <p>- We try to put things in context&lt;br/&gt;in terms of the risk significance.</p>
      <p>Tritium is a weak beta matter that&lt;br/&gt;generally, it will pass through</p>
      <p>the body, pretty regularly.</p>
      <p>We also always talk about the fact that&lt;br/&gt;this tritium will dilute to obviously</p>
      <p>to get in the nearby river or I mean,&lt;br/&gt;the delusion factor will come into play as well.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Joe Cosgrove] When you get up&lt;br/&gt;in the morning,</p>
      <p>you have to drink a water,&lt;br/&gt;brush your teeth.</p>
      <p>You make an assumption that&lt;br/&gt;everything is fine.</p>
      <p>Somebody is taking care of that water&lt;br/&gt;Somebody&#8217;s testing it,</p>
      <p>it&#8217;s safe for me, it&#8217;s healthy,&lt;br/&gt;until you start finding out things.</p>
      <p>Things that terms stakeholders&lt;br/&gt;who are stakeholders</p>
      <p>You know all people,&lt;br/&gt;we are the primary stakeholders,</p>
      <p>you know, we&#8217;re not in this for profit,&lt;br/&gt;we&#8217;re just here to live.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Alec] Nuclear is clean energy.&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear it&#8217;s clean energy.</p>
      <p>Clean burning nuclear power&lt;br/&gt;and you&#8217;re like,</p>
      <p>"what the fuck are you talking about?"</p>
      <p>Nuclear power is too, too,</p>
      <p>Do they make the nuclear rods come off&lt;br/&gt;the nuclear rod tree?</p>
      <p>We go pick them from the nuclear rod orchard?</p>
      <p>- [Kelly] Ultimately, this nuclear story&lt;br/&gt;comes down to waste.</p>
      <p>Even if something works perfectly&lt;br/&gt;and there are no leaks, no spills,</p>
      <p>no accidents, we&#8217;re creating multitude&lt;br/&gt;efficient products--</p>
      <p>strontium, tritium, cesium and all of these&lt;br/&gt;have a profound effect on the human body.</p>
      <p>A lot of these efficient products have&lt;br/&gt;half-lives from 10 years to--</p>
      <p>plutonium has half-life of 24,000 years,</p>
      <p>however half-life is different than when&lt;br/&gt;it is no longer dangerous to human interaction.</p>
      <p>When you take that into consideration,&lt;br/&gt;it turns into 240,000 years.</p>
      <p>- It has been estimated that&lt;br/&gt;by the end of this century,</p>
      <p>one-fourth of the country&#8217;s energy output&lt;br/&gt;could be derived from nuclear power.</p>
      <p>Before that could happened, some way must&lt;br/&gt;be found to get rid</p>
      <p>of deadly radioactive residue forever.</p>
      <p>- Let me put it to you this way,&lt;br/&gt;would you buy a house from a developers</p>
      <p>who said I&#8217;m gonna put a toilet in,&lt;br/&gt;but there&#8217;ll be no septic system for 30 years</p>
      <p>and we&#8217;re just gonna let the human tarps&lt;br/&gt;pile up in the front yard for 30 years.</p>
      <p>Alright, the nuclear tarps&lt;br/&gt;have been piling up in the front yard</p>
      <p>for 30-40 years.</p>
      <p>Nobody I know wants to live next to&lt;br/&gt;a high level radioactive waste site.</p>
      <p>We didn&#8217;t sign up for that. We signed up&lt;br/&gt;to the near nuclear power plant.</p>
      <p>- Here, in Idaho for example, barrels of&lt;br/&gt;radioactive waste are merely covered up</p>
      <p>with dirt, while the nearby nuclear reactor&lt;br/&gt;continues to churn out still more waste.</p>
      <p>- [J. Samuel Walker] A waste was an issue&lt;br/&gt;from an early stage of the Manhattan project.</p>
      <p>But at that point, of course, doing the&lt;br/&gt;Manhattan project,</p>
      <p>the focus was almost exclusively&lt;br/&gt;on building a bomb</p>
      <p>and waste was a problem for later.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>The commercial nuclear power industry&lt;br/&gt;boomed in the late 1960&#8217;s</p>
      <p>to everyone&#8217;s surprised.</p>
      <p>- Scientists estimates that within&lt;br/&gt;the next 10 years,</p>
      <p>nuclear power plants will be turning out&lt;br/&gt;a railroad powerful of radioactive waste</p>
      <p>every 24 hours.</p>
      <p>- The atomic energy commission suddenly fell&lt;br/&gt;under a great deal of pressure to find</p>
      <p>a site for a high level waste&lt;br/&gt;from power reactors.</p>
      <p>- The atomic energy commission wants to buy&lt;br/&gt;2000 acres of land near Lyons, Kansas,</p>
      <p>were used as an atomic waste&lt;br/&gt;dumping ground.</p>
      <p>- The favored solution at that time&lt;br/&gt;goes salt.</p>
      <p>- Scientists believed the vast deposit&lt;br/&gt;of salt out here will make</p>
      <p>an ideal container&lt;br/&gt;for radioactive materials.</p>
      <p>- You put the waste on salt deposit&lt;br/&gt;the salt kind of envelops the waste</p>
      <p>and then it&#8217;s safe.</p>
      <p>So that was a theory of that point.</p>
      <p>- The AEC conducted its own&lt;br/&gt;environmental impacts study</p>
      <p>and concluded that yeah,&lt;br/&gt;Lyons looks pretty good.</p>
      <p>- After several years of research,&lt;br/&gt;the AEC ...the plan was safe.</p>
      <p>After radioactive waste could be&lt;br/&gt;permanently sealed and buried.</p>
      <p>- Unfortunately, Lyons, Kansas,&lt;br/&gt;to turned out not to be the place.</p>
      <p>While Lyons residence didn&#8217;t object&lt;br/&gt;to the project,</p>
      <p>scientists at the University of Kansas did.</p>
      <p>They were not convinced block formation&lt;br/&gt;above the salt mine,</p>
      <p>where the nuclear waste was to be buried&lt;br/&gt;could withstand the extreme heat generated</p>
      <p>by the radioactive materials.</p>
      <p>And in the end, the site turned out&lt;br/&gt;to be extremely unsuitable</p>
      <p>and it was the rocket science&lt;br/&gt;who figures it out.</p>
      <p>The AEC could have known about that,&lt;br/&gt;should have known about it</p>
      <p>and simply didn&#8217;t know its homework.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
      <p>The advent of nuclear technology&lt;br/&gt;has created another problem</p>
      <p>what to do with the tons and tons&lt;br/&gt;of radioactive waste.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>Congress has ordered the Department of Energy&lt;br/&gt;to find a stable underground location</p>
      <p>to isolate the waste from everything&lt;br/&gt;and everybody for 10,000 years.</p>
      <p>Finally, in 1982 congress, said, well,&lt;br/&gt;we have to find a solution to this problem,</p>
      <p>so here what is it.</p>
      <p>DOE is going to investigate sites&lt;br/&gt;and find three other suitable</p>
      <p>and recommend those to president.</p>
      <p>There&#8217;s all kinds of public opposition&lt;br/&gt;and the area surrounding these three sites.</p>
      <p>No, state wants to take nuclear waste&lt;br/&gt;that stage radioactive for thousands of years.</p>
      <p>And therefore, the process is not working&lt;br/&gt;and so we&#8217;re going to designate a single site</p>
      <p>and that that site, of course,&lt;br/&gt;is Yucca Mountain.</p>
      <p>Scientists are gambling that Yucca Mountain,&lt;br/&gt;an hour and a half drive northwest of Las Vegas</p>
      <p>is the perfect spot to store the nuclear waste&lt;br/&gt;because of its remote desert location.</p>
      <p>If you talk to the Nevada people,&lt;br/&gt;they will say screw Nevada Bill,</p>
      <p>they didn&#8217;t have the clout to stop the&lt;br/&gt;site in their state from being designated.</p>
      <p>- Nevada Senator, Harry Reid,&lt;br/&gt;says Yucca Mountain isn&#8217;t about science,</p>
      <p>it&#8217;s about money.</p>
      <p>- [Sen. Harry Reid] This is all&lt;br/&gt;a brainwashed job</p>
      <p>from a very powerful industry.</p>
      <p>The nuclear power industry is as good&lt;br/&gt;at throwing money around</p>
      <p>as anyone I&#8217;ve ever seen.&lt;br/&gt;In fact, I think they&#8217;re better.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- The US government moved closer today&lt;br/&gt;to make the Yucca Mountain in Nevada</p>
      <p>be the underground storage site&lt;br/&gt;for this country&#8217;s nuclear waste.</p>
      <p>As expected, the president Bush today&lt;br/&gt;approved the Yucca site.</p>
      <p>- With the president and congress on board,&lt;br/&gt;billions of dollars already in the underground</p>
      <p>using Yucca Mountain to store nuclear waste&lt;br/&gt;might seem like a foregoing conclusion.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>&#9834;[piano playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- The Obama Administration has been clear&lt;br/&gt;that storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain</p>
      <p>is off the table.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old project seen its budget&lt;br/&gt;slashed by congress in the past several years.</p>
      <p>- [J.S. Walker] As I understand that&lt;br/&gt;President Obama</p>
      <p>instructed Secretary of Energy to withdraw it.</p>
      <p>- Energy secretary Steven Chu said that&lt;br/&gt;scientists have learned more about</p>
      <p>the repository, making it less of an ideal&lt;br/&gt;option to destroy the country&#8217;s nuclear waste.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Robert Gibbs] Taking Yucca Mountain off&lt;br/&gt;the table, in terms of a long-term solution</p>
      <p>for a repository for a nuclear waste,&lt;br/&gt;is the science.</p>
      <p>The science...</p>
      <p>- [J. S. Walker] There are concerns about&lt;br/&gt;theological issues,</p>
      <p>especially seismic issues&lt;br/&gt;and for Senator Reid,</p>
      <p>this is a strong opponent of Yucca Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;So, I think that&#8217;s the main reason.</p>
      <p>- And have the President ... out of his budget,</p>
      <p>It is a dream come true for so many&lt;br/&gt;thousands of thousands people in Nevada.</p>
      <p>- Now, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&lt;br/&gt;must decide if it wants to restart</p>
      <p>what is already a 25-year, $14-billion project.</p>
      <p>A former staff of Senator Reid,&lt;br/&gt;Greg Jaczko, now chairs the NRC.</p>
      <p>- [Gregory Jaczko] It was&lt;br/&gt;a difficult decision,</p>
      <p>and because it is such&lt;br/&gt;a controversial program,</p>
      <p>but again, it was one that was made&lt;br/&gt;and I believe in the best interest of the agency.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- Until the court cases are resolved,&lt;br/&gt;or until something else happens,</p>
      <p>there&#8217;s no progress at all.</p>
      <p>- The waste now is on site at the hundred&lt;br/&gt;and so nuclear power plants</p>
      <p>that are generating power in this country.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[drum playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- I think that America now has a future&lt;br/&gt;for more nuclear power creation.</p>
      <p>I have no problem with that,&lt;br/&gt;as long as the ... is created.</p>
      <p>That is a power.</p>
      <p>If it is safe for 100 years&lt;br/&gt;and by then, they will have some way</p>
      <p>of taking care of it permanently.</p>
      <p>- The Japanese government has released&lt;br/&gt;a bleak picture of the fall out</p>
      <p>from the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Plant.</p>
      <p>The new survey measures levels&lt;br/&gt;of radioactive cesium 137</p>
      <p>is soiled near damage the facility&lt;br/&gt;and it shows the spread</p>
      <p>and seriousness of the contamination.</p>
      <p>- The survey confirms the appalling&lt;br/&gt;magnitude of the contamination.</p>
      <p>I was hoping I&#8217;d be able to return someday&lt;br/&gt;to spend my last years in my hometown,</p>
      <p>but the maps suggest even that&lt;br/&gt;won&#8217;t be possible.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- Japanese prime minister Naoto Kan says,&lt;br/&gt;Japan needs to review its nuclear policies.</p>
      <p>He aims for the country to become a leader&lt;br/&gt;in new energy sources after the nuclear crisis</p>
      <p>at the Fukushima Daiichi Plant.</p>
      <p>- Germany&#8217;s government agreed this morning&lt;br/&gt;to phase out all of its nuclear power plants</p>
      <p>by the year 2022.</p>
      <p>It&#8217;s the first major power to become&lt;br/&gt;nuclear-free since the disaster in Japan.</p>
      <p>- Celebration in Rome&lt;br/&gt;is antinuclear protesters marched</p>
      <p>a big win, an ends to the country&#8217;s&lt;br/&gt;nuclear program.</p>
      <p>As you can see, in the square behind me&lt;br/&gt;people behind me are celebrating</p>
      <p>a resounding defeat to ...&lt;br/&gt;who just two years ago,</p>
      <p>was saying that nuclear power&lt;br/&gt;was the future for Italy.</p>
      <p>Clearly, what happened in Japan&lt;br/&gt;has encouraged people to say</p>
      <p>that they didn&#8217;t want nuclear power here</p>
      <p>and that is why there was such a massive&lt;br/&gt;revolt against what was told 95% of that.</p>
      <p>- [Kelly] I really thought about within&lt;br/&gt;a week after Fukushima,</p>
      <p>okay nuclear renaissance off the table.</p>
      <p>- In light of what&#8217;s happened in Japan,&lt;br/&gt;I would like to hear what you believe</p>
      <p>President Obama&#8217;s position is now&lt;br/&gt;on nuclear power,</p>
      <p>generally in the United States.</p>
      <p>Does he still support a rebirth of nuclear&lt;br/&gt;power and construction of new plants?</p>
      <p>Could you just give us your best estimate&lt;br/&gt;of what his position is?</p>
      <p>- The present budget is what it is&lt;br/&gt;and we&#8217;re asking for long guarantees.</p>
      <p>That position has not been changed.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- So, that&#8217;s a yes.</p>
      <p>- That&#8217;s a yes.</p>
      <p>- Good.</p>
      <p>That&#8217;s what I wanted you to say,&lt;br/&gt;so if you just said yes, that easy.</p>
      <p>Now, with regards to the loan guarantees,&lt;br/&gt;given again what&#8217;s happened,</p>
      <p>do you and the president, want the congress&lt;br/&gt;to support the full 36 billion</p>
      <p>that you had put in the president&#8217;s budget?</p>
      <p>- Yes.</p>
      <p>- Okay. You&#8217;re learning.</p>
      <p>[laughing]</p>
      <p>- You&#8217;re not a not noble prize winner&lt;br/&gt;for nothing, I guess.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Joe Cosgrove] I&#8217;m a common person.&lt;br/&gt;I really don&#8217;t wanna label putting on me.</p>
      <p>I don&#8217;t feel I&#8217;m an activist.&lt;br/&gt;I don&#8217;t feel I&#8217;m anti-nuclear.</p>
      <p>I turn on the light switch.</p>
      <p>I wanna pay a reasonable electric bill.</p>
      <p>I have questions if it should be built&lt;br/&gt;next to our people, live, drink.</p>
      <p>If they are gonna build more of these reactors,&lt;br/&gt;it all boils down to the issue</p>
      <p>which was trusting the agencies&lt;br/&gt;and trusting the industry.</p>
      <p>How are they gonna do it differently?</p>
      <p>Do you really learn from your mistakes?</p>
      <p>That&#8217;s my major question right now&lt;br/&gt;at this point of time.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>[car running]</p>
      <p>- We should be worrying about&lt;br/&gt;the entire range of problems</p>
      <p>that opposed by an aging nuclear fleet&lt;br/&gt;that is a 20th century technology</p>
      <p>that looks pretty scary&lt;br/&gt;on the 21st century world.</p>
      <p>We need to continue to push&lt;br/&gt;the Nuclear Regulatory Commission</p>
      <p>to protect the public from true risks&lt;br/&gt;not to keep this industry operating.</p>
      <p>- The NRC always had critics--&lt;br/&gt;probably always will.</p>
      <p>People wanna know could the nuclear power plant&lt;br/&gt;in their community be affected</p>
      <p>the way those Japanese reactors were&lt;br/&gt;and they wanna know</p>
      <p>what their federal regulators doing&lt;br/&gt;to ensure that it would not occur.</p>
      <p>- [Gregory] I fully expected they&#8217;re going&lt;br/&gt;to be lessons that we&#8217;re going to learn</p>
      <p>and likely because of those lessons,&lt;br/&gt;we&#8217;ll be making changes to the way</p>
      <p>that we do business and the way&lt;br/&gt;that the industry does business.</p>
      <p>The safety of these plants is our foremost task.&lt;br/&gt;And I think if you look at the operation</p>
      <p>of most of these plants,&lt;br/&gt;the track record has been pretty good.</p>
      <p>I think the overseer of the NRC has played&lt;br/&gt;a big role on that.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- I&#8217;m not here for the money.&lt;br/&gt;I&#8217;m not for sale.</p>
      <p>I&#8217;m here because our community was affected&lt;br/&gt;negatively by nuclear accident.</p>
      <p>I&#8217;ve been doing it for 31 years,&lt;br/&gt;so I don&#8217;t get rich doing this</p>
      <p>nobody&#8217;s paying me to do this.</p>
      <p>What I wanted to do and this has happened&lt;br/&gt;quite frequently is that after Fukushima,</p>
      <p>a lot of attention has been refocused&lt;br/&gt;on nuclear power.</p>
      <p>There&#8217;s a lot of people here I know.</p>
      <p>Most of who I thought would be&lt;br/&gt;in prison by now,</p>
      <p>but I think we&#8217;re all one community.</p>
      <p>I don&#8217;t view as being antinuclear&lt;br/&gt;or pronuclear-- we&#8217;re procommunity.</p>
      <p>I just think it&#8217;s time for us to face up&lt;br/&gt;be adult as they look.</p>
      <p>We&#8217;re not mature enough as a civilization&lt;br/&gt;to harness the atom.</p>
      <p>Maybe sometime down the road, but not now.</p>
      <p>We have the opportunity to do it differently.</p>
      <p>To do it correctly. To do it cleanly.</p>
      <p>We chose not to and that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s&lt;br/&gt;an intersection on money and politics</p>
      <p>and it meets at your local nuclear power plant.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- [Kelly] They&#8217;ve never said I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
      <p>They&#8217;ve never admitted to being&lt;br/&gt;anything but a good neighbor.</p>
      <p>If they don&#8217;t understand what they did&lt;br/&gt;to Long Island, then how can we communicate</p>
      <p>the possibilities are.</p>
      <p>What the possible risks are&lt;br/&gt;for the rest of the United States</p>
      <p>if we start building nuclear reactors again.</p>
      <p>We all lived down the downstream from something.&lt;br/&gt;Really, the only thing you can do is learn</p>
      <p>about what you&#8217;re downstream from&lt;br/&gt;and try and protect yourself from it.</p>
      <p>The only thing that makes me&lt;br/&gt;not completely hopeless, is really my son.</p>
      <p>When I first became pregnant, you know,&lt;br/&gt;one of the big question is where to raise him?</p>
      <p>And when we found the perfect place,&lt;br/&gt;it was one of the few counties</p>
      <p>that I&#8217;ve ever come across that it doesn&#8217;t&lt;br/&gt;have anything that comes up on the APA&#8217;s search.</p>
      <p>I thought yes, this, this is where&lt;br/&gt;I can happily and safely raise him.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>- But again, it&#8217;s that bolder on ... feeling</p>
      <p>that the invisible somehow will lace&lt;br/&gt;the air that I breathe,</p>
      <p>the water that I drink.</p>
      <p>It just feels like any moment,&lt;br/&gt;it&#8217;s gonna walk up my driveway.</p>
      <p>&#9834;[guitar playing]&#9834;</p>
      <p>&#9834;[music]&#9834;</p>
