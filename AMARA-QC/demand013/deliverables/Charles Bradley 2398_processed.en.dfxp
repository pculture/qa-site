      <p begin="00:37:18.920" end="00:37:21.078">Then all of a sudden, I saw this guy stop.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:21.186" end="00:37:22.608">Picked me up, got in the car.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:22.700" end="00:37:26.993">After he drove about a mile or two miles and there was a StateTrooper</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26.993" end="00:37:29.633">on the side behind him. And put the siren on and pulled him aside.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:29.633" end="00:37:34.785">One of them came up to me and said, "Can I see your identification?"</p>
      <p begin="00:37:35.753" end="00:37:37.353">Well, who's the guy next to you?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:37.353" end="00:37:39.148">I said, "Now that's not my information to give you,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:39.148" end="00:37:40.314">you have to get that information from him."</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.314" end="00:37:43.514">And so he grabbed me, called me a, "Wise Nigger."</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.698" end="00:37:45.440">And he grabbed me and throwed me against the car,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:47.023">put the handcuffs on me.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47.023" end="00:37:49.201">He said, "I'd take you to the woods and bust your brains out.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:49.355" end="00:37:51.486">When I ask you a question, don't act wise with me."</p>
      <p begin="00:37:51.624" end="00:37:55.210">And I stayed there and then his partner came over and said, "Hey man."</p>
      <p begin="00:37:55.333" end="00:37:57.660">Took him to the side, said something to him.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:58.479" end="00:38:01.095">And then his partner, he kind of apologized to me.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:01.326" end="00:38:04.372">Took the handcuffs off me and told me get in the car and go ahead.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:04.510" end="00:38:05.545">And I left.</p>

      <p begin="00:38:26.766" end="00:38:31.446">I said, I know a bus--if a truck hit me I know I'm gone, a car hit me I may live.</p>

      <p begin="00:38:38.633" end="00:38:42.718">and he played this one song, Take It to the Limit One More Time.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.701" end="00:38:46.110">Seemed to me that was God talking to me,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46.217" end="00:38:51.578">I was at the end of my rope.When I heard that song, I started crying.</p>
