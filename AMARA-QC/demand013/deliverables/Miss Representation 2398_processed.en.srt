<i>when you begin to see things more clearly.</i>

70
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:52,712
<i>When I found out I was pregnant</i>
with a girl, everything came into focus.

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,297
<i>But I looked around me</i>
and I was really frightened for her.

72
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,170
I couldn't imagine
that my daughter could grow up

73
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:06,881
to be emotionally healthy and fulfilled,
given our modern culture.

74
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:11,546
<i>So I'm compelled to make sense</i>
of all of this for her.

75
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:15,525
And I know I have to start
by looking at my own life.

76
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:20,367
The mistakes I've made
and the traps I've fallen into.

77
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,027
<i>Because even though</i>
I've had many privileges,

78
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:29,468
<i>I haven't been immune to the damage</i>
our culture does to women and girls.

79
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,945
<i>When I was a young girl, I felt secure</i>
in my place in the world.

80
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:40,281
<i>But as with most girls,</i>
things changed as I got older.

81
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,486
<i>A few days before my 7th birthday,</i>

82
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:49,110
<i>my older sister, Stacy</i>
died in an accident.

83
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:55,594
I blame myself for her death.
And out of guilt and sadness,

84
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,606
I tried to be two daughters,
instead of one.

85
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:05,381
I channeled my pain into
excelling in sports and school.

86
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,281
But no matter how hard I tried,
I somehow felt inadequate.

87
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:16,603
I became increasingly susceptible
to peer pressure.

88
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:18,651
And the bombardment
of media messages,

89
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:23,075
telling me that being strong, smart,
and accomplished was not enough.

90
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:28,991
To be a woman meant constantly striving
for an unattainable ideal of beauty

91
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,932
and approval in the eyes of men.

92
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:36,289
So when a trusted peer
and later a coach,

93
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,747
preyed upon my vulnerability
and violated me,

94
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,305
I was so frightened and ashamed.

95
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,616
I completely shut down.

96
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:50,214
My self worth was at an all-time low.
And I developed an eating disorder

97
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,903
that consumed two years of my life.

98
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,800
It took a lot of love and support for me
to find my strength again.

99
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:05,706
And although my experiences are unique,
my struggle is all too common.

100
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:11,009
<i>It's always hard being a teenage girl,</i>

<i>Is it any wonder teen girls feel</i>

53% of 13 year old girls

Their number increases to 78%

65% of women and girls

17% of teens engage in cutting
and self-injurious behavior

108
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:45,235
Rates of depression among
girls and women have

109

doubled between 2000 and 2010

110

I want a different world for my daughter

But a lot has to change first.

112

towards women and their way
and how they look.

114
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:08,905

to conform to men's ideals.

116
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:16,450
There's this concept of the perfect woman
who looks this certain way,

117
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:20,110
and because women may not look that way,
they're scrutinized.

Or like, "Go get a hamburger."

122
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:35,339
Because people thought

00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:39,210
So, I would like, eat a lot.

154

<i>Also not surprisingly,</i>
young men who are shown

155
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,082
lots of photographs of supermodels,

156
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,072
<i>then judge real women</i>
much more harshly.

157
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:24,661
- <i>The most important thing to understand</i>
about all of these images

158
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:27,869
<i>and how they affect us is that the effect</i>
is primarily subconscious

159
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:30,915
<i>and that it is very harmful,</i>
but that for the most part,

00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:32,748
<i>we're not really aware of that</i>

161

<i>which is why we need to pay</i>
conscious attention to these images.

- [Jim Steyer] The average child
develops over 18 to 24 years.

163
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:41,650
And full brain development
doesn't really occur

164
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,485
until you're into your early twenties.

165
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:48,970
So, the idea that kids at eight or ten
or fifteen have the same level

166
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,078
of intellectual and emotional maturity
as an adult, is nuts.

167

They have different
interpretative abilities.

168
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,153
They have different
emotional abilities.

169
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:59,310
And they're a much more
vulnerable class in society.

- [Katie Couric] I worry about, you know,
how much pressure my daughters feel

173

television show <i>All American Girl</i>,

176
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:29,438
which was the first Asian-American
family show on television,

177
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,155
I had a lot of problems
with the network

178
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:34,599
because they were constantly
telling me that I was too fat.

179
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,002
You know, I became
very anorexic trying to

180
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:42,813
somehow keep this job
that I really wanted to keep.

181
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,514
And you know, they ended up
canceling the television show.

182
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:50,033

that I think many people
aren't aware of,

186
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:01,145
is the whole political economy
of the media.

187
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:07,358
<i>Most media get their revenues</i>
from advertising, you know.

188
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:09,582
so, the non advertising content
of these media

189
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,326

- [Maria] Everybody needs to learn
what the media is really about.

It's really about how they want you
to be something that you're not.

192
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:21,502
- [Jean Kilbourne] A lot of advertising
is based on making people

193
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:23,851
feel anxious and feeling insecure.

194
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:26,728
For men, there's a lot of anxiety
around status and power

keep seeing these same body types

198
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,592
over and over and over again,
because those are the body types

199
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,824
<i>that generate the purchase</i>
of all these beauty products

200

<i>and thus are a futile pursuit</i>
of this idealized body.

201
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,962
It's a hugely profitable pursuit
for these media industries

202
00:12:47,962 --> 00:12:49,351
and for all of the advertisers.

203
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:54,925
Advertisers spent
$235.6 billion in 2009

204
00:12:55,262 --> 00:13:00,015
80% of the countries in the world

205
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:02,773
American women end up spending
much more money on beauty

206

and these myths than on

<i>And so under this rather</i>
equipped empowerment,

209
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:13,049
<i>it's completely disempowering women.</i>

210
00:13:14,062 --> 00:13:17,482
US women spend $12,000
to $15,000 a year

211
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:20,116
on beauty products and salon services

212
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:24,068
The number of cosmetic surgical
procedures performed on youth

213
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,413
under age 19 more than tripled
from 1997 to 2007

214
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:31,401
The average adult facelift
costs $11,429

215
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:34,830
That's enough money to pay for:
5 years at a community college

216
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,769
2 years at a state university
1 year at the University of California

217
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,494
- <i>[Jean Kilbourne] Not only are girls</i>

218
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:44,887

219
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:47,496
- [Caroline Heldman]
<i>The American Psychological Association</i>

220
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:50,611
<i>has found in recent years</i>
that self-objectification

221
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:53,972
<i>has become a national epidemic.</i>
A national problem.

222
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,194
- The more women and girls
self-objectify,

223
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:02,714
the more likely they are to be
depressed, to have eating disorders.

224
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:06,351
They have lower confidence.
They have lower ambition.

225
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,537
<i>They have lower</i>
cognitive functioning.

226
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:10,639
<i>They have lower GPAs.</i>

227
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:13,211
How does this connect
to women and leadership?

228
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,757
Women who are high self-objectifiers
have lower political efficacy.

229
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:22,113
Political efficacy is the idea that
your voice matters in politics

230
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:24,229
and that you can bring about
change in politics.

231
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:28,463
<i>So, if we have a whole generation</i>
of young people being raised

232
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:33,067
<i>where women's objectification is just part</i>
for the course, it's normal, it's okay,

233
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,793
we have a whole generation of women
who are less likely to run for office

234
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,275
and less likely to vote.

<i>- [Jennifer] This is dangerous business.</i>

236

<i>If the media sending girls the message</i>
that their value lies in their bodies,

237
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,222
<i>this can only leave them</i>
feeling disempowered

238
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:57,007
<i>and distract them</i>
from making a difference

239
00:14:57,215 --> 00:14:58,554
<i>and becoming leaders.</i>

240
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:01,674
Women make up
51% of the U.S. population

Yet comprise only
17% of Congress

242

The 2010 mid-term election

243
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:15,255
women have not made
gains in Congress since 1979

244
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:19,480
At this rate, women may not
achieve parity for 500 years

245
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,697
Only 34 women have
ever served as governors

246
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:28,037
compared to 2319 men

247

- [Pat Mitchell] Here we are. This
massively powerful democratic society

248

and we are not modeling for
the rest of the world a better balance.

249
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:42,457
67 countries in the world have had
female presidents or prime ministers

250
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:49,393
The U.S. is not one of them

251
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,489
The U.S. is 88th in the world in terms
of women in national legislatures

252
00:15:53,581 --> 00:15:56,654
- <i>[Gavin Newsom] If people knew</i>

254
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:01,157
than the United States of America,

255
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:03,463
then we'd get some people upset.

256
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:05,605
- [Gloria Steinem] No wonder we are
in such trouble in this country,

260
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:22,324
Something looks fundamentally wrong

261
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,263

they're going to make the wrong decisions.

273

00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:25,011
everything that needed different thinking,
women have been doing it,

298
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:27,080
so we gotta get them
in the tables of power.

299
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,996
- [Condoleezza Rice] Well, two things
have to happen when you talk about

300
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:33,572
women moving to the next rung
or minorities moving to the next rung.

301
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:35,882
First, we have to have the candidates.

302
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,128
You have to have people
who are in the pools

303
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,074
from which these positions are drawn.

304
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:43,161
But you also have to have a kind
of psychological breakthrough

305
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,254
or can an American see a woman
born African-American in that position?

306
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,213
Now I think with women,
we still have a bit to go.

307
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:59,643
- [Jennifer] I knew these obstacles
still existed from my generation,

308
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,473
<i>but I wanted to find out</i>
if things were any better

309
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:04,787
for young women
seeking leadership positions.

310
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:09,252
So I spent time with an exceptional
young woman named, Devanshi Patel,

311
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,302
who aspires to have
a career in public service.

312
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,634
- [Devanshi Patel]
"Well, welcome to Bill Hearing.

313
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:16,728
Tonight is the bill hearing night for

314
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:20,118
The Central Silicon Valley YMCA
Youth and Government Delegation."

315
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:24,351
So, first time I ran for public office
was in 4th grade.

316
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:27,344
My parents award with me.
We made all these flyers

317
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:31,133
with all these cute little slogans
and we campaigned all over the school,

318
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,220
and I was actually the runner-up
by a handful of votes.

319
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,198
I think everyone is born with something

320
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:39,651
that they have to do
and for me, this was it.

321
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:42,401
Every time that I could run for something,
I didn't run for anything less.

322
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:44,938
I didn't run for Vice President
or Treasurer. I ran for President.

323
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,681
- <i>[Ranna Patel] I asked her one day.</i>
I think it was in 5th grade.

324
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:50,249
<i>I said, "Devanshi, you always want</i>
to be a leader,

325
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:52,243
<i>but do you know what a leader is?"</i>

326
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:55,401
She says, "It's very simple, Mama.
They are just servants to people.

327
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:58,933
Leaders are just servants to people."

328
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:02,219
- [Devanshi] I loved the Youth
and Government program.

329
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:05,784
The best way I can give back
is by running for Youth Governor.

330
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,912
- [speaker] How would you solve
the California Budget Crisis?

331
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,070
Starting with Ms. Patel.

332
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:12,034
- [Devanshi] I would cut
unnecessary spending.

333
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,610
Well, when I was running for office,
there were a lot of--

334
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,550
if not outward shows of sexism,
little remarks here and there, like

335
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:20,456
you know, "Oh, she speaks well
for a woman.

336
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:22,329
She's smart for a woman."

337
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,988
There were also a couple instances
with some of my friends

338
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:28,007
<i>when they were going to speak</i>
in front of a large audience

339
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,847
<i>and the only thing people could</i>
focus on was their body,

340
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,208
<i>what they looked like,</i>
what they were wearing.

341
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,511
I thought, you know,
"We're better than this."

342
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:41,983
Devanshi lost the election to one of
her male opponents, coming in second.

343
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:48,561
- [Ranna Patel] She said,"Mama,
looks like I'm another Hilary Clinton."

344
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,028
- [Oliver Mittelstaedt]
Guys will vote for guys.

345
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:51,882
And girls would vote for guys,
but some other time,

346
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:55,004
girls have a harder time getting
the girls do vote girls because

347
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,537
I feel like, girls are
kinda harder on other girls.

348
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:00,777
65% of the 2000 teens who vote
in California's YMCA

349
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:04,915
Youth &amp; Government program are girls.

350
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,796
<i>- [Jennifer] Devanshi's story made me</i>
think about how early

351
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:11,131
<i>girls face a deep gender bias.</i>

352
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:14,642
<i>And how things have not changed</i>
as much as we'd like to think.

353
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,047
- [Gavin Newsom] One of the first things
I did when I became Mayor of San Francisco

354
00:21:19,063 --> 00:21:22,688
is I appointed a female police chief
and then a female fire chief.

355
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,230
When they both show up at the podium,
in a disaster, a lot of national media

356
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,494
would look there and say,
"Well, where is the police chief?"

357
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,946
"She's right here."

358
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,610
"And where's the fire chief?"
"Well, she's right here."

359
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,473
People thought I was trying
to make some grand statement,

360
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:40,282
when in fact, I was actually just hiring
the most qualified two candidates.

361
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:44,804
The incredible opposition
was coming mostly from women.

362
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:48,213
And those that feel it's much
too soon, too fast,

363
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:51,030
they never would've question
at how they've been men.

364
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:53,405
- [Caroline Heldman]
Little boys and little girls

365
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:54,486
when they're seven years old,

366
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:57,148
an equal number want to be
President of the United States

367
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:58,966
when they grow up, about 30%.

368
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:02,226
<i>But then, you ask the same</i>
question when they're 15

369
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:04,156
<i>and you see this massive gap emerging.</i>

370
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:06,247
<i>So, we have this gendered socialization,</i>

371
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:08,348
<i>where politics is considered</i>
to be for men.

372
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:10,571
<i>Leadership is considered to be</i>
a masculine pursuit

373
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:15,109
and women are discouraged
from pursuing ambitious positions.

374
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:23,780
You can't be what you can't see.
-Marian Wright Edelman

375
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:26,900
- [Carol Jenkins] I think what happens is
that if you do not have women there,

376
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:30,721
then girls do not see
that they can be that.

377
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:35,841
So, it's really what you see
that inspires your idea of

378
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,770
what's possible for you in the world.

379
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:40,331
- [Krystal Ball] "I do disagree
with Sarah Palin on a lot of issues,

380
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:43,514
but seeing her up on stage there
with her young family

381
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:46,135
and her young baby was just beautiful.

382
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:48,755
And I thought, 'You know what?
Maybe I could give this a shot as well.'"

383
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:54,445
68% of viewers were more likely
to accept a female president

384
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:58,402
- [Marie Wilson] Having this opportunity
to see women, to see women leadership,

385
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,352
to see women's leadership in reality
and on the screen

386
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:04,708
and on the television,
is huge for women. Huge.

387
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:08,214
Because you don't have that
many women really in leadership.

388
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:10,916
So the way that it gets done
to a certain extent

389
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:14,327
and way problems get solved
often have to do with Hollywood.

390
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:17,738
And the films that get made.
The documentaries, the television shows,

391
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:21,714
start where people are
and people are watching television.

392
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:26,398
- <i>[Jennifer] There are some examples</i>
of films and TV shows

393
00:23:26,398 --> 00:23:28,298
<i>that portray powerful women.</i>

394
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:32,617
<i>But in general, the situation</i>
in Hollywood is pretty bleak.

395
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:35,988
CANCELLED AFTER ONE SEASON

396
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:39,827
I decided to pursue acting
professionally at the age of 28.

397
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,721
And was hopeful I could find
complex roles to play.

398
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:46,939
My first reality check came when
my agent told me to lie about my age

399
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:50,259
and remove my Stanford MBA
from my resume

400
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,885
because it might be threatening.

401
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:54,426
Well, I didn't do either.

402
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:56,608
But my confidence was really shaken.

403
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:00,833
My second reality check came when
I learned that there were very few

404
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,530
multi-dimensional roles
to even audition for.

405
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:06,017
I shouldn't have been surprised.

406
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:07,965
<i>Because when you really look</i>
at Hollywood

407
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:09,838
<i>and the films that are being made,</i>

408
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:11,591
you see the same stereotypes

409
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:14,913

- [Ilian] Women are never the protagonist.
They're the ones who,

424
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,138
if they are the protagonist,
it's something drama about

425
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:13,815
<i>getting a guy or something.</i>

426
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:16,427
It's never really about
finding your destiny or whatever,

427
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:17,656
how they stayed for the guys.

428
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:21,024
<i>Like in the </i>Star Trek,<i> on this</i>
is your destiny and you know,

429
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:22,478
<i>being powerful,</i>
being the captain.

430
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:26,401
<i>But for girls, they wouldn't say that.</i>
And then, what's weird about it

431
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:30,135
is that it seemed normal for us,
like, we don't question it.

432
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:33,102
We don't say, "Oh, why isn't the girl
being the protagonist for this?

433
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:34,506
Why can't a girl be powerful?"

434
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:39,617
Only 16% of protagonists
in films are female

435
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,275
- [Geena Davis] I hear this all the time.
Well, things are getting better.

436
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:46,339
I mean, things are getting better,
you know. But, they're not.

437
00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:49,795
- [Caroline Heldman] Mainstream movies
are genuinely stories of men's lives

438
00:25:49,891 --> 00:25:53,372
which revolve around men.
And then we have this sub-genre

439
00:25:53,372 --> 00:25:55,831
<i>called, Chic Flicks, which are stories</i>
of women's lives,

440
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:59,471
<i>which when you look at them</i>
a little more closely, you realize that

441
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:01,858
<i>they generally revolve</i>
around men's lives, too.

442
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:03,632
<i>They revolve around trying to get a man,</i>

443
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:06,986
<i>trying to get love, get married</i>

447
00:26:17,006 --> 00:26:20,365
- [Geena Davis] Between 1937 and 2005,

448
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:25,382
there were only 13 female protagonists
in animated movies.

449
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:30,482
All of them, except one,
had the aspiration of finding romance.

450
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:33,713
- [Lisa Ling] As a culture, women are
brought up to just be kind of

451
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:36,630
fundamentally insecure
and always looking for the time

452
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:42,795

and rescue us or provide for us.

<i>- [Caroline Heldman] When it comes to</i>
female leaders in entertainment media,

454
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,986

has sacrificed family and love

455

<i>Hire the smart, fat girl."</i>

457
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:02,082
- The whole movie is about
bringing her down a peg

458
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:05,385
and this is generally done by someone
who is under her, a subordinate,

459
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:08,876
typically a male, so that image
doesn't bode well,

460
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:12,403
when it comes to ideas
of women in leadership.

461
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:15,864

interesting characters on screen

462
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:18,623
in the 20s, 30s, 40s
than we do now.

463
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:22,809
And we allowed women to really
embody all the contradictions

464
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,651
<i>that make up a human being</i>
back then.

465
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:27,273
<i>They could be the</i> femme fatale

466
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:30,208
<i>and then turn around</i>
and be the mother.

467
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,723
<i>And then turn around</i>
and be the seductress.

468
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:36,242
And then turn and be the saint.
And we accepted that.

469
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:38,971
They were complex human beings.

470
00:27:38,982 --> 00:27:41,729

Witch and Sexy Kitten."

a mouthful there, sister."

473
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:50,539

we don't understand characters

474
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:53,397

willing to put ourselves

475
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:57,503
in the skin of those characters
and women, I think, terrify us.

476
00:27:58,091 --> 00:28:00,091
<i>We tend not to write women</i>
as human beings.

477

<i>It's cartoons we're making now.</i>

478

480
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,576

of women as sex objects.

481
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:16,014
<i>In rock videos, rapping, hip hop videos.</i>
in all the summer blockbusters,

for young male viewers.

483
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:23,233
- [Joshua] I think when they
do put in the part,

484
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:28,156
she's used as a sexual object or the
object of desire a lot toward the men,

485
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:29,642
which I think should change a lot

486
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:32,949
because there's still a lot more
to women than just a body.

487
00:28:34,274 --> 00:28:37,005

<i>is that the majority of female characters</i>

And that really skews our perceptions.

yet are 71% of women on TV

It's like when a female

she simply needs to go away.

that I had heard about others getting

549
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,772
and that was this.
I had just gotten a series

550
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:03,267
and it was presented to me
by my managers,

"Daphne, you're part is secure.
But would you consider doing

a little Botox or collagen or something?"

00:32:10,124 --> 00:32:11,873
Well, just like them,
I didn't know what the hell it was.

"What do you mean Botox
or collagen or something?"

555
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:22,689

with this fat bald man injecting,

556
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:27,508
needles in my forehead,
bleeding and I'm crying

and I'm feeling guilty for crying.

558
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:33,274

"There's something wrong here."

560

to have my back teeth pulled out.

You know, I wasn't good enough

Women exist to be stupid.

582

591
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:34,228
- <i>"Please, pick me, pick me, pick me.</i>
See how beautiful I am."

592
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:37,523
<i>- [M. Gigi Durham] There's a really</i>
unequal power relationship going on there,

593
00:34:37,537 --> 00:34:39,822
<i>where it's the girls whose bodies</i>
are on display and the boys

594
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:41,437
<i>get the power to arbitrate and judge,</i>

595
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:43,723
whether their bodies
are acceptable or not acceptable,

596
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:45,289
<i>desirable or not desirable. </i>

597
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,760
So, I think there's
a whole lot going on there

598
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,490
that actually puts girls in
a really disempowered position.

599
00:34:50,903 --> 00:34:53,696
- <i>[Jennifer Pozner] These shows over</i>
the course of the last decade,

600
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:57,996
have tried to portray a world in which,
the only options available to women

601
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:01,976
mimic the 1950s model of femininity,
in which women's only power

602
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:05,189
was her beauty, in which women
not only had no choices,

603
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:09,041
<i>but shouldn't have even wanted any,</i>
in which men wore burdens

604
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,471
<i>with the responsibility of being</i>
the prince charming,

605
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:15,014
<i>who comes in and whisks women away</i>
to happily ever after.

606
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:17,508
<i>Then has to provide for their</i>
financial security.

607
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:23,055
Nobody wins in this model, but
women particularly, lose in this model,

608
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:26,242
where they're expected to look
like Miss USA, have sex

609
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:29,029
like Samantha on <i>Sex and the City</i>
and think like June Cleaver.

610
00:35:34,242 --> 00:35:37,400
- <i>[Jennifer] And here's something I find</i>
even more disheartening.

611
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,348
<i>Watching the news.</i>

612
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:43,720
<i>So many female journalists</i>
are objectified or sexualized.

613
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:51,505
- <i>♪ [CBS theme music ] ♪ This is the CBS</i>
Evening News with Katie Couric.

614
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,755
- "Hi, everyone. I'm very happy
to be with you tonight."

615
00:35:57,067 --> 00:36:00,415
<i>- [Carol Jenkins] Katie Couric was</i>
the very first national experience

616
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:04,858
we had all together viewing.
The woman who was not entertaining us,

617
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:07,064
<i>but whose presence and presentation</i>

618
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,655
<i>was vital for anything information</i>
that we needed.

619
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:12,495
- [Katie Couric] The three major
evening newscasts had been

620
00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:14,517
dominated by white males.

621
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:16,982
<i>They had very similar faces </i>

622
00:36:16,982 --> 00:36:19,871
<i>and very similar backgrounds</i>
for the most part.

623
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:23,170
I thought this is an opportunity
to mix it up a little bit.

624
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,543
I also thought it was an important message
that a woman could be as confident

625
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:30,650
as a man in an important powerful role.

626
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,071
- [Carol Jenkins] And I remember
in the early days,

627
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:34,133
when I would get calls
from reporters about,

628
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:35,752
"Ah! That we have our
first woman anchor.

629
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:37,093
What do you think about that?"

630
00:36:38,261 --> 00:36:40,874
Inevitably, the questions
that they would ask first, were,

631
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:42,130
<i>"What about those legs?"</i>

632
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,079
<i>"Do you think she was</i>
showing too much leg?", or

633
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:47,343
"What about that winter white,
wasn't that a big mistake?"

634
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:50,911
<i>They were all observations</i>
that had to do with her physicality

635
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:52,892
and not really about the content at all.

636
00:36:52,892 --> 00:36:55,388
But again it's because
as I've always said,

637
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:57,779
"We are a nation of teenage boys."

638
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:01,051
We don't know, you know,
what to make of this woman

639
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:04,572
sitting in front of us and so you know,
we look at her legs, her boobs,

640
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:08,368
her hair, her whatever, you know.
Then maybe way down the line,

641
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,776
we'll get to listen to what she's saying.

642
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:13,732
- [Rachel Maddow] Ever since
I've been in media at all,

643
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,385
even since, you know,
the first morning show that I was on

644
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:20,124
in Holyoke, Massachusetts, you know,
I was this sidekick newsgirl.

645
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:24,263
There's been like
a really consistent proportion of--

646
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:28,005
I don't even know if I call it criticism.
Essentially, it's hate mail.

647
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:31,771
As I've become sort of better known
and I get more feedback,

648
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,953
the amount of
"I hate you, homophobic.

649
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:39,237
I hate what you look like.
I'm gonna kill you."

650
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,569
Like threatening mail stuff,
it's like the proportions

651
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:44,896
has stayed exactly the same.

652
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:50,038
It's always 14% of the feedback
and it's almost all of the hate mail

653
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,704
is about gender and sexuality.
I mean, who has the time

654
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:57,397
if that's really what you think
and you really are that bad a speller,

655
00:37:57,397 --> 00:38:00,371
like you really, you're still gonna
take this time to let me know

656
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:04,450
what you 'thunk' about--
[laughs] about what I look like?

657
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:10,716
- [Lisa Ling] It's the scrutinization
that women get

658
00:38:11,344 --> 00:38:15,149
that far surpasses
the scrutinization that men get.

659
00:38:15,313 --> 00:38:20,416
I don't ever see gossip columns
or tabloids reporting

660
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,914
on Brian Williams' personal life,
yet Katie Couric

661
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:30,405
and what she is wearing
or who she's dating is headline news.

662
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:33,841
- [Katie Couric] I think whenever there
are two women who are working

663
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:39,496
in similar professions, it's
automatically positioned as a cat fight.

664
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:43,024
Diane Sawyer and I were pitted
against each other as if, you know,

665
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:46,216
we were gonna be in a mud wrestling
competition on the weekends.

666
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:50,579
And you never saw that with say,
Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings.

667
00:38:51,017 --> 00:38:53,374
- "Take it away with the red hot boys
in blue, which--"

668
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,611
- "I got this one down."

669
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:55,424
- "Okay, good."

670
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:57,749
- Sometimes I look on
the cable news channels.

671
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:02,880
I see women wearing very low cut shirts
and lots of makeup

672
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:06,972
and you know, their hair is kind of
tussled and they look like

673
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:10,652
they're working as cocktail waitresses,
instead of newscasters.

674
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:14,043
It's just a very mixed message.

675
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:15,623
- [Jay Leno] "Folks, we're gonna
play a game.

676
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,153
I'm gonna show you
a photo of a woman.

677
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:18,348
You have to guess,
whether she is

678
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:21,690
a professional newscaster
or a Hooters waitress.

679
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,098
Are you ready? Here we go."
[audience laugh]

680
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,621
- [Jennifer Pozner] The local news
anchorships look like,

681
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:29,004
you know, somebody's grandfather
and his second wife.

682
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,914
- [Katie Couric] Television's a
very visual medium, obviously,

683
00:39:32,914 --> 00:39:35,803
and it's kind of how do you
walk the fine line

684
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:40,754
of looking pleasing and attractive,
but also looking professional.

685
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:43,928
I look back on my <i>Today's Show</i>
interviews then I think,

686
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,269
"Geez, my skirt is way too short."

687
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:50,432
I sometimes worry that I started
this thing with my legs and everything

688
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,031
that I have sort of started this trend
of trying to look, you know...

689
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,233
I don't know.

690
00:39:58,627 --> 00:40:02,732
- [Lisa Ling] There is so much pressure
to look a certain way.

691
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:08,233
When I'm on television, I never try
and explicitly dress sexy.

692
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,398
I don't want to distract from
the stories that I'm telling.

693
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:13,262
- [Rachel Maddow] I want you
to focus on what I'm saying.

694
00:40:13,262 --> 00:40:15,308
There's a lot of words in my show
and I work really hard

695
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:17,711
on getting them in the right order.
[laughs]

696
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:19,295
For some people, I will always be

697
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:22,153
too hideous a creature
to be on television. That's fine.

698
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,393
But if you can get over that on day one,
it's gonna stay the same

699
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:27,023
for the whole time that I'm on the air.

700
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:29,532
- [Katie Couric] I think it's really hard
for women today.

701
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,133
- <i>[Jennifer] The emphasis on</i>
women's appearance affects

702
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,367
<i>more than just women on screen.</i>

703
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:42,363
<i>It's affecting women's ability</i>
to participate in the political process.

704
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:49,236
<i>Ironically, the more power women gain,</i>
the stronger the backlash against them.

705
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:51,933
- <i>And this phenomenon is most evident </i>

706
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:55,415
<i>in the way the media disrespects</i>
our female leaders.

707
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:59,373
- "She's irresistibly cute.
Let's put it that way.

708
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,720
In the way she presents herself,
obviously, she's attractive and all that."

709
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,747
- "Sarah Palin looks
really hot in that hat.

710

She's just sad that she
doesn't know how cars work.

711
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:12,809
Aww, that's crazy.
Have you seen the hat on her?"

712
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:16,856
- "Both you and Sarah Palin

-"Kagan is gonna put on the
US Supreme Court

715

as there's such a thing about

716
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:26,948
Let's put that here that so
she's not your type of face

the big female leadership

- "And Hilary Rodham Clinton,
her thighness, is no better

736
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:19,465
than Dumbo with the big ears."

737
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:22,794
- "When she raises her voice
and when a lot of women do, you know,

738
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:26,678
it's as I say, it reaches a point where--
- "Yeah, well, look, you know what?"

739
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:29,159
--with every husband in America
has heard it one time or another."

740
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,278
- "You get a woman in the oval office,
the most powerful person in the world,

741
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:34,590
what's the downside?"

742
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,180
- "You mean, besides the PMS
and the mood swings."

743
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:42,261
- [Pat Mitchell] There's probably
no more powerful influence

744
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:45,920
in the way we view power than
the way media treats power.

745
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:50,114
And media treats power
as defined by men,

746
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:53,737
because it has been
throughout our generation

747
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,339
and the ones before
generally define that way.

748
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:59,097
- [Erika Falk] When press representations
of women who are, you know,

749
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:01,957
running for the highest office
in the land are focusing, for example,

750
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:06,464
on how women look,
instead of what they've done

751
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:10,222
or their issue positions.
That's got to impact the audience

752
00:43:10,222 --> 00:43:12,797
in terms of how they evaluate
and judge those women.

753
00:43:12,986 --> 00:43:15,293
One of the things it does
is it trivializes them.

754
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:17,697
It makes women seem less powerful.

755
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:20,798
- [Jennifer Pozner] During the
Democratic National Convention in '84,

756
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:22,907
when Geraldine Ferraro was running,

757
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:25,367
she was introduced on
national television as,

758
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:29,155
"The first female vice presidential
candidate. Size six!"

759
00:43:30,437 --> 00:43:32,360
So this is not new.

760
00:43:32,754 --> 00:43:35,631
- [Debbie Walsh] My colleague did a study
looking at Elizabeth Dole

761
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:39,275
and her race for President,
she was coming in second in Iowa

762
00:43:39,275 --> 00:43:43,655
at the time after George Bush
and there was much more coverage

763
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:48,918
of her appearance than there was of the
substance of what she was talking about.

764
00:43:49,996 --> 00:43:52,223
- [Jennifer Lawless] When I ran for
Congress, I was campaigning

765
00:43:52,223 --> 00:43:56,781
at grocery stores and a woman came up
to me and she put her arms around me

766
00:43:56,817 --> 00:43:59,959
and she whispered, "Don't worry,
you don't look nearly as fat in real life

767
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:03,335
as you do on TV."
The week before the election,

768
00:44:03,335 --> 00:44:06,018
a man came up to me and he said,
"You know, you seem great,

769
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,820
but I don't feel like
I could vote for you for Congress.

770
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,702
I feel like I should hire you
as a babysitter."

771
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:13,602
- [Nancy Pelosi] When I first ran for
public office, which is now

772
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:17,653
over 20 years ago, although my
youngest was a senior in high school,

773
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:19,666
the question I was most
frequently asked was,

774
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:21,782
"Who's gonna be taking care
of your children?"

775
00:44:21,983 --> 00:44:24,021
And of course it's one of
those questions that

776
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:27,654
I don't think a man has ever been asked
when he has run for office.

777
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:29,474
- [Erika Falk] If you look at
the women who ran,

778
00:44:29,474 --> 00:44:32,325
who had honorary titles like,
Senator Clinton,

779
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,475
if the press drops that title and
instead refers to them as Mrs. Clinton,

780
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:40,380
this is a way to kind of diminish
some of her accomplishments.

781
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,679
In John Boehner's first four weeks
as Speaker of the House

782
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,715
he was on the cover of five
national weekly magazines.

783
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:50,637
In Nancy Pelosi's four years
as Speaker of the House

784
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:52,377
she was on the cover of zero
national weekly magazines.

785
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:55,122
- [Dianne Feinstein] There is such a thing
as a media bias.

786
00:44:55,122 --> 00:45:00,130
For example, media will write in the
same way about a man and a woman.

787
00:45:01,185 --> 00:45:04,323
Senator X is a woman,
complained that--

788
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:09,090
and in the same thing,
Senator Y, stated that--

789
00:45:09,651 --> 00:45:11,600
So the man will get the <i>stated</i>

790
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,545
and the woman will get
the negative verb, <i>complained.</i>

791
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:20,431
- [Erika Falk] Women were twice as likely
to be described emotionally as were men.

792
00:45:20,627 --> 00:45:26,206
And by painting women as more emotional
than men, we perpetuate this stereotype

793
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:28,415
that women are emotional.
Therefore, they're irrational.

794
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:30,244
Therefore they can't handle a crisis.

795
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:32,501
Therefore, they should not be
in leadership positions.

796
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,245
- [Condoleezza Rice] I remember
so many times during the campaign,

797
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:39,467
people asking, "Will she tough enough
to be Commander-in-Chief?"

798
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:42,677
Well, I've know plenty of men who aren't
tough enough to be Commander-in-Chief

799
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:44,880
and nobody asked that question.

800
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,237
- "Making sure that these kids
have a shot at the American dream...

801
00:45:50,237 --> 00:45:54,714
[sobbing]
...my God, it's important."

802
00:45:54,936 --> 00:45:57,639
- "Gosh. What do you think
they would have done to Nancy Pelosi

803
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:01,353
if she hadn't gotten all worked up?
They would've said she's unstable,

804
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,557
couldn't do the job.
Ooh, yes. Welcome to America."

805
00:46:08,668 --> 00:46:12,357
- [Pat Mitchell] A woman in power
is often seen as a negative thing.

806
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:17,892
We associate all the worst aspects
of power and we translate those

807
00:46:17,953 --> 00:46:21,164
to a woman seeking to achieve power.

808
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:23,266
- [Caroline Heldman] One of the key ways

809
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:28,317
in which media played a role
in the primary, was to talk about

810
00:46:28,317 --> 00:46:31,578
Hillary Clinton's ambition
as though it were a bad thing.

811
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:37,031
- "When Barack Obama speaks,
men hear, 'Take off for the future'.

812
00:46:37,434 --> 00:46:41,650
And when Hillary Clinton speaks,
men hear, 'Take out the garbage.'"

813
00:46:41,853 --> 00:46:45,289
- "When she reacts the way she reacts
to Obama with just a look,

814
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:46,677
the look toward him,
looking like,

815
00:46:46,677 --> 00:46:49,956
everyone's first wife standing
outside a probate court."

816
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:51,561
- <i>"I don't know what they're</i>
getting at here, Tuck.

817
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:52,870
<i>But what do you think are</i>
they saying about Hillary?"

818
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:57,227
- "I don't know, but that is so perfect,
a guy would have often said." [both laugh]

819
00:46:57,227 --> 00:47:00,839
"When she comes on television,
I involuntarily cross my legs."

820
00:47:00,893 --> 00:47:02,122
- "I know you do."

821
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:06,551
- Hillary Clinton had hecklers
following her saying, "Iron my shirt."

822
00:47:06,714 --> 00:47:09,215
- "And some people think
- [Hecklers shouting] <i>"Iron my shirt!"</i>

823
00:47:09,215 --> 00:47:13,258
- we bring about saying, I--"
- <i>"Iron my shirt! Iron my shirt!"</i>

824
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:16,615
- She was frequently called
a bitch in mainstream media.

825
00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:20,324
- "She's a stereotypical bitch,
you know what I mean?"

826
00:47:20,472 --> 00:47:24,066
- "Obama did great in February that was
because it was black history month.

827
00:47:24,164 --> 00:47:27,581
And now Hillary is doing much better
because it's white bitch month, right?"

828
00:47:28,418 --> 00:47:31,886
- "If she knew how it made her look,
so alternately sappy and bitchy,

829
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:34,584
she'd stop it, but she can't
help herself, can she?"

830
00:47:34,671 --> 00:47:36,777
- Her credentials were
constantly questioned.

831
00:47:36,777 --> 00:47:40,187
- "Let's not forget and I'll be brutal.
The reason she's a US Senator,

832
00:47:40,187 --> 00:47:43,320
the reason she's a candidate
for President, the reason she may be

833
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,006
a front runner, is her husband
messed around." -"Yeah, but--"

834
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:47,956
"That's how she got to be Senator
for New York. We keep forgetting it.

835
00:47:47,956 --> 00:47:49,409
She didn't win there on her merit."

836
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:55,047
<i>- [Caroline] Sarah Palin presented</i>
a very different image.

837
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:59,271
She is the first national high profiled
female candidate

838
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:04,659
who presented herself in very
feminine terms as a "real woman."

839
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:07,070
- "She's the American dream.
Women want to be her.

840
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:10,301
Men want to mate with her.
I wanna lay her next to me in bed."

841
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:15,652
- There were pictures shot
between her legs of folks

842
00:48:15,652 --> 00:48:17,678
at the Republican National Convention.

843
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,738
In a nutshell, she was
<i>pornified</i> and <i>ditzified</i>

844
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:25,368
"I don't wanna say she's a ditz,
but last night,

845
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:28,057
my stripper's fake name
was Sarah Palin." <i>[crowd laughs]</i>

846
00:48:28,444 --> 00:48:31,445
- "Yo, let me tell you somethin'
'bout Sarah Palin, man, [all laugh]

847
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:35,098
she's good masturbation material."
- [Together] Oh! [all laugh]

848
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,825
- So, Hillary Clinton tried to be
properly masculine

849
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:40,463
and properly feminine and she lost.

850
00:48:40,672 --> 00:48:45,203
Sarah Palin puts out this different image
of, shall we say hyper femininity,

851
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:48,438
and she gets beaten up in
really degrading gendered ways.

852
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:54,994
- "But tonight we are crossing party lines
to address the now very ugly role

853
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:58,044
that sexism is playing in the campaign."

854
00:48:58,255 --> 00:49:03,090
- "An issue which I am frankly, surprised
to hear, people suddenly care about."

855
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,542
<i>[crowd laughs]</i>

856
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,214
- "Reporters and commentators
stop using words

00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:13,348
that diminish us, like pretty,
attractive, beautiful--"

858
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:17,823
- "Harpy, shrewd, boner shrinker."

859
00:49:17,923 --> 00:49:22,189
<i>[crowd laughs and applauds]</i>

860
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:27,079
- [Cory Booker] My worry is now that
there are millions of people watching

861
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,711
Sarah Palin, Hillary Clinton...
I could talk to about a lot of women

862
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:33,121
there in New Jersey politics.
There are millions of young women

863
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:36,091
watching this and the messages
that they're getting are just not

864
00:49:36,091 --> 00:49:40,187
conducive to encouraging them
to put up with this kind of abuse.

865
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:44,034
- [Gavin Newsom] When you're not
treated the same, you are dehumanized.

866
00:49:44,078 --> 00:49:47,270
When you're not given the same
opportunity, you're dehumanized.

867
00:49:47,354 --> 00:49:50,472
When people look at you differently
because you happen to be a woman

868
00:49:50,472 --> 00:49:55,255
and you happen to be in a position
of some influence that someone

869
00:49:55,255 --> 00:49:59,631
who is a man, would naturally be in
based on tradition or history

870
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:03,337
and people question your qualifications,
that's dehumanizing.

871
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:09,370
- [Thomas] Empowered women in general,
threaten men because they feel

872
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,721
that an empowered woman
is just putting down a man

873
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:16,634
as opposed to trying
to sort of raise herself.

874
00:50:16,997 --> 00:50:20,187
- [Jackson Katz] As women have been
challenging men's power, in business,

875
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:22,338
in the professions, in education,

876
00:50:22,338 --> 00:50:26,463
and in politics and other areas
of social life,

877
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,266
the images of women that have
been flooding their culture,

878
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:33,187
have been showing women
as taking up less space.

879
00:50:33,187 --> 00:50:36,021
They're less threatening.
They're highly sexualized.

880
00:50:36,218 --> 00:50:39,704
And therefore, a certain kind of power
has been taken away from them,

881
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,632
which is a power of being
a whole person.

882
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,844
And I don't think those things
are coincidental. I think that the way

883
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:51,005
that the symbolic realm has been acting
as to take power away from women,

884
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:54,296
while women have been challenging
men's power in the concrete realm.

885
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:00,542
- <i>[Jennifer] It seems we become numb</i>
to the insidious ways

886
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:04,045
<i>the media holds women back</i>
when it misrepresents them.

887
00:51:06,332 --> 00:51:10,167
<i>I can't help but wonder, who are</i>
the people behind the scenes

888
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,089
<i>making these crucial decisions</i>
about what we see?

889
00:51:14,346 --> 00:51:18,225
<i>And what are the consequences</i>
for my daughter and her generation?

890
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,539
- [Barbara J. Berg] The media
has always been,

891
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,917
overwhelmingly,
in the hands of men.

892
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:53,430
Women own only 5.8% of all television
stations and 6% radio stations.

893
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:57,225
- [Jennifer Pozner] As you go up the ranks
in media, fewer and fewer women

894
00:51:57,225 --> 00:52:00,413
and people of color exist
at every rung of the ladder.

895
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:02,253
Women hold only 3% of clout positions
in telecommunications, entertainment,

896
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:04,272
publishing and advertising.

897
00:52:04,272 --> 00:52:07,623
- [Carol Jenkins] That means that 97%
of everything you know about yourself

898
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:10,688
and about your country and your world,
comes from the male perspective.

899
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:13,547
It doesn't mean that it's wrong,
it just means that in a democracy,

900
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,877
where you talk about equality
and full participation,

901
00:52:16,877 --> 00:52:19,036
you've got half of the population,

902
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:21,296
more than half of the population,
not participating.

903
00:52:21,537 --> 00:52:26,119
- [Pat Mitchell] Many years ago, I said,
"Why don't we just create our own network,

904
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:31,551
other than continuing to try and get our
stories told by other people's networks?"

905
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:36,042
So, we put together an idea.
We went to various distributors,

906
00:52:36,042 --> 00:52:39,272
including the broadcast networks,
the cable companies, etcetera,

907
00:52:39,272 --> 00:52:42,814
pitched the idea
and one person said to me,

908
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:44,832
"Well, why do we need
another women's network?

909
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:47,676
We already have one.
We have lifetime."

910
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:54,307
Meanwhile, there are
22 ESPN sports channels

911
00:52:54,662 --> 00:52:58,079
- [Martha Lauzen] There's a fairly
pervasive sense of denial

912
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,728
about the status of women working
in both television and film.

913
00:53:03,371 --> 00:53:07,507
Peter Bart wrote a column in <i>Variety</i>,
talking about the glass ceiling

914
00:53:07,547 --> 00:53:09,887
and how it no longer exists.

915
00:53:09,964 --> 00:53:13,759
<i>Putting that kind of information</i>
out there is really troublesome.

916
00:53:14,195 --> 00:53:16,593
Women comprise only 16%
of all writers, directors, producers,

917
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:20,089
cinematographers and editors.

918
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:24,840
And only 7 % of directors and
10% of writers in film are women.

919
00:53:25,138 --> 00:53:27,420
- [Lisa Ling] For so long it has been
an industry dominated

920
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,198
by men who just don't leave.

921
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,671
- [Lindy DeKoven] People who employ
other people tend to hire people

922
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:36,553
who are a reflection of themselves.

923
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,178
- [Barbara J. Berg] This impacts hiring.
It impacts the news, directors,

924
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:43,103
the journalists, the people who are
gonna cover the news,

925
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:45,087
and of course, who reports the news?

926
00:53:45,261 --> 00:53:49,785
Very much is the factor
in what kind of news is reported.

927
00:53:50,373 --> 00:53:55,046
The average number of news stories
about women and girls is less than 20%

928
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:59,931
- [Martha Lauzen] When any group
is not featured in the media,

929
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:04,552
they have to wonder, "Well,
what part do I play in this culture?"

930
00:54:04,593 --> 00:54:07,232
There's actually an
academic term for that.

931
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:09,678
It's called, symbolic annihilation.

932
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:16,528
[nuclear explosion]

933
00:54:26,357 --> 00:54:31,222
- [Geena Davis] All of Hollywood
is run on one assumption

934
00:54:31,222 --> 00:54:36,391
that women will watch stories about men,
but men won't watch stories about women.

935
00:54:37,082 --> 00:54:45,506
And all the decisions are made
based on this concrete fact

936
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:49,307
and nobody's ever really proved
that that's true.

937
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:52,476
I think it's a horrible indictment
of our society, if we assume

938
00:54:52,476 --> 00:54:57,394
that one half of the population
is just not interested in the other half.

939
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,796
- [Catherine Hardwicke] The first couple
of scripts that I wrote, of course,

940
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:06,053
had a female, you know, as a lead
character and people will look,

941
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,845
"Well, there's hardly
any bankable actresses."

942
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:12,786
So, they can't carry a film.
So, it has to be super low budget

943
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:16,619
or we wouldn't bankroll it and no one's
gonna show up in the theaters

944
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:22,401
and I finally wrote the lowest
budget movie I could ever write.

945
00:55:22,468 --> 00:55:25,757
I co-wrote <i>Thirteen</i>
with a 13-year old girl

946
00:55:25,942 --> 00:55:28,723
<i>and it was about people</i>
of lower income.

947
00:55:28,723 --> 00:55:30,911
<i>They could wear my clothes.</i>
We could shoot in my house.

948
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:34,161
<i>We could use my car.</i>
We made the movie and it went on

949
00:55:34,161 --> 00:55:38,119
<i>to Sundance and it went on to win awards</i>
and get international distribution

950
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:41,598
<i>and I think it was the same</i> Twilight.
like, with

951
00:55:41,815 --> 00:55:46,765
<i>Two major studios turned it down.</i>
Finally, a new upstart company showed me

952
00:55:46,765 --> 00:55:50,968
<i>the project and it turned into</i>
obviously, a phenomenon making

953
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:55,036
<i>over half a billion dollars so far.</i>
So, it is proved the theory

954
00:55:55,036 --> 00:55:58,349
<i>that girls and women</i>
wouldn't go to see a movie,

955
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:02,355
but they did go see the movie in droves.
And over and over and over.

956
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:05,272
And bought the DVD
and even bought pillowcases.

957
00:56:06,986 --> 00:56:10,577
But there is a flip side to that,
which is kind of astonishing to me.

958
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:14,211
On the next two <i>Twilight,</i>
they've hired guys.

959
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:17,990
<i>They did not seek out a female director</i>
and on the same side,

960
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:22,964
I've gone after some jobs that I've been
told flat out to myself and my agent,

961
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:25,807
"Oh no, we think a guy
should direct this."

962
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:28,737
<i>And to me, I think,</i>
"Okay, can a man direct, you know,

963
00:56:28,737 --> 00:56:30,651
Sex and the City, Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants,

964
00:56:30,651 --> 00:56:34,536
<i>the </i>Miley Cyrus<i> movie?"</i>
Nobody ever questions that.

965
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:38,571
But I, a very successful female
director, cannot direct a movie

966
00:56:38,571 --> 00:56:40,325
that should be done by a man.

967
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:42,102
- [Jennifer Todd] But nobody says,
"I'm not gonna hire a female director."

968
00:56:42,102 --> 00:56:46,181
On their list, there's just 25 names
and none of them are women.

969
00:56:46,181 --> 00:56:49,547
- [Paul Haggis] What happens is,
these studio chiefs who--

970
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:53,564
or people like myself, you know,
writer, producers or directors,

971
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,506
we see the world in a certain way

972
00:56:57,557 --> 00:57:02,208
and we don't really challenge that often
and so we just replicate the world

973
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:08,315
that we grew up in without
really asking why we're doing it.

974
00:57:08,777 --> 00:57:11,341
- [Martha Lauzen] What is the first thing
that they tell people when they're,

975
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:14,423
you know, in a screen writing class?
Create what you know.

976
00:57:14,602 --> 00:57:16,728
<i>When you have greater diversity</i>
behind the scenes,

977
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:20,224
not only do you get more
female characters on screen,

978
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,637
<i>but you get a different kind</i>
of female character.

979
00:57:22,834 --> 00:57:26,601
<i>You get a more powerful and</i>
multi dimensional female character.

980

<i>- [Rosario Dawson] That's why it's</i>
extremely important for women

983
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,951
<i>to be writing their own stories.</i>
Truly crafting those stories,

984
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:42,147
writing them down, directing them,
and giving them to people

985
00:57:42,147 --> 00:57:47,623
to really emotionally become impacted by
because when my mom tells me a story

986
00:57:47,623 --> 00:57:48,733
or my grandmother tells me a story,
I'm riveted.

987
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:50,859
[women laughing]

988
00:57:50,859 --> 00:57:54,512
- [Geena Davis] None of us had any idea
what the response was gonna be

989
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,985
to <i>Thelma and Louise.</i>
One time I was at a red light

990
00:57:57,493 --> 00:58:00,207
and I heard this honking
and I looked next to me, and it's

991
00:58:00,222 --> 00:58:03,466
a car full of women who are
popping out of all the windows

992
00:58:03,466 --> 00:58:06,849
and the sunroof and going,
"Whoo-hoo!"

993
00:58:06,899 --> 00:58:10,080
[laughs] I'm like,
"Well this is certainly never been

994
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,178
a reaction to my any of my other movies."

995
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:18,956
Then the very next movie I made was
<i>A League of Their Own</i>, where I had

996
00:58:18,956 --> 00:58:23,299
13 or 15 year old girls coming up to me
with the same kind of reactions,

997
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,377
"Oh my God. You have no idea
that movie changed my life.

998
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,638
I played sports
because of that movie."

999
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:34,036
And it really struck me how few
opportunities we give women to have

1000
00:58:34,036 --> 00:58:36,362
that kind of experience
watching a movie.

- [Katie Couric] The media can be
an instrument of change.

1002
00:58:40,673 --> 00:58:45,618
It can maintain the <i>status quo</i>
and reflect the views of the society.

1003
00:58:46,006 --> 00:58:51,095
Or it can hopefully awaken people
and change minds.

1004
00:58:51,938 --> 00:58:55,239

01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:07,077
<i>We needed a huge media campaign</i>
to get these women back into the home.

1023
01:00:07,077 --> 01:00:10,120
1947 <i>Newsweek</i> prints, "For the American
girl, books and babies don't mix."

1024
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:11,779
Bestselling <i>Modern Woman</i> states,

1025
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:13,577
"An independent woman
is a contradiction in terms."

1026
01:00:13,654 --> 01:00:16,763
<i>One of the most effective ways to do this</i>
was through television.

1027
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:19,400
So, the television was part
of the re-domestication.

1028
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,229
1948 1 million homes in the U.S.
have TV sets

1029
01:00:22,229 --> 01:00:23,981
1948 <i>Father Knows Best</i>

1030
01:00:25,686 --> 01:00:29,887
<i>We had television shows sponsored</i>
by numerous commodities.

1031
01:00:30,036 --> 01:00:33,467
<i>The gleaming appliances that</i>
June Cleaver would use in the kitchen.

1032
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,728
<i>These commodities were being</i>
linked to the good life.

1033
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:41,427
<i>Women rush to their new shopping centers</i>
in their brand new cars and loaded up.

1034
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:44,884
<i>They didn't realize that they were</i>
actually doing this in the service of

1035
01:00:44,884 --> 01:00:47,198
<i>the strong governmental imperative.</i>

1036
01:00:47,505 --> 01:00:51,010
<i>The notion of the commodity boom</i>
was linked to Capitalism,

1037
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:55,164
<i>which our government was supporting.</i>
These evade the threat of Communism.

1038
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:58,350
1959 CBS becomes the largest
advertising medium in the world

1039
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:01,946
So, you really see the linkage
of advertising on TV,

1040
01:01:02,078 --> 01:01:06,365
the pushing of Capitalism, and then
our government pushing Capitalism to it.

of this media machine?

1073
01:02:26,737 --> 01:02:31,005

social order of America at that time.

1075

"The feminist agenda is not about
equal rights for women. It is about

political movement

or stop the progress.

1089
01:03:23,718 --> 01:03:26,275
And so it's a constant tension
between trying to move forward

that marketers have dictated
our cultural norms and values.

1168
01:07:45,577 --> 01:07:48,759
And this is made possible by
the relaxation of rules on advertising

Women watch television so the advertisers

they felt that they had a very major

It's actually enforced by the
Federal Communications Commission,

Period. End of story.

Today, it is the wild, wild west.
It is a free-for-all.

2007 The FCC unanimously recommends
Congress regulate TV violence

2007 Congress holds special hearing

2009 Studies prove exposure to sexually
implicit video games and music videos

it's an American issue

- [Malkia Amala Cyril]
Without a media sense,

1246

when that's publicly accountable,

1247
01:11:43,368 --> 01:11:46,682
what you have is not only
widespread content bias,

1248

inaccessible public conversation.

- [Jim Steyer] For years,
the media industry

1250
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:55,992
hid behind the label of censorship.

1251
01:11:56,194 --> 01:11:59,064
<i>It's not censorship to say</i>
to a media company

1252
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:02,842
that's producing an image or a website
that's really offensive

1253
01:12:02,842 --> 01:12:05,628
and really inappropriate.
That's the essence of free speech.

1254
01:12:05,832 --> 01:12:10,163
But in a world of a million channels
like we have today, people try to do

1255
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:12,926
more shocking and shocking things
to break through the clutter.

1256

<i>And often times, they resort</i>
to violent images

or sexually offensive images
or demeaning images,

1258
01:12:18,107 --> 01:12:19,942
'cause they know it'll get attention.

1259
01:12:20,138 --> 01:12:24,482
The problem is, kids are exposed to that

having this conversation with a woman

1309
01:15:57,787 --> 01:16:00,872
far wiser than me
and stories to talk about,

1310
01:16:00,872 --> 01:16:05,003
"Oh, how bad it is for women in America,"
and she just looked at me

1311
01:16:05,003 --> 01:16:06,657
and listened to me
for a while and she said,

1312
01:16:06,657 --> 01:16:07,692
"Well, I have to tell you, Cory,

1313
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:09,851
I actually think it's really bad
for men in America."

1314
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:11,608
And I go, "What do you mean?"
She started talking to me

1315
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:15,461
and really putting the spotlight on me
and talking about how emotionally

1316
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:17,459
constipated men are taught
to be very early on,

1317
01:16:18,689 --> 01:16:23,494
how we don't have-- haven't learned
how to express ourselves in healthy ways,

1318
01:16:23,494 --> 01:16:28,364
it often does manifest itself in such
awful and violent ways.

1319
01:16:28,509 --> 01:16:32,452
But she talked about a spiritual healing
that was needed for guys.

1320
01:16:43,636 --> 01:16:45,320
- <i>[Jennifer] I've been trying to imagine</i>

1321
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,967
<i>a better world for my</i>
daughter's generation.

1322
01:16:49,078 --> 01:16:51,242
<i>And I'm beginning to get some ideas.</i>

1323
01:16:51,869 --> 01:16:53,843
"The numbers of women
in leadership positions

1324
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:56,508
in our country are still very low."

1325
01:16:57,288 --> 01:16:59,963
<i>We have to find a way</i>
to change this culture.

1326
01:17:00,892 --> 01:17:03,560
We need to shift our focus
from the bottom line

1327
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:07,263
<i>to one of social responsibility.</i>
We need to challenge

1328
01:17:07,263 --> 01:17:09,691
<i>the media conglomerates</i>
to value women

1329
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,947
<i>for more than their youth,</i>
beauty and sexuality.

1330
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:15,889
<i>And we must hold</i>
these companies accountable.

1331
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:18,283
<i>We need to encourage women </i>

1332
01:17:18,283 --> 01:17:21,611
<i>to discover their true power,</i>
so they can become leaders.

1333
01:17:22,127 --> 01:17:23,872
<i>And we must support them</i>
on their journey.

1334
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:28,100
70% of women in the workforce
are mothers

1335
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:32,357
yet we have no national paid family
leave, childcare or flex time policy

1336
01:17:32,434 --> 01:17:37,307
<i>And ultimately, we need to live our</i>
own vision of what a woman can be.

1337
01:17:37,398 --> 01:17:40,904
Be the change you want
to see in the world.

- Mahatma Gandhi

1339
01:17:44,324 --> 01:17:47,635
- [Condoleezza Rice] We make a mistake
when we say, you have to find

1340
01:17:47,635 --> 01:17:49,635
role models who look like you.

1341
01:17:50,556 --> 01:17:55,403
If Sally Ride, my dear friend,
first female astronaut had been waiting

1342
01:17:55,403 --> 01:18:00,086
for a female astronaut role model,
she would never have done it.

1343
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:03,744
And so, I'm a big believer
in finding your role models

1344
01:18:03,744 --> 01:18:05,481
wherever you can find them.

1345
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:08,801
In people who inspire and
stimulate you for whatever reason.

1346
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:10,872
- [Jan Yanehiro] Growing up,
there was nobody

1347
01:18:10,872 --> 01:18:12,509
who looked like me on television,

1348
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:15,503
so I never dreamed
that I could be on television.

1349
01:18:15,644 --> 01:18:20,233
I would love to say, "Yeah, there were
some great women role models back then."

1350
01:18:20,233 --> 01:18:22,311
Actually, there were none.

1351
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:27,585
Years later, Connie Chung went
on television to report in Watergate,

1352
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,272
and I would say to her,
"Connie, you're my role model."

1353
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:32,601
She would say to me,
"Jan, but I'm not that old."

1354
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,131
And I say, "Yeah, you're a year
older than I am, Connie

1355
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:36,486
and that's good enough for me."

1356
01:18:36,777 --> 01:18:39,426
- [Katie Couric] In terms of my
role models in television news,

01:18:39,452 --> 01:18:41,812
of course, Barbara Walters,
Lesley Stahl,

1358
01:18:41,812 --> 01:18:44,350
and believe it or not,
Mary Tyler Moore.

1359
01:18:44,482 --> 01:18:47,828
<i>I grew up watching that show</i>
and the notion of a woman

1360
01:18:47,828 --> 01:18:51,610
making it on her own
and working at that TV station,

1361
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:54,435
I think was, very, very influential.

1362
01:18:54,839 --> 01:18:56,134
- [Rachel Maddow] One of the things
that really surprised me

1363
01:18:56,134 --> 01:19:00,870
was the number of women
in positions of power in television

1364
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:02,335
who reached out to me and said,

1365
01:19:02,335 --> 01:19:04,717
"Can I take you out to breakfast?"
"Can I take you out to lunch?"

1366
01:19:04,717 --> 01:19:07,067
"Can I make sure that you have
my phone number or my email address,

1367
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:11,912
so that if anything comes up--" and
it definitely wasn't like a gender mafia

1368
01:19:11,912 --> 01:19:15,971
going on in the media,
but there was an over effort

1369
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:20,797
to both welcome me and make me know
that women who had gone before me,

1370
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:23,674
who had fought to get where they were,
were both happy that I was there

1371
01:19:23,674 --> 01:19:25,460
and wanted to be resources to me.

1372
01:19:25,663 --> 01:19:28,322
And there's an expectation that
I will be a resource to other women.

<i>- [Jennifer] When women mentor each other,</i>

from <i>Fortune's</i> most powerful women

One hour of reality TV can be fun.

and not to support the

A consumer's voice is maybe

An older white male.

They're gonna look like a woman and

Oh, she's smiling.

1440
01:23:15,606 --> 01:23:20,878
On September 18th 2009,
I began my journey into motherhood.

1441
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:24,622
My husband and I have the same wishes

1442
01:23:24,622 --> 01:23:27,857
for Montana that any parents
have for their child.

1443
01:23:28,594 --> 01:23:32,129
We want her to pursue her purpose
and passions in life

1444
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:35,076
and to understand
that what's really important

1445
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,711
is who she is on the inside.

1446
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:41,679
And it's critical to us
that all girls grow up in a world

1447
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,802
where their voice counts,

1448
01:23:43,933 --> 01:23:47,294
where our culture embraces them
in all of their diversity

1449
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:50,786
and where they're afforded
equal opportunities to succeed in life.

1450
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:55,773
I keep coming back to my early years.

1451
01:23:56,602 --> 01:24:00,907
Too often, we girls and women
don't recognize our own internal strength.

1452
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:08,921
I now know that we can't let anyone
or anything take our power away from us.

1453
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,177
What do you think, Montana?

1454
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:18,111
Are you ready?

1455
01:24:20,953 --> 01:24:24,900
Join the Movement

1456
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:27,747
- If we really want things
to change around you,

1457
01:24:27,747 --> 01:24:29,655
here's what you can do.

1459
01:24:33,411 --> 01:24:36,160
- Measure yourself by accomplishments
and not by how you look.

1460
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,746
- If you and I, every time
we pass a mirror,

1461
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:42,270
downgrade on how we look,
or complain about our looks,

1462
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:46,759
if we remember that a girl is watching us,
and that's what she's learning.

1463
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,648
- Reflect on the ways you
may contribute to sexism.

1464
01:24:49,848 --> 01:24:53,596
- I include myself in this.
We scrutinize the women.

1465
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:56,223
"God, look how old she's gotten,
look how gray she's gotten.

1466
01:24:56,223 --> 01:24:57,482
What is she wearing?"

1467
01:24:57,695 --> 01:25:01,259
I think that as women, we need to stop
that destructive behavior

1468
01:25:01,259 --> 01:25:05,389
that we inflict upon each other
and ultimately onto ourselves.

1469
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:08,529
- Support media that champions
accomplished women.

1470
01:25:09,043 --> 01:25:13,530
- We need strong women role models who
in the media because they did something,

1471
01:25:13,687 --> 01:25:16,004
because they're doing great work,
not because they have

1472
01:25:16,004 --> 01:25:20,142
the most bangin' body
and they're sexiest woman of 2010.

1473
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:22,027
They're the best philanthropists.

1474
01:25:22,064 --> 01:25:25,467
They're the best in the medical field
and it's not about the way they look,

1475
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:27,462
it's about who they are inside.

1476
01:25:28,521 --> 01:25:32,543
- Boycott magazines, TV shows and movies
that objectify and degrade women.

1477
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:36,545
- Speaking your mind and criticizing
media companies when you think

1478
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:38,639
they're doing things that are
inappropriate at your children,

1479
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,810
is not just your God-given right
as an American, as a parent,

1480
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:45,828
but it's also entirely consistent
with the First Amendment.

1481
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,925
- Go see movies written
and directed by women.

1482
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:53,883
- And it's important to go on opening
weekend and Friday is best

1483
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:57,106
because these are the numbers
that Hollywood tracks.

1484
01:25:57,526 --> 01:26:00,260
- Write your own stories
and create your own media

1485
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:03,205
about powerful women
in non-traditional roles.

1486
01:26:03,568 --> 01:26:05,758
- My daughter, when she was nine,
she wrote this little screenplay

1487
01:26:05,758 --> 01:26:07,995
and she shot a movie you know,
with our little video camera,

1488
01:26:07,995 --> 01:26:11,512
with her you know, casting her friends
and it was just so much fun for her

1489
01:26:11,512 --> 01:26:14,674
and it teaches them that the media
are a construction.

1490
01:26:14,827 --> 01:26:15,937
And they start to understand

1491
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,983
that these are stories that people
are telling them and they can come up

1492
01:26:17,983 --> 01:26:20,706
with their own stories to tell back
and very often, they can be you know,

1493
01:26:20,706 --> 01:26:22,732
subversive stories, resistant stories.

1494
01:26:23,007 --> 01:26:25,936
- Teach those around you
to look at the media critically.

1495
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:31,128
- Well, one thing that I do with my kids,
is I watch these shows with them,

1496
01:26:31,128 --> 01:26:35,104
I say, "Hey, did you notice
there's only one female in that group?"

1497
01:26:35,172 --> 01:26:39,427
and, "What if that character
had been a girl, instead?"

1498
01:26:39,503 --> 01:26:43,560
and, "Why is she wearing that when
she's trying to rescue somebody?"

1499
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:47,256
- Ask your school to start
a media literacy course

1500
01:26:47,256 --> 01:26:49,074
focused on gender issues.

1501
01:26:49,429 --> 01:26:53,884
- We need media literacy as much I think,
as we need to learn to read.

1502
01:26:54,023 --> 01:26:57,506
Our responses should be, "Whose
perspectives are framing this story?"

1503
01:26:57,744 --> 01:27:00,630
"There are always more than
two sides to every story."

1504
01:27:00,993 --> 01:27:03,012
"Are we being sold here?"

1505
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:05,110
- Don't be afraid
to challenge your friends

1506
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:08,031
if you hear them saying
derogatory things about women.

1507
01:27:08,243 --> 01:27:12,638
- King said it very eloquently, "The
problem today is not the vitriolic words

1508
01:27:12,638 --> 01:27:14,542
and the evil actions
and the bad people,

1509
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:17,834
it's the appalling silencing
and inaction of the good people."

1510
01:27:18,031 --> 01:27:21,052
- Find healthy role models
and be a mentor to others.

1511
01:27:21,744 --> 01:27:25,419
- Encourage women to become leaders
- and support them in the process.

1512
01:27:25,771 --> 01:27:29,799
- If we see women who we think
would be excellent at any political job,

1513
01:27:29,799 --> 01:27:32,872
whether it's dog catchers,
school board member,

1514
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:36,845
or member of Congress,
we need to make that known.

1515
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,812
- "Whatever women do, they must do
twice as well as a man

1516
01:27:40,812 --> 01:27:43,507
to be thought of as half as good.

1517
01:27:43,699 --> 01:27:46,569
Luckily, that's not too difficult."

1518
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:51,102
Miss Representation
would not be possible

1519
01:27:51,102 --> 01:27:53,514
if one woman had not
initially believed in another.

1520
01:27:53,806 --> 01:27:57,321
Thank you Regina for your trust
in me and our team.

1521
01:27:57,977 --> 01:28:02,962
May we all make empowering
other women and girls a priority.
