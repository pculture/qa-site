      <p begin="01:25:42.119" end="01:25:45.102">The fact of the matter is that <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>if only I change</p>
      <p begin="01:25:45.102" end="01:25:46.813">it's not gonna make a difference.</p>

      <p begin="01:25:53.989" end="01:25:58.655">So, I believe the most radical, <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>political act there is, is to be an optimist.</p>

      <p begin="01:26:03.093" end="01:26:07.972">The reason why I am here is <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>because a first grader called Olive,</p>

      <p begin="01:26:25.842" end="01:26:28.755">Part of the reason for that<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>is because there is community.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:28.755" end="01:26:33.366">I believe very strongly that a lot of the<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>environmental problems in our planet</p>

      <p begin="01:26:35.872" end="01:26:36.957">Because without community, <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></p>
