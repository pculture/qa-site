[B.Z. Goldberg] Growing up here
in Jerusalem,

00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:31,248
I think I had a pretty normal childhood.

4
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:35,314
But normal in the Middle East 
is always intertwined with war.

Fighting breaks out,
bombs blow up, people are killed.

00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:44,733
When the peace talks began,
I came back to Jerusalem.

00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:48,349
My name is B.Z. What's your name?
- Mecideh

8
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,512
I knew the children here
had something to say

9
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:55,878
and no one was asking them 
what they thought of the conflict

00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,713

15
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:31,533
They live no more than 20 minutes
from each other,

16
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:34,690

in very separate worlds.

the same clothes as me?

00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,867

There were lots of terrorist attacks
on the number 18 bus.

27
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:46,238
People avoid the number 18, which is
dumb 'cause if I take the number 22

28
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:52,032
which is supposed to be a safe line,
I could still blow up.

When I get on I'm anxious, 
so I look for suspicious people.

If I see a really scary person,
I watch him.

I keep waiting for the explosion

When we're downtown - 
most of the explosion are downtown.

33
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:30,530
So I can't wait to get past the downtown area, I count the seconds-

It could happen anywhere!

She's afraid it will make me

The Jews say this is their land.

00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:38,485
How could it be their land?

56
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:48,355
If it is their land, why does Koran
say that the Prophet, Mohammed--

57
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:52,142
flew from theMecca to the
Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

58

So, Jerusalem belongs to us!
To the Arabs!

- Flomo is the son of a well-respected Rabii
from the United States.

00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:11,836
He was born here in the Jewish quarter.

61
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:15,776
- I live in the city in the Jerusalem,
an old city that I hear the church bells,

00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:18,895
Arabs and I hear the Jews praying.

63
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:22,194
So, it would really bother me very much
if I wouldn't live here

64
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,876
and I wouldn't get used to it.

65
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:28,341
Because I got used to it,
it's like part of hearing the trees shaking.

66
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:31,131
It also makes me feel very safe here,
because I know

67
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:35,920
Saddam Hussain is bombing.
He would never bomb the old city of Jerusalem,

68
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,683

So, first you have to learn.

00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:33,605
I start studying at seven-thirty and then we finished at seven-thirty everynight.

73
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:36,418
No one says that you have to do this,
while you are studying

74
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:39,200
But it says in the Gumorah,
the people of Israel, who keep the Torah

They're like a candle, that it always moves.

who is not religious,

do you feel like it's your personal job
to bring me closer to Judaism?

78
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:02,638
- Some people have to bring others closer,

79
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:05,392
some people have to bring their selves closer

80
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:08,650
And some people just have 
to sit and learn.

81
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,339
Then, do what God tells them.

Each person has his own qualities.

Each person really can't do this
with the reason to do something.

In 1967, Israel conquered

We're from Zakarieh. The Jews kicked
us off our land and put us in this camp.

This camp used to be just tents.

In our family, we each have our own bed.

from here, I had never visited Beit-El

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or any other settlement before.

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
God promised us the land of Israel.

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Arabs came and took it!

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I am surrounded by Arabs.

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll talk about it later.

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the book of Genesis it says,
"Rise and walk the land."

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Who is God speaking to?

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Abraham, our forefather.

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If Abraham didn't exist, me and
him and him wouldn't exist.

Even you wouldn't exist.

167

Moishe, what will you be
when you grow up?

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll try to be an army commander...

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then I'll try to become
the Commander in Chief.

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I succeed maybe I'll be the
first religious Commander in Chief.

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want Barak to make a coalition
with the settler's party.

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the perfect combination,
but it will never work out.

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My name is Mosihe Bar Am.
I live in Beit-El.

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a settlement, a place where
people who fight with Arabs live.

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We fight because this land is ours.

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I could make my own future,
all the Arabs would fly away.

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Jews would stay
and the Temple would be rebuilt.

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This fence separates us
from that Arab village.

179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Beit-el is surrounded by Arabs.
If the Arabs break in,

180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there's nothing we can do.
We're surrounded. We can't escape.

181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we have oru family army to protect us.
We have our firing range.

182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if the soldiers aim poorly, it's okay
because they might shoot an Arab!

183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999


184

- Because it's not modest.

Resting on Shabbat is 
a "mitzva" (a commandment).

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We cover the bread so it doesn't
see that we drink the wine first.

192
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's forbidden to rip toilet paper
on Shabbat.

193
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, I am pre-ripping it.

194
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
On Shabbat it's forbidden
to touch money.

It's forbidden to brush hair in case,
there are knots to work through.

- Whta's your name?
- Faraj Adnan.

474
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Where do you live? Deheishe refugee camp.

475

Where are you from originally? Ras Abu Ammar.

476
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My dream is to return to my land.

477
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I can't return, then I'll give the key to my children and grandchildren.

478
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just as my grandparents gave it to me.

480
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Freedom!

481
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Good. Do you like freedom?

482
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes.

483
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Do the children of Palestine live in freedom?

484
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
No.

485
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Can someone draw a picture that shows how you feel?

486
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Are you free like the deer? Or is something obstructing your freedom?

487
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Like the people who are prevented from going to pray in Jerusalem.

This is a child holding a stone saying, "I will kill them."

"May God curse them."

491

These children are going to Jerusalem.

492
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But the soldiers won't allow them across the checkpoint.

493
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is Jerusalem, the chiuldren and this is the barricade.

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Who does Jerusalem belong to?

496
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Palestinians.

497

The Palestinian People!

501
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Palestinians are pushing it! They want Jerusalem as their capital.

502
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They can keep wanting!

503
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Jerusalem is 10 minutes from Deheishe camp.

504
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I've never been to Jerusalem.

505
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd like to visit our capital and pray there.

506
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
See Jerusalem and the Dome of the Rock to see what's inside it.

507
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Of course I haven't visited it because they don't let us in.

508
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have to really think about it and have the whole world discuss it.

509
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The smartest people in the world should decide about Jerusalem.

510
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd never return Jerusalem. God forbid-

511
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd clear out the Arabs from the Mount of Olives and all Jerusalem.

512
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Until the 1967 war, Jerusalem was a divided city.

513
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
West Jerusalem was Israeli and east Jerusalem, including the old city,

514
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
was in Jordanian hands. Jews did not have access to their holy sites.

515
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When Israel conquered the West Bank, all of Jerusalem came under Israeli rule.

the city's reunification.

519
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In recent years,the settlers' movement has organized a Jerusalem Day parade

520
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999

Masmud and his family are Jerusalem Arabs.

Unlike the kids who live in the refugee camp, Masmud doesn't need a permit

524
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to cross the check point. And he can move freely around the city.

They say today is the celebration of the reunification of Jerusalem.

528
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But Jerusalem isn't for the Jews. It's for Arabs. This is just a provocation.

529
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Jews act like they own this land.

How would you feel?

They kill women and children but they do it for their country.

535
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The more Jews we kill, the fewer there will be.

Exactly on Wednesday. At about five o'clock-

He died. Murdered. On the spot.

541

My friend told me how it happened-

542
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is Ephraim's car and this is the terrorist's car.

543

And Ita, his mom died in the hospital.

548
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's hard to accept. I met him at the "mikva" (ritual bath) every week.

549
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The last time we met I said "See you next week."

And I have a proof.

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
On the grave it says, "God will avenge his blood."

560

They only write that for murder.

561
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When you place a stone, it's like you're identifying with the grave.

562

Actually, Ephraim is doing OK in heaven.

Still if I could have one wish, I'd ask God to send the Messiah-

Especially those murdered by terrorists.

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When I see them being killed, I asked myself-

569
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Why? It's so stupid. It could be prevented.

570

In war both sides suffer. Maybe there's a "winner" but what's a winner?

Kids, for example, I could be walking down the street and hear an Arab cursing me.

625
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sometimes, he could like curse back and then, he'll hurt you.

626
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Some kids like will tear you apart
and beat you up until you're bleeding.

627
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And some kids will just like hunt you,
finished punching you and go.

628
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I never got into like being a friend to an Arab but like, I did get into like

629
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
saying hi in the streets or stuffs like that.

Palestinian friends?

I know them!

661
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They're mean and deceitful.
Since, the time of the Prophet Mohammed.

662
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They betrayed him in battle
and fought against him.

- Beside if I met an Arab,
my friends would call me a wimp!

664
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- When I see a Jew I want to grab a stone
and throw it at him.

665
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or at his car.
I even think of killing him.

666
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Some Arab kids might become terrorists.
Think about this.

667
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Any Jew who sees me would think I'm a terrorist.

668
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They think about their fathers and uncles
who have been killed.

669
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we both think of the same thing.

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We each think of our relatives 
who have been killed by other side

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we each want to kill each other!

a runner. Is he taller than us?

- [B.Z.] He's small for his age.

- Does he speak Hebrew?

They didn't invite us.

- You're so silly!

- I don't want them to come here.

690
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Even if he understands me,
when he grows up he'll

691
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
take his father's side against me,
otherwise, his father would kill him.

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He'd rather displaced us
than join us and be displaced.

- You're dogmatic. You have to understand
their thinking then, respond.

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Of course I'm dogmatic! What do you
expect after all we've been through?

695
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Maybe, he'll understand you. When he grows up he might come to help you.

- Maybe he'll be displaced

of what we went through!

and you want to make friends

- Their father might have.

702

No?

- You're also half American
not just Israeli.

I was talking about authentic Jews.

Not Americans.
Not mixed.

- Okay! My brother is an authentic Jew
and I'm an authentic Jew too!

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- He's an authentic Jew?

717
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- I'm sure we'll never return to our villages.
I'm absolutely positive.

718
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We will never have our homeland.

719

I just want on thing; remove the borders.
Take away the checkpoints.

We want to live with them!

and they refuse to meet us...

722
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there will never be peace
between us and the Jews.

Nor between two countries.

724

We Arabs are killing each other
because of them.

And you want me to become friends
with them?

Neither adults nor kids!

- The children will grow up!

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They might feel with us!

729
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- They won't feel.

730
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- No Palestinan child ever tried to explain
our situaton to the Jews.

731
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999

Those twins...
Do they want to come here?

- What do you say?

750
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999

- That we have to think about it.

752
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999

758
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999

I said you weren't coming.

759
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Look, I trust B.Z. and the crew
and the people who invited you.

760
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But the final responsibility is ours.

761
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Somthing could happen.
- So?

762
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- There could be a curfew.
I'd feel safer if you were going to Paris.

It's the territories and the army.
This is not a walk to the grocery store.

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- They need it to be their day
and I respect that.

766
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- We have our own needs.

767
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Our needs are our fears.
Let's face it!

Is the Hamas there?

769
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- There are Hamas-niks everywhere
- Will it be dangerous?

770
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- No. If it was dangerous,
I wouldn't let you go.

771
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you're guests, don't forget.

772
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a checkpoint.
- Mom, we know what a checkpoint is.

773

- Look, Arabs waiting to be searched.

774
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- It's not fair! It's their land.
Why do they have to be searched?

775
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- It's their land but we don't want
to blow up. It's complicated.

776
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Look, a cop, a cop,
a Palestinian cop!

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So mom, it's real close huh?

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Hi!

781
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Hi!

782
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Daniel?

783
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Yarko!

784
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Welcome to Deheishe Camp.

785
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- You're running with this?
- No, ...

786
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- No, but the shoes....

787
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Yeah!
- Yes?

788
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Yeah!

789
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
During the Intifada, this was the center
of the clashes.

790
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These are bullet holes.
Many people were martyred here.

791
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Boys threw stones and the soldiers
would shoot at them.

792
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- and he's dead here?

793
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Real bulets or rubber bullets?

794
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Real ones.

795
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Real ones?

796
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Look, don't speak Israeli (Hebrew)
here in the camp Deheishe.

797
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because the Arabs don't like anything.

798
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Don't like Israeli people?
- Yeah!

799
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Here?
- Yeah!

800
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Victory is ours"

801
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The land's thirst will be quenched
with blood. - Hamas

802
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- I'm Daniel.
- Here, here.

803
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Hello!

805
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Okay, the translators are here.

806
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- How do you feel after our day together?

807
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- I used to think that anyone 
who liked the Hamas was totally insane.

808
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Some of the kids here like the Hamas
and now I can understand why.

809
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The graffiti might make me uncomfortable
but I can understand it.

810
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I were them,
I'd feel the same way.

811
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- [Faraj] I feel torn inside.

812
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
$ Part of me wants to connect with you
and part doesn't.

813
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Just like all Palestinians
aren't Hamas-niks.

814
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Not all Israelis kill Arabs.

815
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- [B.Z.] Motassim, why are you crying?

816
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- I remember how they killed my brother.

817
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He went to herd the sheep...
Let Ahmed tell the story.

818
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- He went to herd the sheep on the mountain 
with his friends.

819
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They saw people throwing stones
and went to join them.

820
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A soldier stood on a jeep
and shot him with one bullet.

821
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- They shot him?

822
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- With just one bullet, Bassam was gone
and everything was gone.

823
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For the first time, 
I felt that this other nation here...

824
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who hate us and don't want us here.

825
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Both sides have to deal with it.

826
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Israelis are also killed.
We've also lost people.

827
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- It's not one-sided.
On TV we see pictures of people killed by the Hamas.

828
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- What prevents us from knowing
one another is the checkpoints.

829
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Jews prevent us so we can't visit
each other whenever we want.

830
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- [B.Z.] Faraj, what's up?

831
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- This afternoon, I started thinking
that B.Z. will leave soon.

832
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And now we've become friends
with Daniel and Yarko.

833
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they will forget our friendship
as soon as B.Z. leaves.

834
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And all our effort will be in vain.

835
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I feel the world has changed
for the worse.

836
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's no peace.
There are wars and catastrophes.

837
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
One can't begin to imagine his future
or solve his problems.

838
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
One's plan for the future 
may never happen.

839
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because the life we live doesn't allow us
to accomplish our dreams.

840
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- It wans't easy to meet,
with all the checkpoints and stuff.

841
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Faraj called us a lot.

842
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Mostly, we didn't return his calls.
Well, at the beginning we did.

843
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He didn't understand.
He thought it was so simple to meet.

844
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He said, "I'll come to you,
I'll cross the checkpoint."

845
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it was more complicated.

846
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- I would like to meet 
more Jewish people and children.

847
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because many of them are innocent.
Even some of the adults.

848
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They didn't all encourage the occupation
of our land.

849
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd like to meet them because
if we increase our interactions,

850
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
our respect for one another
will grow.

851
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- There is no chance of peace without
meetings between Jews and Arabs.

852
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But I am not the one 
who will meet Arabs

853
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and do those things.

854
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That needs to be done 
by people who are...

855
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in their thirties or older.
Ministers and Members of Parliament.

856
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They need to meet Arabs and to start to do
something about the issue.

857
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- Peace between you and me is impossible
unless we get to know each other.

858
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Our fathers are at war and if I don't know you, I can't have peace with you.

859
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Also, you must return what you have taken away from me.

860
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The land must be returned. You can stay here, but as a guest.

861
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I wouldn't really have any interest in that. In like meeting Arab kids

862
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and speaking to them about all kind of stuff but I would like to be nice, you know,

863
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that no fights and all kinds of stuff would be happening around.

864
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Not really like close friendship but at least like kind of a small "peace process."

865
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm more concerned with my own problems.

866
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the movie, you asked me to respond to questions as an Israeli.

867
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But I have my own concerns. Like friends and volleyball, and-

868
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want there to be peace here. I really do.

869
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I just don't deal with it day to day.
