00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,688
who had a wife that she was very crazy about.

328
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,802
Otherwise, she probably never would have gone to New York.

329
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,445
[Charles] Oh, I was about the age of seven to eight years old when I was <u>.</u>

330
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,140
Our mother, when she came out, she-she told my grandmother,

331
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:20,106
"I want him to to come back and live with me."

332
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,104
My grandmother said, "No, let them stay here 'cause they are better off.

333
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:26,138
They'll get a better education if they stay down here with me."

334
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:28,062
So my mother says, "No."

335
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,392
So my grandmother said, "No, you're not taking them."

336
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,168
So, my mother stole us.

337
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,196
- They were mine.

338
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:36,881
So I figured, I got 'em. I mean, I created 'em.

339
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:41,626
So, then I'm gonna bring all my creations back to New York with me.

340
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:42,729
Mm-hm.

341
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:45,801
That's what I did.

342
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,545
- I really hate to say this, but I think, at that time it was hard to find jobs,

343
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:56,906
so there was only one way is you have some kind of dependents

344
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,561
that you can get some welfare.

345
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,034
And I feel like that's what she was doing

346
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,072
to get the welfare by having those kid there.

347
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:11,732
- During his infancy, now he was the, the favorite child.

348
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:16,663
He received all the, the-the loving and caring from his older brothers and sisters

349
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:19,357
and his grandmother and his uncles and all of us,

350
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,371
because he was the baby.

351
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:25,880
- Uh, when Charles went to New York, I think that's when he lost all of that.

352
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:32,928
- I was living with my Mom,

353
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:36,312
and I was afraid that she was gonna hurt me, so I left.

354
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:38,457
We couldn't see eye to eye.

355
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:39,997
See, I was getting blamed for everything.

356
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:41,508
So I was very bitter.

357
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,432
And it seemed like everything was rationed to us,

358
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:48,251
and I was in a basement worser than this one.

359
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:52,166
You know, it was just sand basement, it was no concrete basement.

360
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,088
Fifteen watt bulb light.

361
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:55,982
And I said "No, I can't take this."

362
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:57,752
I said, "I don't want it, I'm going."

363
00:18:57,922 --> 00:18:59,008
So I left.

364
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:04,900
[Sound of a subway train passing]

365
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,056
I was fourteen years old.

366
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:09,892
My home was the subway train.

367
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:12,574
That's where I'd go to keep warm.

368
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:17,866
I'd get on the subway train some nights, or winter nights, cold.

369
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,330
Riding the A train back up and down.

370
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:22,670
The police, pop, pop, pop, hit the darn thing real hard

371
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:24,387
and say, "Kids, you need to get off."

372
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:31,271
I'd go across the, the platform, getanother train going back. I sleep.

373
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:35,284
Get me a little corner and get astick and knock the thing real hard.

374
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:36,546
It penetrate through my head.

375
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:39,910
He said, "Kids, get up. Kids, get up."

376
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:47,370
So, I just keep going different routes toget a night's sleep before daylight come.

377
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,458
And I see for myself, what's going down, because everybody back in those days

378
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:56,817
was getting high, using the hard drugs.

379
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,766
I'd watch them holding upwhile they're shooting up

380
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,183
and they try to give it to me,

381
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:03,544
I got scared and I was afraid of needles.

382
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:05,021
I said, "No, no, no, no."

383
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,022
So that's when I headed to Jobs Corps.

384
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:10,515
And I tried to get my mother to sign me to go to Job Corps.

385
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,854
And she was mad with me, she wouldn't sign.

386
00:20:12,977 --> 00:20:15,088
So I got my sister to forge her name.

387
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,032
And, um, I learned to cook.

388
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,089
I cooked for two years.

389
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:21,961
I was a cook trainee up in Bar Harbor, Maine.

390
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:24,645
And that's when I really started doing James Brown on the Job Corps.

391
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:27,790
But they said, "Man, you see that new guy that came in?

392
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:31,156
He looks just like that guy they call, James Brown."

393
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:36,840
And they got me fired up one day, they gave me some gin.

394
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,036
In the Job Corp, you were sneaky, you were supposed to sneak it in there.

395
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:42,175
They gave me some gin, got me really high,

396
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,505
and they gave me the microphone and they say, "Sing."

397
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,821
And I went crazy.

398
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,231
So then they told me to go -- they took me to a girls' Job Corps

399
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:51,358
center to perform.

400
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:53,110
I said, "How many peoples it's gonna be?"

401
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:54,678
They said twenty or thirty peoples.

402
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,225
I said, "Okay."

403
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,096
And they called me on stage.

404
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:01,168
And I look out that stage.

405
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:03,380
And I saw all those peoples, and I froze.

406
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:04,121
I said,

407
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:08,125
"Uh-uh, I ain't going out there. Not me, not me"

408
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:13,205
So, this guy named Moody came behind me and gave me a push.

409
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:14,760
I see all the peoples was happy.

410
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:15,938
They love me.

411
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,898
They love me giving them my heart.

412
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:22,091
And I said, "Wow, this where I want to be at."

413
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,843
And I never stopped.

414
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:29,903
Our plans was when we got out of Job Corps

415
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,954
we was gonna get together and continue the music.

416
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:35,205
My band got drafted into the Vietnam War.

417
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:41,083
And, um, they went on to war and I went,completed my training at Job Corps.

422
00:21:58,097 --> 00:21:59,297
- I gotta taste that.

423
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,821
- We can open it now.

424
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,555
- A pumpkin beer. I never heard of pumpkin beer.

425

-Working with Charles Bradley, as opposed to working with

441
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:31,083
Sharon or Lee or somebody,

442
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,239
the other singers from New Yorkthat I've so often worked with,

443
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:37,143
you know, Charles has got the craziest stories.

444
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:38,983
Craziest stories.

445
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,967
So, you know as a songwriter, I just sit around with him,

446
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:45,738
and, and I hear Charles tell these stories and you're just like,

447
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:48,796
you know, we gotta write a song about that, man.

448
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:51,394
So usually before we do the vocals on the track,

449
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:55,150
[Tommy] I'll play Charles' song and just ask him if he likes it, first of all.

450
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:58,550
Then, I'll sing him my ideas, you know, to tell him how I think it should go.

451
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:02,367
And not that he disregards my ideas,but he's just got his own ideas

452
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:05,407
and he just instantly starts expressing them.

453
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:08,053
He'll just start singing, and then we'll kind of stop

454
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:10,180
and just get away from it for a second and just talk.

455
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,289
And you just start--

456
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,336
you talk with Charles long enough and a story comes out about something.

457
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:19,592
[Tommy]That without me asking him, he'll start singing about what we just-

458
00:23:19,592 --> 00:23:20,549
what we just spoke about.

459
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:24,133
And then I'll grab a pencil and paper,and let him kind of freestyle

460
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,887
over the track, over and over again.

461
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:29,070
And then we'll go back and that will become a song slowly, you know,

462
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,708
over the course of a couple of hours.

463
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:34,330
But, um, it's his stories that I'm always trying to translate into song, you know.

-[Charles] I went to California in 1977, searching for my dreams, music.

466
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:48,326
I was bouncing into different bands,

467
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:52,196
like they'll say, "Man, we'll pay you $400to do this tonight, the show tonight.

468
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:55,370
And this guy paid this, paid me to do this tonight.

469
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:57,149
That's how I was doing out there.

470
00:23:57,488 --> 00:24:01,896
And at that time, I don't know why, I got sick.

471
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:06,613
I called my Mom, and she says,"Son, come on back home."

472
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,653
Mom is getting old and then, she been through a lot.

473
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:16,686
And I, it's not for me to crucify her for what she did in her life.

474
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:21,707
So I came back to New York in '94.

475
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:26,149
I was sick as a dog, I was close to death.

476
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:29,243
They took me to Woodhull Hospital.

477
00:24:29,643 --> 00:24:33,428
[Charles] I'm allergic to penicillin and they was feeding me penicillin.

478
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,235
And my body had shut down.

479
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:40,104
I had gave up totally.

480

I didn't wanna go in because I wasn't able to go through all that snow.

don't bother coming in no more."

I got my apartment, got bills, gotta pay rent.

00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:31,885
on the side behind him. And put the siren on and pulled him aside.

Well, who's the guy next to you?

770
00:37:39,613 --> 00:37:41,410
I said, "Now that's not my information to give you,

771
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,577
you have to get that information from him."

772
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:45,780
And so he grabbed me, called me a, "Wise Nigger."

773
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:47,708
And he grabbed me and throwed me against the car,

774
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,293
put the handcuffs on me.

775
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:51,473

776
00:37:51,627 --> 00:37:53,760
When I ask you a question, don't act wise with me."

777
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:57,488
And I stayed there and then his partner came over and said, "Hey man."

778
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,940
Took him to the side, said something to him.

779
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,379
And then his partner, he kind of apologized to me.

780
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,659
Took the handcuffs off me and told me get in the car and go ahead.

781
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:07,833

789
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:33,760

That's why I don't like tocome on this block no more.

859
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:21,742
- He came downstairs and, uh, he saw me crying.

860
00:43:21,742 --> 00:43:22,997
He said, "Mom what's wrong?"

861
00:43:22,997 --> 00:43:24,892
I said, "Just go next door."

"Charles, your brother is dead."

I said, "Yes, he is."

865
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:36,160
So there was probably a whole block was

866
00:43:36,178 --> 00:43:38,250
filled with policemans with rifles and guns.

867

00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:47,037

'Cause I saw this thing says Morgue,and when it says Morgue, what I did,

and the detective wouldn't let me in there.

00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,010
I told him that's my brother and you cannot stop me.

00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:02,580
So I pushed my way in.

Sometimes I do ask God just call me home.

963
00:49:43,122 --> 00:49:47,703
Because everyday I get out and Ifight and fight to keep the honesty,

964
00:49:47,857 --> 00:49:51,311
the decency of a human being walking the planet and loving

965
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:55,135
everybody as God asks you to love everybody.

966

967
00:49:59,923 --> 00:50:05,079
How much more can one give before they find love on the planet?

968
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,281
How much more can you give?

969
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:12,191
I say, "Father, whatever the time or the hour you want me,

970

I'm ready to go."

00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,591

I wasn't looking to buy a bird,'cause when I was a kid

00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:24,446
I had me a pet chicken and that was my pet.

1019
00:53:24,676 --> 00:53:28,218
And I raised it from a little billy, from a little biddy it was yellow

1020
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,636
and he turned to be a beautiful hen.

1021
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:33,409
And he used to sleep with me and he was a beautiful hen.

1022
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:38,895
Then one day, I had him about at least two years.

at the front of the driveway lookingfor me, for me to grab him.

And I look in the oven, that was my chicken.

And I took that chicken out.

1034
00:54:10,109 --> 00:54:13,756
I dug a hole and buried him in the hole and put a cross on it.
