153

This is Bible Belt Pennsylvania.<br/>If I could only just back up.

157
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:16,261
We never really question nuclear power.<br/>That decision was made first

158
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,504
in the ’50’s or ‘60s, if we’re gonna<br/>go down this path.

159
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,438
God, I feel like I’m in a Rob Reiner movie.<br/>My dad would drive me down to the plant

160
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:29,962

You know, I believe my dad.<br/>My dad believed the industry.

00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:37,500
I just thought this was a wonderful<br/>magical technology that it comes to rescue us.

163
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,578
I mean, energy independence,<br/>security independence.

164
00:11:40,623 --> 00:11:43,928
We thought it could warm homes<br/>at a price too cheap to meter.

165
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:48,158
Everybody bet the house on atomic energy.

166
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:53,056
All of a sudden all of these things
came in to question on March 28, 1979.

167
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:02,309
- Could I have your attention please.<br/>There has been a state emergency

168
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,878
declared on Three Mile Island.

00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,109
Please stay indoors with your<br/>windows closed.

170
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:11,335
- The Metropolitan Edison Company<br/>has informed us that there has been

171
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:14,035
an incident at Three Mile Island<br/>unit number two.

172
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:16,475
Question was why we didn’t know that<br/>by the people.

173
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:20,757
The incident occurred this morning<br/>around four o’clock,

174

175
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:26,465
- It actually begun at four o’clock<br/>in the morning of March 28.

176
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:29,865
So, it a couple of days until people<br/>get a handle on what’s really happening.

177
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,462
- [ANCHORMAN] This entire situation<br/>seems bizarre, but it’s real

178
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:35,518
and it’s happening right now here in 1979--<br/>it’s really happened.

179
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:38,441
- The information parched up<br/>by the company is either inaccurate

180
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,317
or purposely misleading.

181

- Everything is under control.

00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:46,200
There is and was no danger
to public health and safety.

183
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,911
- For the industry, one of the things<br/>that occurred is they couldn’t believe

184
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:55,864
that citizens had the audacity, the temerity<br/>to call on the question their expertise.

185
00:12:56,307 --> 00:13:03,722
- I don’t why we need to--we need to<br/>tell you each and everything that, that we do.

186
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:08,079
- That’s what I remember creeping me out.<br/>Just the smugness arrogance.

187
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:12,809
- I’m here today to try and ease<br/>the level of panic and concern.

188
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:15,268
- I thought it was worsened with the way<br/>they’re saying.

189
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:19,142
- Good evening, the world has never known<br/>a day quite like today.

It faced the considerable uncertainties

191
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:25,549
and dangers of the worst nuclear power plant<br/>accident of the atomic age.

192
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:30,274

193
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,990
in the government,<br/>lost trust in the company.

194
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,155
- It is now apparent that<br/>the nuclear accident that occurred

195
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:40,070
on Wednesday morning, was a lot more<br/>complicated and a lot more serious

196
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,456
and the public was first led to believe.

197
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:46,849
- Plant officials say radioactive Xenon gas<br/>is still being discharged

198
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:51,141
into the atmosphere from the reactor<br/>that will continue for several more days.

199
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:57,011
But is the crisis over? Once again,<br/>the utility and federal experts are at odds.

until we have a core<br/>and a coal shutdown mode.

204

- How can you say whether<br/>or not were close to a core meltdown?

205

There has been a number of incidence<br/>and accidents and spills and leaks

burned out electric wires

of the reactor’s cooling system.

A critical cooling system failed,<br/>emergency pumps went out

kept a major malfunction from turning<br/>into something far worst.

This time leading to a system-wide
shut down.
