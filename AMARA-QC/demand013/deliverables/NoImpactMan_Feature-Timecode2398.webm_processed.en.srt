219

the wheat and the bread probably comes 
from the Great Plains, way far away.

465
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:15,198
- Do you want some toilet paper?

466
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:17,073
Actually we're out of toilet paper.

467
00:23:17,073 --> 00:23:18,656
Hey, do we have any toilet paper?

468
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:20,781
<i>- [Colin] No.</i>

469
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:23,865
One thing that's really really hard 
is for a consumer to figure out

470
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:26,283
<i>what's okay to buy </i>
and what's not okay to buy

471
00:23:26,283 --> 00:23:29,240
and what should be disposable 
and what's not disposable, right?

472
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,489
- Yeah!

473
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:34,637
- So that research is really, really hard to do 
and nobody can do it all.

474
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:35,468
- Yeah!

475
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:39,963
- But, if you just cut out consuming 
the things you don't really need,

476
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:40,680
- Yes.

477
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,919
- you've already done it!

478
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,415
- Yes!

479
00:23:42,415 --> 00:23:44,199
- You don't have to do the research.

480
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:44,912
- You don't.

481
00:23:44,912 --> 00:23:47,712
- So if you discover that really, 
you don't need toilet paper

482
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,889
you can just reuse cloths.

483
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:50,502
- Yeah.

484
00:23:50,502 --> 00:23:52,587
- Yeah. You don't have to buy toilet paper

485
00:23:52,646 --> 00:23:55,217
and you don't have to do the research
about toilet paper.

486
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:56,063
- No!

487
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:57,036
- You get it?

488
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:57,886
- Yeah!

489
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,091
- Yeah!

490
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,471
- Do you really wanna be this 
graphic because...

491
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,680
[Isabella laughs]

492
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,984
- The thing about it is 
you don't know until you try.

493
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:06,429
- I feel like I'm gonna lose my job.

494
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:08,222
- Toilet paper, toilet paper..

495
00:24:08,222 --> 00:24:10,729
[Michelle laughs]

496
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:14,014
- And public health mockery of us, 
it's just gonna be...

497
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:15,683
<i>- [Colin] It's a one year experiment.</i>

498
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:16,444
- Right.

499
00:24:16,444 --> 00:24:19,003
Isn't it making you, <i>No Impact Man</i>
so fringed and wacko

500
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:23,056
that you'll just be discounted 
as a fringe wacko?

501
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:24,534
I'm just asking rhetorically.

502
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:27,695
- But if I tried it and I found 
out that it works

503
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:31,046
and its enviromentally better 
and it's not problem

504
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:35,675
and it can be done just as hygienically,

505
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:36,738
then I know don't see why 
it would cheapen it.

506
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:37,802
But, but if I don't try it...

507
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:38,708
- Okay.

508
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:39,929
- I won't know it all.

509
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:41,069
- Uh-huh.

510
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,054
- You see.

511
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,672
[Isabella talks]

512
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:45,227
- Uh-huh.

513
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:47,942
What's bad about toilet paper?

514
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:51,770
<i>- We need our trees to absorb </i>
carbon dioxide but instead,

515
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,484
<i>we're cutting them down </i>
to make toilet paper.

516
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:57,731
So part of our experiment is 
just to ask

517
00:24:57,731 --> 00:25:01,974
"Do we have to be a disposable 
culture?" Right?

518
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:04,487
And toilet, but you know -- 
and its an extreme

519
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:08,834
because we're looking at every angle 
of that disposable-ness

520
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:12,178
because the throw away culture 
itself is really a big problem.

521
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,842
and actually if we were, you know

522
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:15,280
maybe we can get away 
from everything

523
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,017
that we throw away.

524
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,588
- Tonight I was like, okay well, 
if you're gonna ask me to do this,

525
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:25,868
then I should be getting a prize, 
a coupon or a voucher

526
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:27,759
redeemable for something.

527
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,112
but I don't really want anything 
and then my next thought was

528
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:36,075
I felt the sadness for the wanting 
part of me

529
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:40,790
kind of dying a little bit and it felt like 
there was just a hole there.

530
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,151
- So what is left?

531
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:49,898
- What's that?

532
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:56,192
- It's all the stuff that were gonna give 
away from cleaning out the closets.

533
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:58,702
- Okay you ready?

534
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,373
- This is called inventory reduction.

535
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,730
[Michelle gasping]

536
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,049
I've never ever been here before 
where they put up a Marc Jacobs' store.

537
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:20,377
- You already have that exact same bag.
- No I don't, honey.

538
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:23,217
Honey, I have the white Sophia.

539
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:24,353
- And what's that?

540
00:26:24,353 --> 00:26:28,587
- That's not white. It's like kind of taupe 
but its a totally different bag.

541
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,238
[car honking]

542
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:45,613
Maybe ours was a little bigger. 
I don't know but anyway,

543
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:47,828
just reminds me of our T. V.

public radio WNYC FM and AM New York

546
00:26:57,488 --> 00:26:59,639
and WNYC dot org.

547
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:03,117
Mostly sunny skies 
in Central Park at ten oclock.

548
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:06,908
My first guest today is <i>No Impact Man</i>

549
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:11,684
Colin Beavan just walked up 24 flights 
of stairs, accompanied by your host

550
00:27:11,684 --> 00:27:17,047
who's not proud or tired to avoid 
consuming electricity in an elevator..

551
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:19,215
For those of you who happen to have 
the <i>New York Times</i> around,

552
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:21,909
take out section F, 
the House and Home Section.

553
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:25,562
There's a big green, tinted picture 
of Colin Beavan's apartment

554
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,173
with his wife, his daughter and everything.

555
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:28,251
[music playing]

556
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:30,309
One of the biggest pictures I've ever seen 
in the <i>New York Times.</i>

557
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:31,047
[laughs]

558
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:33,917
One of the littlest apartments 
I've ever seen in the <i>New York Times.</i>

559
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,025
[laughs]

560
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:36,851
I rode home from Bryan's show 
and I thought

561
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:39,817
I wonder if any of my friends saw
the <i>New York Times</i> story

562
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:45,765
and e-mailed me to say congratulations 
and there's a 150 e-mails.

563
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:50,314
The subject line says things like
"Greetings from the <i>Today's</i> show."

564
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:53,787
<i>Hi. This is Mary Noel. </i>
I'm a producer for Bill Mark.

565
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:57,805
At first I was excited, but then when 
I saw how many requests there were

566
00:27:57,805 --> 00:28:03,695
and I didn't know what to do, I went
from excited to scared out of my mind.

567
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:05,726
<i>Hi Colin. My name is Julie,</i>

568
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,758
<i>I work with the Discovery Channel.</i>

569

<i>"Hi Mr. Beavan, my name is Abe Hagras,</i>
and I'm calling from Al Jazeera English

<i>based in Washington D.C."</i>

571
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:16,965
People contacting me from Australia, 
Colombia, Germany, Italy.

572
00:28:16,965 --> 00:28:21,878
- He's doing a story about families 
who live in New York

573
00:28:21,878 --> 00:28:24,872
sort of eco-effective and environmental 
green families.

574
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:28,037
- [Female Interviewere] Can you turn 
yourself slightly more towards me?

575
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:30,188
- You see?

576
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:35,368
Not to mention like Italian television,
Japanese television.

577
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:38,021
Interview request from 
a newspaper in France.

578
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:43,129
- [Reporter] [speaking in French]

579
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:45,361
- Before we started this project, 
Michelle and I

580
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,809
- [Radio Host] Sorry you were talking 
about the philosophy, what's behind --

581
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,220
- Okay.

582
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,851
- <i>No Impact Man.</i>

583
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:52,086
- I'm kind of, always thinking about 
collective action.

584
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:56,337
What we as a society should do. 
You know, the laws that should be changed.

585
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:58,954
But one of the things, I've always been 
weak on as a Liberal

586
00:28:58,954 --> 00:28:59,890
is individual action like,

587
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,072
"Why do I have to wait for Congress
to do something?"

588
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:04,564
"Why do I have to wait for big business 
to do something?"

589
00:29:04,564 --> 00:29:05,828
"Why don't I do something?"

590
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,120
- The <i>Times</i> though makes it sound like 
part change the world,

591
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,946
part gimmick for your next book. 
Do you cop to that?

592
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:13,869
- Yeah, I totally cop to that.

593
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:16,168
You know I am who I am. This is what I do.

594
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:21,306
But if I can take the energy of who I am 
as a person and point that energy

595
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:23,878
in a direction that, you know, 
I'd say this most humbly

596
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:27,386
but and point that energy in a direction 
that can help the world,

597
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:29,959
then it's better than pointing it 
in another direction.

598
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:34,436
This is what the <i>New York Times</i>
reporter says about the project at hand.

599
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:38,395
"It may seem at best like a scene from an 
old fashioned situation comedy,"

600
00:29:38,395 --> 00:29:42,866
"and at worst, an ethically murky exercise 
in self-promotion."

601
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,431
So she wrote basically that 
the range of possibilities

602
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:50,081
was that it's bad or it's really bad.

603
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:51,322
<i>To a reader, it was really funny.</i>

604
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:56,482
<i>From my point of view, it undermines </i>
the opportunity to cause people to think.

♪ [music] ♪

606
00:29:58,603 --> 00:30:02,846
But if we called it "The year I lost 
20 pounds without going to the gym once"

607
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:08,467
or "The year we didn't watch TV and we 
became much better parents as a result."

608
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:11,946
Or if we called it "The year we ate 
locally and seasonally,

609
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:15,639
and it ended up reversing my wife's 
pre-diabetic condition."

610

There are actual benefits 
to living environmentally.

611

So this is the reader's opinions, right?

612
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:30,665
379 comments. Apparently 
it's a huge number of comments.

613

"Sacrifice now or sacrifice later. 
I'm already doing a lot

that aren't good for us.

the environment already

we don't use disposable products

772

and people say, 
"Well, what about recycling?"

773
00:39:08,157 --> 00:39:13,206
But the fact of the matter is that 
plastic recycling is not as good

774
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:14,412
as it's made out to be.

It's better than nothing 
but it's still not perfect.

776
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:20,631
So, the people call it "down cycling" 
rather than recycling

777
00:39:20,631 --> 00:39:24,853
because it goes down in quality 
everytime and then becomes toxic.

some of the stuff that we've given up

1563
01:25:30,123 --> 01:25:32,153
we'll take back 
but the fact is that the balance

1564

will be that we're just

and without adversely 
affecting our happiness.

1567

The fact of the matter is that 
if only I change

1568
01:25:45,102 --> 01:25:46,813
it's not gonna make a difference.

1569

But, the hope is that if each of us 
as individuals change,

1570
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:53,989
it's going to inspire everybody to change.

1571
01:25:53,989 --> 01:25:58,655
So, I believe the most radical, 
political act there is, is to be an optimist.

1572
01:25:58,655 --> 01:26:01,565
The most radical, political act there is, 
is to believe that if I change,

other people will follow suit.

1574
01:26:03,093 --> 01:26:07,972
The reason why I am here is 
because a first grader called Olive,

1575
01:26:07,972 --> 01:26:11,773
wrote to me on my blog 
and asked me if I would come.

1576
01:26:11,773 --> 01:26:15,444
People ask me, if I could just 
do one thing, what should it be?

1577
01:26:15,444 --> 01:26:18,955
Not use plastic bags 
or not use plastic cups,

1578
01:26:19,755 --> 01:26:22,797
I would say, if there was 
only one thing to do

1579
01:26:22,797 --> 01:26:25,842
it would be to volunteer with
an environmental organization.

1580
01:26:25,842 --> 01:26:28,755
Part of the reason for that
is because there is community.

1581
01:26:28,755 --> 01:26:33,366
I believe very strongly that a lot of the
environmental problems in our planet

1582
01:26:33,366 --> 01:26:35,872
have come because of the 
breakdown of community.

1583
01:26:35,872 --> 01:26:36,957
Because without community,

none of us feel accountable 
to anybody else.

You know, if you're religious
