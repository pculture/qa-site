      <p begin="00:26:27.300" end="00:26:28.734">But see, none of that occurred.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:29.809" end="00:26:32.561">Finally, with the Agee's owing<br/>1500 dollars in back payments,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:32.561" end="00:26:36.215">St. Joseph's forced Arthur<br/>to leave the school.</p>
