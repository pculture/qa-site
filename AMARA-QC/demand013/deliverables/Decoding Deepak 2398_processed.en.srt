how that happens.

These cells are going to your lungs,
absorbing the oxygen from the atmosphere.

Your body is performing hundreds

This ground that I stand on is spinning
at about a quarter of mile per second

18 and half miles per second.

00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,998
I think the real me
is this endless process.

I am the photons.

253
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,836
I am the movement of the Earth,
I am the spiraling of the stars,

I am the universe and so are you.

255
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:34,206
And when we recognize that,
then we have conquered death

256
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:37,780
and gone beyond the illusion
of beginning and ending.

261
00:15:58,236 --> 00:16:03,013
of the same being, it doesn't matter who
the director, who the protagonist,

262
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:08,244
who the antagonist, who the villain,
who the hero, who the choreographer is.

It's the same consciousness playing
different roles.

- By now, Papa is well aware
that the cameras are rolling all the time.

320
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:35,946
And he probably knows I'm aiming
to get him with his guard down.

321
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:40,287
I also keep the cameras running
because there's nothing else to do.

322
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:44,433
But in the process, I'm starting
to notice something about us.

323
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,962
We follow the same script as always,

324

the dutiful teacher takes the floor,
the wayward student rolls his eyes.

325
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:55,497
Even as the monk handbook calls
for meditation on the moment that is now,

326
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:59,765
old rivalries boils up from the life

I'm not in the body, the body is me.

328
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:06,057
I'm not in the mind,
the mind is in me.

329
00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:08,228
I am the creator of the mind,
the body and the world.

330
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:13,165
Now you say that to somebody like
Michael Shermer, he pulls his head out

331
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:16,297
but he has no idea
what he's talking about.

332
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:21,435
As usual, Papa's present
but not entirely.

333
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:25,055
He's still irritated about a particularly
contentious Nightline debate

334
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:26,522

335

with the language

336

but what does it really mean to say,
there's "Quantum consciousness?"

337
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:32,497
- When you say,
"I'm skeptical about this,"

338
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,164
who's the "I" that's skeptical?

339

Is it your network or is it you?

of this experiment in monkhood,

348
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,263

between the stoic philosopher, Deepak,

349
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,555

and the guy I know as my Dad.

any mundane question

00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:15,131

we were at the Peninsula...

353

We had a nice breakfast,
we went down to the spa...

354
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:21,400
Can you talk about the contrast?

355
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,500
- Well, all experiences by contrast,

356
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,334
if you didn't know what hot was,
you wouldn't know cold.

357
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:30,824
If you didn't know what pleasure was,
you wouldn't know pain.

358
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:37,301
But that pleasure, pain, the sacred,
the profane, the divine, the diabolical,

359
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:43,065
this is the contained conflict,
which we call evolution.

360
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:48,103
In the absence of that,
life is stale, mummified, static.

you can take it with you
where ever you go.

"Don't worry about it,

00:29:56,132 --> 00:30:00,528
and then an interview with
USA Today and Tonight.

462
00:30:00,528 --> 00:30:02,800
- And just like that,
we're back in the hustle.

463
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,165
The world of monkhood
and monastery is half a world away.

464
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:08,400
I'm not sure what to make of all that.

465
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,367
No time to even figure it out.

466
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:13,154
So you wanna know something
about journalists?

467
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:18,656
They want to know some of the facts,
they don't wanna know the truth.

468
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:21,726
But they're always interested
in a good story.

469
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:24,657

can I?

I know where it is,
right here, right?

472
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:36,557
- We have two minutes
until we go live on air,

473
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:40,052
so I can catch up with my e-mails.

474
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:42,775
- Are you nervous you're about
to go on air?

475
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:45,591
- Gotham, I haven't felt nervous
since I was 14 years of age.

476
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:46,641
Okay.

477
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:48,422
- [female reporter] Good morning
live in New York, on the day

478
00:30:48,422 --> 00:30:52,091
that his new book comes out, why did you
and your publisher make that choice?

479
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:53,253
- Well, thanks.

480
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,721
Well, there's a lot of buzz
on the internet,

481
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,719
on Twitter, on Facebook,

482
00:30:57,719 --> 00:31:01,671
a lot of conversations going on
in places like Saudi Arabia,

483
00:31:01,671 --> 00:31:04,069
it's getting a lot of attention.

484
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,366
The book is getting a lot of attention.

485
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:13,337
A few people are worried that in fact
it may inflame tensions, I don't think so.

486
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:17,416
- Tensions are swirling
as the 9th anniversary of 9/11 draws near.

487
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:22,537
The self help Guru, Deepak Chopra,
steps in with a fictionalized biography

488
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,775
of the Prophet Muhammad.

489
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:26,259
- Book sellers were nervous about that?

490
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,307
- Yes.

491
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,442
- The path of monkhood was meant to
embrace detachment,

492
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:33,380
which in my father's eyes apparently means
detachment from the controversy

493
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,810
around his latest publication.

494
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:41,822
The fact was things were boiling over
on CNN, NBC, ABC and of course Fox News.

495
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:43,774
- What did you say about Fox,
that we wanna...

496
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:50,249
- Fox and your self have whole heartedly
cheered on the disastrous war in Iraq.

497
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:51,875
So I can understand why you continue

498
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,982
to mount a rear guard--
- Deepak, I don't understand...

499
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:57,394
Wait, wait... Hang on a second.

500
00:31:57,394 --> 00:32:01,432
- I'm excited all the time
to talk about anything.

501
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:06,948
- Here's the truth about growing up
chasing my Dad

502
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:08,910
through a life
of haphazardly orchestrated

503
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:14,393
speaking tours, media junkets,
public spectacle of televised debates.

504
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:16,429
When people approach him,
he knows all the appropriate humble things

505
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:19,915
to say
but the more closely I follow him,

506
00:32:19,915 --> 00:32:25,192
the more I see that he's driven
by an insatiable hunger to be relevant.

507
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:29,186
And where are we going now?

508
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:32,181

of "Muhhamad:
A Story of the Last Prophet".

510
00:32:35,178 --> 00:32:37,250

talking about tonight or what is the...?

511
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,291
- Guess what?
Jesus Christ.

513
00:32:41,262 --> 00:32:44,295
- Just a little about Deepak's background,
as you probably know,

514
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:49,854
he has written over 50 books,
translated into 35 languages...

First of all, thank you very much
for being here.

00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:24,243
This is my first event with "Muhhamad:
The Story of the Last Prophet".

525
00:33:24,243 --> 00:33:25,308
- How do you feel that that went?

526
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:26,990
- I think it was spectacular.

527
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,989
- Yeah?

528
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,905
- I loved it. You can feel the energy
in the room, right?

529
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:31,030
Yeah?

530
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:36,962
- We're gonna start the line right here
and if everyone, please,

531
00:33:36,962 --> 00:33:43,414
in an orderly fashion,
will single file go down this side

532
00:33:43,414 --> 00:33:46,612
and then we'll run the line out the door.

533
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:50,079
Everybody please single file.

534
00:33:52,715 --> 00:33:54,835
- We have to keep moving, huh?

535
00:33:57,149 --> 00:33:59,696
- It's clear that my Dad has settled
comfortably back into the role

536
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:01,670
that's expected of him.

537
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,189
And while he seems
to genuinely believe his journey

538
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:08,328
to monkhood changed him, it appears to me,
his concerns about the critical receptions

539
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:12,895
of his latest book are a present as ever.

540
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:17,333
I followed him to Thailand, curious to see
if his ordainment would truly change him,

541
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:20,847
for now, I can't really say it did.

542

Are we late?

543
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,371
- Are we late?
Every moment we are closer to death.

544
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:30,305

549
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:58,234

You start to get lost,

You go to sleep in one city

where the line

What do you think
the film should really be about?

00:35:57,669 --> 00:36:00,231
What it should be about
or what I hope it's about,

566
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:04,681
I think Papa lives in a world,
in which he's the center of the universe

567
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:07,380
and everything revolves around him,

568
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,564
and so I think it's whether he is
on a journey to become a monk

569
00:36:10,564 --> 00:36:13,275
but can't let go of his Blackberry.

570
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:19,375
I hope at the end of the film,
people take away the humanity of him

and themselves.

consciousness.

573
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:26,249
- Yeah, of course, because
that is his passion.

574
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:28,669
So obviously he wants a film
about consciousness.

575
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,973
- Papa, can you tell us where we are?

self involved.

I think the most important

589

and to be heard.

590
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:21,150
If he didn't have an audience,
it would be a complete problem for him.

00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:51,612
Maybe when you and Mallika were small,
he was still trying to prove himself.

617
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:54,070
Now, he's proved
whatever he needs to prove.

618
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:58,044
And so that's completely taken
out of the way, so he doesn't need

619
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,777
to put his energy into proving himself.

620
00:39:01,777 --> 00:39:05,771
- He may not need
to prove anything but I do.

621
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:08,520
For a long time, I wanted to replace
the sea of adoring faces

622
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,165
and constant applause with some humility.

623
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:14,359
The proverbial, "Bigger picture."

624
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:19,076
But now somethings changing,
I've turned the cameras on my own family.

625
00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:22,127
Opening up our lives
to be viewed by the world.

626
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:25,112
Just as my father did before me.

627
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,606
How much of this story
is actually about us?

628
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:29,358
About me?

629
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,502
Fragments stretched over decades
about a father who wasn't there

630
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:38,133
to the Guru who was, to my trying
to reconcile what the world sees in my dad

631
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:40,217
that maybe I can't.

Sedona is known for Vortexes.

641
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:27,979
And of course, the plural of "Vortex"
is "Vortices" but in Sedona,

642
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:31,072
they're called "Vortexes"
and we tap into that energy

643
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:34,188
and through the guidance
and leadership of Deepak Chopra,

644
00:40:34,188 --> 00:40:37,271
we weave the stillness and sounds
and we connect to nature

645
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,032
and we connect to this energy.

646
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:47,945
- Move with the grass. Beautiful.
Lift your face to the sky.

647
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,683
- In a place where people
from all over the world can tap into

648
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:58,222
this dialogue of Adanta, of consciousness,
of healing, of love, of expansion.

649
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:07,245
[audience applauding]

650
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:09,068
- So, hows life?

651
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:11,383
[audience laughing]

652
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:12,806
- What's up?

653
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:14,337
[audience laughing]

654
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:19,069
This week get into habit of "Being."

655
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:23,293
The art of being is called,"Raja Yoga."

656
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:27,802
- Do you think people grasp
a lot of what he's talking about?

657
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:31,751
I mean does a lot of he's talking about
go over their heads? Fly by people?

658
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:34,956
- You know, I think we all have had
the experience of sitting in the audience

659
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:40,386
and Deepak speaks,and you go...

660
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:43,200
- A self-image is
our personal history

661
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,993
which is composed of memories
of things that no longer exist.

662
00:41:47,993 --> 00:41:50,168
- And then you leave,
and then you say,

663
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:52,134
"I just had the most
transformational..."

664
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,483
I don't know,
I can't even describe it.

665
00:41:54,483 --> 00:41:56,273
Like, really?
what did he say?

666
00:41:56,273 --> 00:42:00,419
Like... I don't have a clue.

667
00:42:00,419 --> 00:42:05,009
- Creativity, higher guidance transcends.

668
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:07,730
Go over this many times.
This is the practice.

669
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,449
If you do this, this week,
along with your meditation

670
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:13,909
and everything else that we're doing--
yoga, breathing,

671
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:18,397
then actually-- thanks for coming
and go home.

672
00:42:18,397 --> 00:42:20,151
[audience laughing]

673
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:24,808
[applause]

674
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:29,179
There is a phenomenon called
the "New Age."

675
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:33,613
The New Age phenomenon is looking
for the paranormal,

676
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:41,274
is looking for spirituality.
A lot of it is hype.

677
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:43,584
Maybe some of this activity
that happened here

678
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:45,300
doesn't excite me.

679
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,477
But on the other hand,
I'm really sensitive to people's needs,

680
00:42:48,477 --> 00:42:52,247
and people have a variety of this.

681
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:59,120
- I'm living in a world
that sees itself in my father.

682
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,261
The reality of his life gets lost
in the picture

683
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:03,744
his audiences constructed of it.

684
00:43:03,744 --> 00:43:06,832
It's as if, he actually loved doing yoga.

685
00:43:06,832 --> 00:43:09,285
As if he were strict vegetarian.

686
00:43:09,285 --> 00:43:12,515
As if he had time for anything
besides these 60 odd books

687
00:43:12,515 --> 00:43:15,619
he's written about life.

688
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:18,188
As a young man, he did promote yoga.

689
00:43:18,188 --> 00:43:21,363
He was a disciple
of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

690
00:43:21,363 --> 00:43:24,183
He became Maharishi's protegee
and took the lead

691
00:43:24,183 --> 00:43:26,909
translating Maharishi's ideas
and making them accessible

692
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:29,016
to western audience.

693
00:43:29,016 --> 00:43:31,327
So, did the Beatles.

694
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:35,817
But time's changed. My Dad grew beyond
the teachings of Maharishi

695
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:39,184
because he didn't want to be
the same type of guru.

696
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,577
He did't want to repeat the familiar tale
of the holy men

697
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,948
descending from the mountain top.

698
00:43:43,948 --> 00:43:48,839
Your act of recognition, devotion
and fading into obscurity.

699
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:52,475
So, rather than adopt to one code,
he adopted many.

700
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:56,021
He allowed people to use his ideas
however they wanted.

701
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:57,843
Who's he to argue with them?

702
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,831
- Why should we be embarrassed
about selling knowledge or wisdom?

703
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:07,019
In fact, I think the day will come
where we can already equal

704
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,711
the Age of Enlightenment

705
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:12,147
where the only products and services
that will be of value

706
00:44:12,147 --> 00:44:16,050
will be those that empower people
have them transform,

707
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,188
help them enhance their self-esteem
and make them happy.

708
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:20,692
This is what we're doing.

709
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,521
- In his eyes,
these people are responsible

710
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:24,519
for their own happiness.

711
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:28,630
He's just the catalyst
in the form of a book,

712
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,628
or a workshop, or a video.

713
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:34,139
And once I looked beyond the crystals
and the scented candles

714
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:37,939
and all the things that have always
seemed kind of funny to me,

715
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:42,027
he has an ability to move people
in a way that I find admirable.

716
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:46,508
- For me, seduction of spirit
is just the ultimate.

717
00:44:46,508 --> 00:44:51,184
I want this course to help me know
what my Dharma is, what is my purpose.

718
00:44:51,184 --> 00:44:56,077
- He is very grounded,
and he's actually so warm

719
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:57,839
and I feel like he's a teddy bear.

720
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,871
I just want to keep hiding him.
[laughs]

721
00:45:01,871 --> 00:45:06,797
- I just continue to be impressed
with each new book that he releases

722
00:45:06,797 --> 00:45:11,511
and I think it is my crux in life
to share that with the people.

723
00:45:11,511 --> 00:45:15,420
- I can honestly say I can't recall a time
when my father made me cry.

724
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,781
What is the root of this deep devotion?

725
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:21,556
You can trace it all back
to a singular moment in time

726
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:24,856
when Oprah Winfrey put my Dad
into the mainstream.

727
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:28,517
- I decided to invite my first guess
on the show after getting a phone call

728
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,042
from Michael Jackson.

729
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:34,062
He was calling to let me know
that I absolutely had to have

730
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:36,560
Dr. Deepak Chopra on the show.

731
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,368
- Michael convinced Oprah to listen.

732
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,954
Oprah convinced others to listen.

733
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:42,458
- So how evangelical are you, then?
That's really the issue.

734
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,253
- Not at all evangelical, please.

735
00:45:44,253 --> 00:45:46,066
- How do you control
every cell in your body?

736
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:49,131
- See, because in less than a year,
you replace your entire body

737
00:45:49,131 --> 00:45:50,841
down to the last atom.

738
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:54,647
Which means that right now,
what you're seeing is my 1993 model.

739
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:59,849
And the body I had last year is gone.

740
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:02,415
- Over time, his ideas started
to really take hold.

741
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:05,712
First, to the special interests,
to celebrity dabblers

742
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:07,667
then to the mainstream.

743
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:13,643
- People will spend a lifetime
become seminar junkies.

744
00:46:13,643 --> 00:46:20,357
They will be able to report every book
in the world that they have read.

745
00:46:20,357 --> 00:46:25,616
They will be able to write books,
and yet their life can be a mess.

was an early Deepak adopter.

He loved my Dad.

Through my father, I got to know
Michael well.

750
00:46:44,098 --> 00:46:47,891
We became friends, brothers almost.

751
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:51,372
I visited Neverland and got to see
firsthand the triumphs,

752
00:46:51,372 --> 00:46:56,495
the torture, the tragedy,
and eventually the truth.

753
00:46:56,495 --> 00:47:01,356
That my Dad who might be able
to mesmerize millions with his teachings

754
00:47:01,356 --> 00:47:04,818
couldn't save some of those

cured them in advanced cancer.

Stay with us.

758
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:16,344
- Eventually, there comes a point
we have to ask,

759
00:47:16,344 --> 00:47:20,712
how much of what we discover,
what we teach, what we reflect on

760
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:24,313
and document through the years,
how much of it makes a difference?

761
00:47:24,313 --> 00:47:28,737
The idealism of youth never seems
to outlast time.

762
00:47:28,737 --> 00:47:32,328
- So, tell me how you met.
You sought my Dad out, is that right?

763
00:47:32,328 --> 00:47:35,092
- Yeah, well, I mean your Dad's
reputation preceded him.

764
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:40,836
Up until that time,there was kind
of a meditation spiritual world on one end

765
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:41,919
and a scientific world
on the other end.

766
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:43,608
Your dad helped to bring them together.

767
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:47,329
- Joining our panel is Dr. David Simon,
a neurologist who up until a year ago

thought that Dr. Chopra's methods
couldn't work.

769
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,861
You were a skeptic.
You are now involved actively

770
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:53,747
with Dr. Chopra, right?

771
00:47:53,747 --> 00:48:00,780
- I mean we nurtured each other
by exploring various models

772
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,859
of what is consciousness.

773
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:04,775
And you know, that's why
it's such a paradox

774
00:48:04,775 --> 00:48:08,407
that a few months ago,
I'm in New York

775
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:13,071
and I got a text from David and it says,
"Please call me."

776
00:48:13,071 --> 00:48:15,842
"I have sad news for you."

777
00:48:26,035 --> 00:48:29,008
So, I immediately
picked up the phone and called

778
00:48:29,008 --> 00:48:30,308
because that's kind of alarming.

779
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:36,523
- I know that was. I always worry
when you give me these messages.

780
00:48:36,523 --> 00:48:38,207
- So, what happened? He says,

781
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:41,505
You know, I was having
little visual defects

782
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:44,438
and I decided to go
and get a CAT scan

783
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:47,172
and I diagnosed my own brain tumor.

784
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:51,556
I have gliobastoma.

785
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:57,651
It's you know, one of those moments
you never forget in your life

786
00:48:57,651 --> 00:48:59,889
because I said, of all the people, David.

787
00:48:59,889 --> 00:49:02,709
I mean, we've been documenting
mind, body and soul forever

788
00:49:02,709 --> 00:49:07,556
and you know, if there's anyone
who has done everything right--

789
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:09,584
this is the mystery of our existence.

790
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:13,412
- So, what do you say to people--
our audience watching TV who have cancer?

791
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:14,469
What will you say to them?

792
00:49:14,469 --> 00:49:17,952
- I say that become a participant
in all alternatives

793
00:49:17,952 --> 00:49:24,661
and do not, do not discount
some of the really miraculous things

794
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,616
that are happening in modern medicine.

795
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:27,927
[applause]

796
00:49:27,927 --> 00:49:29,779
- We'd kind of joke about it,
laugh about it--

797
00:49:29,779 --> 00:49:33,271
what is the meaning of death.

798
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:38,736
I think this particular conversation
should be seen by anyone who's gonna die.

799
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:42,413
- Which is everyone.
[laughs]

800
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:44,946
- It's a must-see for anyone
who's gonna die.

801
00:49:44,946 --> 00:49:48,863
I mean he's got a diagnosis
but we're all on death row.

802
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:53,343
The only uncertainty is the method
of execution and the length of reprieve.

803
00:49:53,343 --> 00:49:56,248
- It seems maybe a little morbid
but I'm kind of curious about it

804
00:49:56,248 --> 00:49:58,340
what's my death going to be like?

805
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:02,710
Is there any sense of individuality
that's gonna prevail

806
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,332
or is it all goes back into Universe?

807
00:50:05,332 --> 00:50:11,318
I mean I have to say that
because I've had your dad in my mind

808
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:13,613
for so long, that sometimes
I don't really know

809
00:50:13,613 --> 00:50:15,830
where I end and where he begins.

810
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:16,872
- I love you, David.

811
00:50:16,872 --> 00:50:18,888
- I love you too, Deepak.

812
00:50:18,888 --> 00:50:22,664
I'll try to stay around with you
as long as possible.

813
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:30,586
- We're back in New York City.
Death is on my dad's mind.

814
00:50:30,586 --> 00:50:33,698
Time no longer seems so abstract.

815
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:37,877
I sense in him a desperation to reach
more people with his message.

816
00:50:37,877 --> 00:50:40,255
His message is changing.

817
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:44,078
No longer satisfied with New Age seminars
and red rock deserts.

818
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:48,958
Now's the time for spiritual solutions
in the real world.

819
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:51,899
- Wellness Radio
with Deepak Chopra presents

820
00:50:51,899 --> 00:50:54,804
"The Road to Global
Nuclear Disarmament."

821
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:59,109
Featuring former CIA Operations Officer,
Valerie Plame Wilson,

822
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:00,841
Her Majesty, Queen Noor of Jordan,

823
00:51:00,841 --> 00:51:03,438
and Lawrence Bender, producer
of "Countdown to Zero."

824
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:06,847
And now, your host, Deepak Chopra.

825
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:09,375
- You know, when I was growing up
in the 1960s,

826
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,749
nuclear weapons was a topic.

827
00:51:11,749 --> 00:51:15,109
Everybody knew about it.
Schoolchildren were talking about it.

828
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:17,190
College students were talking
about it.

829
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,759
We thought at that moment
that you know,

830
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:22,742
with the great conversation
going on in the world--

831
00:51:22,742 --> 00:51:27,614
the peace movement,
the anti-war movement in Vietnam,

832
00:51:27,614 --> 00:51:30,407
the equality movement,
the feminist movement--

833
00:51:30,407 --> 00:51:33,750
they're all kind of coming together
all at the same time.

834
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,221
And we thought, maybe in a few years,
we'll be living in a different world.

835
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:42,275
And despite that,
everything continued as it was.

836
00:51:42,275 --> 00:51:46,989
The destruction of the environment,
racism, ethnocentricism,

837
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:51,031
extreme nationalism; more war,
more conflict.

838
00:51:51,031 --> 00:51:55,442
And somehow,this whole business
with nuclear weapons

839
00:51:55,442 --> 00:51:58,533
kind of slipped
from our awareness completely.

840
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,614
Hey, do you see that poster?
You know who that is?

841
00:52:00,614 --> 00:52:04,599
That man, who's doing this?
Who is he?

842
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:05,978
- I don't know.

843
00:52:05,978 --> 00:52:07,740
- His name is Puff Daddy.

844
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:11,983
You don't care, huh?

845
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:20,336
We have an amazing tendency
to kind of fall asleep.

846
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:27,630
We have to keep moving.
Okay, we can cross this.

847
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,436
If we manage to live through all this,
someday we'll look back

848
00:52:30,436 --> 00:52:35,807
at these times as a collective psychosis
that engulfed the whole world.

849
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:37,609
[camera clicking]

850
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:39,689
- Thank you. Okay.

851
00:52:50,813 --> 00:52:57,416
- This is a film about identity.
The title should be "Infinite Being."

852
00:52:57,416 --> 00:53:02,357
Actually, better than "Infinite Being" is,
you know what a good title is?

853
00:53:02,357 --> 00:53:04,004
Being.

854
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:08,594
- Being.

855
00:53:08,594 --> 00:53:10,340
- That's it.

856
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:13,938
- Over time, I've come to appreciate
how my Dad's mind never stops racing

857
00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:16,056
from one idea to the next.

858
00:53:16,056 --> 00:53:20,902
His ideas for the film are as scattered
as his list of special projects.

859
00:53:20,902 --> 00:53:24,267
A series of celebrity guru appearances
injecting Dad's philosophy

860
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:27,035
about quantum physics
into the mainstream.

861
00:53:27,035 --> 00:53:33,625
- You're part of a matrix of information
that exists in a space time geometry

862
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:35,646
at Planck scale.

863
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:38,059
- Will society ever embrace
Planck scale geometry

864
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:41,027
the way they've embraced yoga?
I doubt it.

865
00:53:41,027 --> 00:53:43,486
But I've gotta give the guy
credit for trying.

866
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:47,329
My father comes from a generation
of dreamers.

867
00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:49,158
And the older he gets,
the more anxious he is

868
00:53:49,158 --> 00:53:52,027
to get his message out
to as many people as he can.

869
00:53:52,027 --> 00:53:55,025
For him, that now means
pure meditation workshops

870
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:58,182
with post-modern hippies
and more TV pilots

871
00:53:58,182 --> 00:53:59,547
with A-list celebrities.

872
00:53:59,547 --> 00:54:01,491
- People have no choice.
- This notions are becoming faster...

873
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:05,486
- The technology or the growth
or the changes that we've experienced

874
00:54:05,486 --> 00:54:09,365
have done nothing to make us better.

875
00:54:09,365 --> 00:54:12,307
- You know, most people think
of spiritual people like my father,

876
00:54:12,307 --> 00:54:14,546
certainly Indian gurus
and they think of Ashrams,

877
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:17,335
they think of removing yourself
from the world.

878
00:54:17,335 --> 00:54:20,392
But my Dad's lifestyle's kind of--
I mean, yours is you live large

879
00:54:20,392 --> 00:54:22,002
but his is kind of like that, too.

880
00:54:22,002 --> 00:54:24,230
He loves New York. It's his Ashram.

881
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,118
- He's an urban yogi.

882
00:54:26,118 --> 00:54:29,486
- That doesn't-- in the scripture,
you don't want to argue

883
00:54:29,486 --> 00:54:31,029
if whether he wants to go meditate.

884
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:32,210
Krishna says, "fuck that!"

885
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,088
You go out there
and chop their heads off.

886
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:35,833
Right now, get to work.

887
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:36,874
- Meditate.

888
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:37,887
- Get out of here.

889
00:54:37,887 --> 00:54:39,608
Krishna taught Ashnu
on the battlefield.

890
00:54:39,608 --> 00:54:43,104
- You are sharing with me and everybody
on this planet right now.

891
00:54:43,104 --> 00:54:44,920
- That is phenomenal. I love that.

892
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,947
- One bread, one bread...

893
00:54:46,947 --> 00:54:49,365
- Your father has turned so many keys
in so many's heads.

894
00:54:49,365 --> 00:54:51,646
He is the person they look for
to be saved.

895
00:54:51,646 --> 00:54:54,936
Just as any great preacher
or any great rabbi

896
00:54:54,936 --> 00:54:59,006
has many followers in his congregation
who is giving light.

897
00:55:00,957 --> 00:55:04,649
Where there's lots of noise,
he's trying to relieve the noise.

898
00:55:05,337 --> 00:55:08,159
- Listening to Russell Simmons
wax philosophical

899
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:10,867
about inner stillness is starting
to make me feel old.

900
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:14,125
In fact the whole world seems
to be good at moving too fast

901
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,815
for people to keep up.

902
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:19,267
While I've been out shooting a movie,
my little boy has been growing up.

903
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:20,862
What did you say?

904
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:22,291
- Fuck!

905
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:24,658
- Soon, he'll grow beyond his toys.

906
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:29,158
- Without the co-existence
of contained conflict, there's no movie.

907
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:31,128
Right?

908
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:36,239
- And my father wants to make sure
he's listening, too.

909
00:55:36,592 --> 00:55:41,850
Growing up, I played lots of video games,
but not once with my Dad.

910
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:45,497
Of course now, he's using video games
to navigate chakras,

911
00:55:45,497 --> 00:55:50,838
because he wants to shape the minds
of an audience he's never reached before.

912
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:54,285
- You just use your right hand.
It's only set up for the right hand

913
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:56,819
right now.

914
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:00,601
It's interesting, this one.
If you think too much about it,

915
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:01,841
it's very hard.

916
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:03,621
But if you just sort of let it go...

917
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:06,520
- If you think about anything, it's hard

918
00:56:08,837 --> 00:56:11,293
- We're here at Curious Pictures
and we've been working with Deepak

919
00:56:11,293 --> 00:56:16,338
for the last 18 months on
his new video game titled "Leela."

920
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:20,476
Deepak had this idea

and was in meditation 24 hours
on my death,

you meditate on impermanence

so you realize how precious life is.

any of this footage,

He'll hear the echoes of his ancestors.

1076
01:06:07,309 --> 01:06:12,823
And he'll search for answers
about his father, about himself.

1077
01:06:15,658 --> 01:06:19,847
How important is your family to you?

1078
01:06:19,847 --> 01:06:23,632
My family is important.
But you know, as I'm growing older,

1079
01:06:23,632 --> 01:06:26,320
the only people that I'm really
attached to

1080
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,521
is my grandchildren, right now.

1081
01:06:28,521 --> 01:06:30,735
You're both grown up
and you're on your own

1082
01:06:30,735 --> 01:06:32,684
and you know...

1083
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,679
- Do you really think you are
changing the world?

1084
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:38,774
- Me personally, no.
But the world is changing

1085
01:06:38,774 --> 01:06:43,814
and I'm part of what you call
a transition team,

1086
01:06:43,814 --> 01:06:45,305
a midwife.

1087
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:49,691
- Yeah, but Papa, there's no question,
I mean, we've seen it the last few months.

1088
01:06:49,691 --> 01:06:51,841
We've seen it my whole life.

1089
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:56,228
I mean, people are moved by you
or they follow you.

1090
01:06:56,228 --> 01:06:58,530
I mean, they do.
At least in their eyes,

1091
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:02,586
you are changing them.
I mean, you know that.

1092
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:04,204
You must sense that.

1093
01:07:04,204 --> 01:07:07,084
- Yeah, it did come up,
at least I have seen their lives.

1094
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:09,454
And they're probably ready
to change anyway

1095
01:07:09,454 --> 01:07:15,680
and I happened to come along
in their life in the form of a book.

1096
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,066
It's all kind of strange.

1097
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:20,499
- There's no ego in it?

1098
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:22,450
- None whatsoever.

1099
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,094

- Ahuh. Do you contemplate your death?

1102
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:34,445
- Yeah, I'm very aware of my death.
I'm 64, yeah.

1103
01:07:34,445 --> 01:07:38,364
I mean, on the other hand,
life is unpredictable, you know.

But now looks like he might go before me.

always is, "Who am I?"

How do you define I?

who are you asking the question of?

Who am I? Who am I? Where do I exist?

Where's the boundary
between me and that abyss?

Where do I begin and where do I end?

Did I begin with the Big Bang?

Or when my parents

Or when I was conceived,
or I was born?

If you go inside my body

you won't find me there,

Is not the sun, and this light
and this atmosphere

1157
01:11:28,224 --> 01:11:32,674

as my heart, liver and bone?

You are a relationship.
We are all a relationship.

1161
01:11:43,244 --> 01:11:45,471
We are inseparably interconnected.

1162
01:11:45,471 --> 01:11:48,600
Our souls are entangled,
we're part of a matrix

1163
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,263
in that entanglement
which is not only across space

1164
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:53,931
but across time.

1165
01:11:53,931 --> 01:11:54,930
Do we have a soul?

1166
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:55,929
Do we have a soul?

1167

What happens to us after we die?

I think what we've seen

1173
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,277

01:12:07,277 --> 01:12:10,273
There is definitely some continuity there.

1175
01:12:10,273 --> 01:12:13,289
You know, our minds
are part theirs.

1176
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:15,485
In a sense, we're all a mirror
of each other.

1177
01:12:15,485 --> 01:12:20,531
You and I are just
differentiated aspects of the same being.

1178
01:12:20,531 --> 01:12:24,092
We are the same being
in different disguises.

1179
01:12:24,092 --> 01:12:27,152
The real "I" was never born
and doesn't die

1180
01:12:27,152 --> 01:12:31,731
and it's not your personal,
physical body or even your personality.

1181
01:12:31,731 --> 01:12:36,437
It has no definition in space,
no boundaries in time.

1182
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:40,809
It's eternal, it is unborn
and it does not die.

01:12:42,577 --> 01:12:43,694
- We're done?

1184
01:12:43,694 --> 01:12:45,397
- Done.

1185
01:12:49,509 --> 01:12:53,475
I've said what I need to say
and I did it well, so I'm happy.
