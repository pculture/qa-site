00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:33,948
So cut down our trees.

315
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:35,865
Use all of our oil.

316
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,627
Take advantage of everything that
the Earth has to offer.

317
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:41,487
That's why you hear them getting involved
with issues like global warming.

318
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,469
You wanna shake them and you wanna say,

319
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,242
"What,what is it
that you're not understanding

320
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:50,092
about the fundamentals of Christianity?"

321
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:53,103
"How did you get here?"

322
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:55,489
Our President is still
telling Americans that

323
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:59,190
we should teach creationism
in our schools.

324
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,622
That we should teach it right along side
with evolution.

325
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:06,501
- I think we've become
absolutely complacent in this

326
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:09,919
and I think that they're composing
exactly what they want!

327
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,766
- Do you know what's happening in Kansas?

328
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,093
- Oh, I know. I saw that.

329
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:18,165
- They have to teach intelligent design
right along with Darwin's evolution.

330
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:19,975
Well, think about that?

331
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:23,718
You got 600,000 children
that are being lied to.

332
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:26,447
- There is no conflict between the two.

333
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:27,446
- Well, I...

334
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,424
- That religion is not science.

335
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:35,252
- We have a population, 25% out of the
American population right now

336
00:19:35,252 --> 00:19:37,036
describe themselves as Evangelicals.

337
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:40,039
That's about, about 80 million people.

338
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,004
They're very tenacious,
and they elbow their way

339
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:44,969
into positions of power in America.

340
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:49,989
That is the M. O. of a group
that is committed to -

341
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:54,059
like I say - building a government
that they're comfortable with.

342
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,266
In the end, it's gonna come like thief
in the night.

343
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:58,839
There's this slow chipping away

344
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,790
at the separation
between church and state.

[cheering]

349
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:35,304
Jesus died and was buried.
Three days later, he rose from the dead.

350
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:39,644
Wasn't Jesus only a man? No.

351
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:42,321
Jesus Christ is Almighty God.

352
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:43,320
- Come on, Rachel.

353
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,548
- Rachel, it's your turn.

354
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:45,547
- Rachel, it's your turn.

355
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:47,014
- I know!

356
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,155
- Go ahead, Rachel.

357
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:49,305
- There you go, Rachel. Get a strike.

358
00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:51,387
- Yeah, yeah! Get it strike this time!

[music playing]

Your Spirit would help to make this

00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,805
one a good one.

362
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,727
Ball, I command you to - in the name
of Jesus. Make a good hit!

363
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,011
- Alright! Rachel!

- This side of it to bowl.

367
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:17,642
- Okay.

368
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:40,770
- Hi. God is telling me
that you're on His mind

369
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,453
and He just wants to take you
and He just wants to love on you

370
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:49,160
and He has special plans for you,
in your life.

371
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,992
He just wants you to be able to follow
Him with your whole heart.

372
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:55,008
- Thank you!

373
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:57,468
- Your welcome.

374
00:21:57,468 --> 00:21:59,151
- Appreciate it.

375
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,967
- Welcome.

376
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,985
- Wow! So you saw her need
and felt like God told you

377
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:13,075
to go over there.

378
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:15,633
- Yeah! I waited a little bit.
You know, to be sure.

379
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:16,632
You know what I mean.

380
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,002
- Kept coming into your heart.

381
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,717
- Uh huh. And afterwards I felt like
I had picked the right one.

382
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:24,644
- All right! Good job, Rachel.
Trying to be obedient.

383
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:27,587
[laughs]

384
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:35,592
- I like bowling ministry. There we go!

385
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:41,989
When I grow up, I just -
I always thought it would be kind of fun

386
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:44,693
to be one of those like, people
who paint nails and stuff

387
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:47,260
because you would get a chance
to tell them about the Lord.

388
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,462
I mean, just relaxing
Christian music in the background.

389
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:52,906
You know, doing it.
You know what I mean?

390
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:56,434
It would just be really relaxing
and they would just be able to--

391
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:59,522
they won't have
many walls at that second.

392
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:02,058
They would just be able
to accept, you know?

393
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:08,766
I've been teased several times
and I just thought to myself,

394
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:13,824
"Man's decision? Whatever!
God's decision. Something!"

395
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,209
They think I'm weird, go ahead.

396
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:18,379
"You're not the ones
who are gonna be judging me

397
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:21,126
if I'm going to hell or heaven.

398
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,307
God is. It matters what he thinks of me.
Doesn't matter what you think."

[music playing]

402
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:58,712
This is my favorite part.

403
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:24,766
My favorite kind of music
is like Christian heavy metal,

404
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:26,901
rock and roll.

405
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:29,874
It focuses in the basis
towards Jesus

406
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:35,535
and some of the songs don't actually
say like "Jesus" or "Our Lord"

407
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:36,534
or stuff like that.

408
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:40,188
But they do have a Christian basis
and it is focused towards him

409
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:43,642
so that's why I like Christian and, but--

410
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:49,079
really Britney Spears
and like Lindsay Lohan and stuff

411
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,078
people like that.

412
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:54,311
I could definitely care less about them
because their main --

413
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:59,642
their songs are mainly based
on either like guys or girls and...

414
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:04,368
We as Christians -
I do not believe in that.

415
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,602
[music playing]

416
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:08,005
- Victoria.

417
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,491
- Yeah?

418
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:12,812
- Can you wrap it up in about five minutes
so I can feed you, lunch.

419
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:13,811
- Yeah.

420
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:20,570
- When I dance, I really have to make sure
that that's God because people will notice

421
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,730
when I'm just dancing for the flesh
and I do that sometimes.

422
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:30,708
I must admit that and I really need
to get over that.

423
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:33,902
I'm not the, I'm not the only one
who makes makes that--

424
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:39,371
People out there, they're not the only one
who makes that mistake.

425

- Can you have a cookie?
You can have a cookie.

426

- Can I have a cookie?

before we get on to something else.

Jenny. Christian.
Will you stand up please? Okay.

430
00:25:56,693 --> 00:26:00,497
[together] I pledge allegiance
to the Christian flag,

431
00:26:00,497 --> 00:26:04,399
to the Savior, to his Kingdom it stands.

432

One brotherhood, uniting all Christians
in idea and in love.

433
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:11,922
- Okay. Put your hand on the bible.

434
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:16,632
[together] I pledge allegiance
to the Bible, God's holy word.

435
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:20,145
I will make it a lamp unto my feet
and a light unto my path.

436
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:24,520
I will hide it's word in my heart
that I might not sin against God.

437
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:25,583
- Here.

438
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,435
- Very good everybody.

439
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:31,310
I look at it, and George does too,

440
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,325
our children are on loan
to us from God and someday,

441
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:37,629
we're gonna have to answer to God
about how we raised our children.

442
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:40,653
I'm like,

443
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:42,892
"Lord, you've given me this daughter

444
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:46,553
and how am I supposed to train her?
What am I supposed to do now?"

445
00:26:46,553 --> 00:26:52,212
Right? I bring her to places where
she can learn this, from Becky,

446
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:55,694
from Pastor Care, from different people.
But the Lord told me what you need

447
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:58,452
to train her and is to train
her about character.

448
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:02,631
- Where are you going?

449
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:04,279
- I just have stand out in the rain.

450
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,738
- Okay. Okay, you stood on the rain.

451
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:09,085
- I didn't get wet yet.

452
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,289
- Well, I don't want you
to get soaking wet.

453
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:19,325
Victoria, turn around
and go back inside now. Thanks!

454
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:20,343
- Eight, nine, ten.

455
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:23,548
Okay, I got to get hit 10 times
by drops of rain because I'm 10 years old.

00:27:43,755 --> 00:27:45,169

Tory, we need to get out
your sleeping bag.

463

a pen and a notebook.

to destroy our lives.

The first tactic that he uses
is to tempt you with sin.

00:40:14,543 --> 00:40:18,136
they learn by demonstration,
they learn by modelling.

629
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:21,897
So, here's our Adam and Eve,
ain't that great?

630
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:25,874
Just a good old Ken and Barbie doll,
and so we talk about how they walked

631
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:31,292
and talked in the Garden of Eden with God
but when God breathed into Man,

632
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:34,485
into his nostrils, the breath of life...

633
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:36,743
[whoosh]

634
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:39,638
At that point, Man became a living soul.

635
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:41,395
Now, I tell the kids,

636
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:45,785
if you want to become a stronger Christian
and have your Spirit Man be strong,

637
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:50,594
there's certain things you need to do.
If you pray everyday,

638
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,689
[whoosh]

639
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:53,706
your Spirit Man will get stronger.

640
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:56,388
If you go to church
and learn more about God.

641
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:57,708
[whoosh]

642
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,898
You're spirit is gonna get stronger.
If you don't read the Bible,

643
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,376
come on, its gotta speak.

644
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:05,675

You're spirit will get weaker.

So...For instance,
we have a brain mold

648
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:14,873
because one of the sessions
is gonna be talking about our minds

649
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,829
and how they need to be renewed
towards the word of God.

650
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:20,005
This is really fun
because you can make a Jello-O mold

651
00:41:20,005 --> 00:41:22,313
that looks like a brain
and then you just talk about

652
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,654
how things stick to our minds.

653
00:41:24,654 --> 00:41:29,290
We use this sticky fingers and so
this would represent dirty thoughts.

654
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,910
This would represent swear words.

655
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,947
This would represent things
that we've seen on T. V.

656
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:38,154
or whatever that we've heard
and it sticks to our minds

657
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:40,611
and then you're supposed to slap it--
Woops.

658
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:41,610
- On the brain?

659
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,823
- I don't know if it slaps--
if it's gonna stick very good

660
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,493
but, well, there, it's sticking to the--
there, it sticks to your brain

661
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,896
and that's very effective for kids.

662
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:52,060
So, I mean there's different things
that we've gotten but that's what I do.

663
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,200
I just go look around,
I walk around the toy section of stores

664
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,594
or I'll see something and I'll go,
"That really would work good for..."

665
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:02,787
You know, so, I come at it
with 20 object lessons

666
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,985
and I preach for an hour, you know.

667
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:07,006

"Preaching to an hour for kids,"

669
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:12,327
and they feel sorry for the kids.
You don't need to feel sorry for my kids.

00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,384
[kids cheering]

783
00:49:07,384 --> 00:49:11,902
- Love America.
__ inspire in the world.

784
00:49:11,902 --> 00:49:14,111
In the world!

785
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:16,411
[shattering glass]

786
00:49:21,951 --> 00:49:24,959
- Jesus!

787
00:49:26,558 --> 00:49:31,068
[together] Jesus!

788
00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:42,222
- Press in, kids. Press in.
Unlike McDonalds,

789
00:49:42,222 --> 00:49:46,770
this is not about how fast
you can go through the drive through.

790
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:53,551
You want something from God,
you gonna have to cook a little.

791
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:03,940
You need to stay in the pot
and let him simmer you in the Holy Ghost.

792
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:11,174
- If God touched you tonight,
I wanna hear about it.

793
00:50:11,952 --> 00:50:14,644
Somebody can tell me what happened.

794
00:50:16,036 --> 00:50:17,035
- Pray it out, Tory.

795
00:50:17,035 --> 00:50:18,034
- Pray it out.

796
00:50:18,034 --> 00:50:19,033
- Take them out, Tory.

797
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:21,920
- Jesus, help us break the chain
over our nation.

798
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,336
We break the bondage's that --

799
00:50:26,258 --> 00:50:29,694
and we proclaim in the line of Judea.

800
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,381
[people cheering]

801
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:48,764
Take these prophecies
and do what the apostle Paul said

802
00:50:48,764 --> 00:50:51,473
and make war with them.

803
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:56,479
[music playing]

804
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:12,007
This means war! This means war!
This means war!

805
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,832
Are you a part of it or not?

806
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,852
[squeaking metal]

807
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:52,043
- Tory, over there.
Sorry, I like to throw rocks.

808
00:51:52,043 --> 00:51:55,077
- Okay, Levi, Levi, Levi.

809
00:51:58,863 --> 00:52:02,443
- Whenever I run into a non-Christian
something you know I always...

810
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,642
... You know, there's always something
that doesn't seem right.

811
00:52:07,772 --> 00:52:12,218
There's always something
that makes me feel,

812
00:52:12,218 --> 00:52:14,234
my Spirit feel yucky, you know?

813
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:17,310
This world, all it feeds you is trash.

814
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:23,270
It's like giving out candy
but I don't want candy.

815
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:27,516
I want the meat. The Holy Spirit
is like the meat, good food, you know?

816
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:30,419
The food that you need
and stuff that is good,

817
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,080
but then, candy would just make you sick.

818
00:52:33,603 --> 00:52:36,159
That's what a lot of people
in this world are, they're sick.

819
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:38,488
They're looking for something.

820
00:52:39,716 --> 00:52:44,068
[music playing]

821
00:52:51,058 --> 00:52:54,840
- There's a big huge spider back there.
I am not going back there.

822
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,891
- Move over and let me see, where?

823
00:52:56,951 --> 00:52:58,603
- I'll find it.

824
00:52:58,603 --> 00:53:00,356
- Thanks, show me.

825
00:53:00,986 --> 00:53:02,692
- See it?

826
00:53:02,692 --> 00:53:04,534
- You see how big that bug is, Luke?

827
00:53:04,534 --> 00:53:06,112
- No. It's disgusting.

828
00:53:06,372 --> 00:53:07,647
[laughs]

829
00:53:08,445 --> 00:53:11,654
I do think I'm different from other kids
because we know Jesus.

830
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:13,451
And we're hungering after Jesus,
you know?

831
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:16,637
But you know what,
I wouldn't be different from other kids

832
00:53:16,637 --> 00:53:19,430
if everybody did their calling.

833
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:25,978
That's the thing with America.
America, you know, is supposed to be

834
00:53:25,978 --> 00:53:27,527
"God's Nation," right?

835
00:53:27,527 --> 00:53:31,632
But then, things just kind of
started twisting around, you know?

836
00:53:32,602 --> 00:53:36,498
Now, a lot of people in America
are just not following God.

837
00:53:41,915 --> 00:53:46,329
[people talking]

838
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:53,035
Okay. We're gonna welcome
Mister President now.

839
00:53:56,797 --> 00:53:58,268
Talk to him.

840
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,228
Say, "Welcome, welcome President Bush."

841
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:02,907
[together] Welcome President Bush.

842
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:03,906
We're glad you're here.

843
00:54:03,906 --> 00:54:05,615
[together] We're glad you're here.

844
00:54:05,615 --> 00:54:08,253
I want you to bless him.
Speak a blessing to him.

845
00:54:08,253 --> 00:54:09,252
Would you do that?

846
00:54:09,252 --> 00:54:11,039
Reach out and speak a blessing to him.

847
00:54:11,227 --> 00:54:13,042
[people talking]

848
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:16,365
Do some -- over him.

849
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,674
[foreign language]

850
00:54:20,013 --> 00:54:23,087
He has surrounded himself
with Spirit filled people.

851
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:27,810
So, pray in the Spirit over him.
Here he is!

852
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:34,056
He's come to visit us.
Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

853
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:38,146
Tell him, Mister President.

854
00:54:38,146 --> 00:54:39,519
[together] Mister President.

855
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:41,293
One nation under God.

856
00:54:41,293 --> 00:54:47,319
[together] Mister President.
One nation under God!

857
00:54:47,391 --> 00:54:51,540
[audience clapping and cheering]

858
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:01,908
- Things flew fast, didn't they?

859
00:55:01,908 --> 00:55:02,907
- Yeah.

860
00:55:02,907 --> 00:55:07,956
- They did. They just flew by
and this is the big night.

861
00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:09,001
- Yeah.

862
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,653
- Yeah! Are you ready?

863
00:55:11,051 --> 00:55:12,073
[together] Yeah.

864
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:14,883
- We've got some good surprises
for you tonight, all right?

865
00:55:14,883 --> 00:55:16,951
Hey, I want everybody sitting down,
hands full and smiling faces,

866
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:18,902
looking right this way.

867
00:55:19,597 --> 00:55:22,245
[clapping]

868
00:55:22,462 --> 00:55:24,252
- How are you guys?

869
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,617
- I'm very excited tonight.
I usually talk to big people

870
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:32,056
but tonight I get to talk, maybe,

871
00:55:32,056 --> 00:55:36,161
to the most important generation
in American history.

872
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:40,002
Whoa! And I'm not just joking.

873
00:55:40,885 --> 00:55:44,218
Who was the young man,
the young man with the long hair?

874
00:55:44,218 --> 00:55:46,480
Right there. Come here, son.

875
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:50,623
Just stand right with me.
What's your name?

876
00:55:50,623 --> 00:55:51,797
- My name is Levi.

877
00:55:51,797 --> 00:55:55,312
- Levi? Well, that's a great name Levi.

878
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:57,634
You like Levi's name?

879
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,713
[together] Yeah!

880
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:05,947
Here's the deal.
Before you were born, God knew you.

881
00:56:06,347 --> 00:56:08,884
Extraordinary. He said this.

882
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:12,433
He said he formed you
in your mother's womb.

883
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,763
You're not just a piece of protoplasm.
Whatever that is.

884
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:17,377
[kids laughing]

885
00:56:17,604 --> 00:56:20,369
Not just a piece of tissue
in your mother's womb.

886
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:24,530
You are created intricately by God.

887
00:56:25,127 --> 00:56:27,629
[children laughing]

888
00:56:27,998 --> 00:56:32,510
Is that incredible!
God wrote a book about your life

889
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:39,828
and he wrote "Levi. Levi would be
a God seeker from an early age

890
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,511
and he would become a voice
that touched America.

891
00:56:45,466 --> 00:56:47,294
- Yeah!

892
00:56:47,775 --> 00:56:51,138
- And he would not sell out
in his teenage years.

893
00:56:51,138 --> 00:56:55,006
He would go for God all those days
and he'd be a man of prayer

894
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:59,865
and in his 20s, he'd begin to shake
things real strong for God in the nation.

895
00:57:01,693 --> 00:57:05,876
God's dream. The novel of Levi's life.

896
00:57:07,676 --> 00:57:09,047
Signed, God.

897
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,546
What do you think of that?

898
00:57:10,546 --> 00:57:11,545
- That's pretty cool!

899
00:57:11,545 --> 00:57:12,553
- Pretty cool, huh?

900
00:57:12,553 --> 00:57:13,552
[people laughing]

901
00:57:13,552 --> 00:57:14,551
- Your pretty cool.

902
00:57:14,551 --> 00:57:16,502
[audience clapping]

903
00:57:19,278 --> 00:57:21,554
Now listen to me, guys.

904
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:28,601
Since 1973, up to 50 million babies
never had a chance to fulfill the dreams

905
00:57:28,601 --> 00:57:32,538
God had for their lives.
That's sad, isn't it?

906
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:35,578
Do you know a third of your friends,

907
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:38,585
could be here tonight
but they never made it.

908
00:57:39,698 --> 00:57:46,408
A person is a person, no matter how small.

909
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:51,630
God has a dream for them
like he has a dream for you.

910
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,810
Do you see that?

911
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:58,088
It's kind of awesome, isn't it?
Look at that. 7 weeks old.

912
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:03,594
Tonight, I believe something is gonna
start tonight that can change America.

913
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,418
Seriously.

914
00:58:05,418 --> 00:58:07,473
Kids, I believe that you are
the beginnings

915
00:58:07,473 --> 00:58:10,838
of a movement that can raise up
a moral outcry,

916
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:13,733
that can overthrow abortion in America
and could turn this.

917
00:58:13,764 --> 00:58:16,532
Would you like to be a part
of that kind of company?

918
00:58:16,649 --> 00:58:18,581
[together] Yeah!

919
00:58:19,036 --> 00:58:21,210
[audience clapping]

920
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:28,146
I'm sorry.

921
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:41,566
[together] Jesus, I plead your blood
over my sins and the sins of my nation.

922
00:58:42,055 --> 00:58:46,221
God end abortion
and send revival to America.

923
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:47,220
Louder.

924
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:52,010
[together] Jesus, I plead your blood
over my sins and the sins of my nation.

925
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:56,340
God end abortion
and send revival to America.

926
00:58:56,784 --> 00:59:01,211
- Life! Life ! We command lifeline,
in the name of Jesus. Life!

927
00:59:01,211 --> 00:59:03,671
- Satan in Jesus name, you let go of them.

928
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:09,287
You have no power taking people's lives.
Only God has that power.

929
00:59:09,814 --> 00:59:14,178
- No more Lord. No more! No more!

930
00:59:15,294 --> 00:59:17,056
No more!

931
00:59:17,056 --> 00:59:19,380
[audience clapping]

932
00:59:21,694 --> 00:59:27,175
- Adults! We cry out to God.
32 years to love!

933
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:30,293
God we're asking
for the course of America!

934
00:59:30,722 --> 00:59:32,172
We're asking "Shift the course!"

935
00:59:32,172 --> 00:59:35,616
Raise that righteous judges
who will rule

936
00:59:35,616 --> 00:59:37,870
in behalf of your voice, God.

937
00:59:39,395 --> 00:59:43,130
Righteous judges!
Righteous judges!

938
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,586
Righteous judges!

939
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,224
[together] Righteous judges!
Righteous judges!

940

- I'm doing very good.

1158
01:14:41,114 --> 01:14:44,809
- Why kids? Why are they supposed to be
some new Army of God.

Why are we using kids to do that?

1160
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,848
- Anyone who does any work with kids
know it's because the reason

1161
01:14:49,848 --> 01:14:53,174
you go for kids is because
whatever they learn by the time

1162
01:14:53,174 --> 01:14:56,269
they're 7, 8, 9 years old
is pretty well there

This is the statistics

- No, I know these statistic
but you use the term, "Learn."

1166
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:08,401
The word "learn" is different
than "indoctrinate." God gave us a brain.

1167
01:15:08,401 --> 01:15:13,644
God gave us the freedom to choose
and learning is part of that choice.

1168
01:15:13,644 --> 01:15:16,589
I think that everytime
the fundamentalist movement, Becky,

1169

your question to me was,

1173
01:15:27,799 --> 01:15:29,428
do you feel its right
for the fundamentalist

with their own beliefs.

1175
01:15:32,838 --> 01:15:35,843
I guess fundamentally-- yes I do!
Because every other religion

1176
01:15:35,843 --> 01:15:38,305

I'm not going after my kids politically
but that, you know,

and I don't have problems saying
to my children,

1193

"We are Pro Life."

what's always set this country apart,

1200
01:16:44,511 --> 01:16:48,005
is because there is something that we call

1201
01:16:48,005 --> 01:16:50,658
"A separation between Church and State."

1202

That's always something

1212

1213

on Earth but that's just it.

1214
01:17:20,617 --> 01:17:25,207
It's just what's on Earth
and it's ultimately designed to

1215
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:28,530
destroy itself because we have
to give everyone equal freedom
