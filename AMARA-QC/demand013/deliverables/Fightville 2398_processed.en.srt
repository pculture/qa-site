<i>You know you can be in any weight class.</i>

157
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,315
<i>There was no rules at all</i>

158
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,576
But the way that the sports 
developed since then.

159
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:24,264
You know it's very... 
one of the safest sports around.

160
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,854
<i>Rodeo's, people die you know. </i>
all the time, in rodeos

161
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:29,876
<i>They die in NASCAR. All the time</i>

162
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:32,450
<i>But because this is a new sport</i>
 people don't know what it is

163
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,144
<i>And they see so much blood, </i>
they don't understand.

164
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:37,317
Blood is superficial. 
These guys has four ounce gloves on.

165
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:38,225
<i>They don't have 16 ounce gloves on.</i>
[Thud!]

166
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:39,793
<i>So there's no brain damage.</i>

167
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:41,553
<i>They're getting punched </i>
with a 4 ounce glove.

168
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:45,186
<i>If a guy in the ring is hurt, </i>
the referee will stop the fight.

169
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:46,723
<i>That won't happen in boxing.</i>

170
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:49,411
<i>His hierarchy has to be on the ground </i>
he can even be hurt.

171
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,691
<i>So as long as he can stand himself up</i>
<i>He could continue to fight.</i>

172
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,422
<i>And that doesn't happen in MMA either.</i>

173

that he was a former boxer.

174
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,004
<i>That he wrestled also, Pro, </i>
which I thought was insane.

<i>And you know he's gonna fight one day.</i>

180

182

I will not be able to stop him.

<i>And comes back </i>
much better, much better.

186

There's a lot of skill involved.

187
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:43,469
It's not just some, you know, bar fight.

188

"I wanna fight" , "I wanna fight"
"I wanna fight"

190
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,707
Well, if you're not trained. 
You know we can't put you in there.

191
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:49,316
It's not safe.

But you still not gonna fight on my show.

193
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:55,030
A lot of these kids that call me up.

194
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,274
Wanting to fight, 
think they first have the ability.

195
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:01,282
Then they think it's just, it's easy. 
Let's go and do it

196
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:04,095
So, I as a 38,39 year old man

197
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,386
The first thing I do
is go to the gym and I'll spar 'em.

198

[swoosh] [ thud, thud]

Five guys walking off the street, 
I'm looking for one thing,

200
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:17,497
all of them wanna be 
world champion.

201
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:21,410
But the most important thing is, 
<i>Dedication</i>

-<i>[Tim] Don't commit to run.</i>

205
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:31,114
<i>Commit to the exchange.</i>
 You're committing to not getting hurt.

206
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:34,190
- <i>[Albert Stainback] Actually, quite </i>
afraid of being hit when I'm in the gym.

207
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,968
<i>It sucks! You know you feel it.</i>

208
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:40,862
<i>But when I'm fighting, I just wanna </i>
hit 'em and it just happens.

209
00:11:40,862 --> 00:11:45,406
<i>And I hit them. And they fall </i>
unconscious and I feel good.

210
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:49,924
<i>The energy in the cage makes</i>
 the whole thing feel spiritual for me.

211
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:51,852
Like another world

212
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:54,219
It's almost like the universe 
is this big machine.

213
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:56,830
And I am, you know, I'm operating it.

214
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,131
I don't believe in God.

215
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:59,208
I don't believe in destiny.

216
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,498
I don't believe in predetermination 
or whatever anything like that.

217
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:08,328
But I will say I am dazzled 
by the way I look at my life,

218
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,654
the way it's turned out and the way it's 
just like interconnected with fighting

219
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,693
the way I feel it is.

220
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:18,910
It's the only thing that I really think 
I'm good at, if anything.

221
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,514
You know if you could say 
I'm good at anything, it would be that.

222
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:21,519
- <i>[Gil] Guy's got a lot of talent.</i>

223

<i>He's not a bad looking kid. </i>

224
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:26,101
<i>But I see potential in him </i>
outside of fighting.

225
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:28,352

put himself to anything.

<i>He can do anything, he wanted to do.</i>

227

- [Albert] I kinda wanted to be my 
only option.

228
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,135
Cause I love it that much.

229
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,846
Maybe that's a little fool hearted, 
but I don't care.

230
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:38,550
- [Gil] Many mistakes 
that a young fighter are making.

231
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,254
I guess, the most important one.

232
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,636
Is that they're forgetting. 
That there's life after fighting.

233
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:45,881
Pursuing that MMA dream.

234
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,507
You know I can't fault anybody for that.

235
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:51,347
Because I pursued my own dream. 
But I did work at the same time.

236
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:53,359
I went to college at the same time.

237
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,007
You don't understood 
the sheer dynamics of it.

238
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:59,564
Most fighters 99% of fighters 
end up broken and destitute.

239
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:02,745
That's just the truth of it.

240
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:04,864
They might make a little bit of money 
here and there.

241
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,492
But most fighters, most people 
climbing into the ring or the cage

242
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:08,778
don't make a penny.

the best you can

So what can I do?

Is something very important for a fight.

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,135
And yes I do practice in the mirror

262
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:14,074
I'll sit in the mirror in the bathroom 
and just be like. [deep breathing]

263
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:16,783
If you're staring them down

And you see that certain look

265
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:21,777
I believed that you know, 
you're already in their head.

00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:24,621
And that, and that helps.
You know.

267

But then you get those people, 
and this is when you know

268
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,156
It's gonna be a fight.

269
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:31,087
When they just look 
right back at you dude...

And it's a..
I like those even better actually.

271
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:35,287
I like it when they grind,
you know, right back.

272
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:37,416
When they are not scared.

273
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,667
When they do not back down. I love it!

274
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,206

way when they get in the cage.

00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:45,629
But other people in the outside
don't really notice it how,

how peaceful it really is inside there.

It's crazy, so pure.

with Dinero Sports Marketing.

lose this fight?

That's putting pressure on me thinking
about that.

1076
01:03:55,692 --> 01:03:57,190
That's why, if I lose this fight,

1077
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,400
is my manager gonna say,

1078

even tougher guys now."
