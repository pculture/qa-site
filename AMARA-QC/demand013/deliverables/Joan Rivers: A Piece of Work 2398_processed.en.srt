00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- This is my career.
How depressing is this?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughter]

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forty years in 
the fucking business

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and this is where you end up.
[audience laughter]

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just to show you...
[audience laughter]

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My daughter and I are very close;
very, very close.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I brought her up all wrong.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I brought her up to have morals.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She turned down doing 
Playboy magazine cover,

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
how about that?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Four hundred thousand dollars,
naked to the waist.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turned it fuckin' down
and calls me up for approval.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For approval!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
"Mother, I turned down
Playboy. What do you think?"

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you know, what do I think?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very proud of you, Melissa.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I think?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I think,
you stupid, fucking cunt!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I think?
[audience laughter]

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you should ask
200,000 more

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and show your pussy! 
That's what I think!

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[audience applause and laughter]

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a 75 year old woman
I'll be playing the drums in Queens!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I think?
[audience laughter]

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm on a fucking red carpet
in the hot sun

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
talking to these assholes
where are you from?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got a lucky charm.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who the fuck are you?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[audience applause and laughter]

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music]

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Not good. This is not good.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We have no Vegas, no giant club date.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kathy Griffin's taken all 
those away.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have the play, which is
not going to give me any money.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can we get club dates?
Can't Billy get club dates?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this is not a full book.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Like a little date here and there.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Yeah.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Sure.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- These were the good years.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- These were the good years.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- See this is the kind of a book I like.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now that's a good page.
You know what I mean?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ten o'clock, eleven o'clock.
Twelve thirty, this and that.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's happiness.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last year was a very difficult year.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was playing Here We Go,
the Bronx at 4:30 in the afternoon.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That was a real good one.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll show you fear.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's fear.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If my book ever looked like this,
it would mean that nobody wants me,

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That everything I ever tried to do
in life didn't work.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody cared and I've been 
totally forgotten.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- When you say Joan, get out your 
calendar she says hold on on

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
let me put my sunglasses on
because the white of the page

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
hurts my eyes.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, that's a joke. 
So we used to laugh at that.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
"Hold on, let me get my sunglasses."

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, what day?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look handsome.
Yeah right.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Billy looks good and he can't
stand it. I can't.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?
My career is in the toliet

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's me.
My career is in the toilet

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
nothing is going right,

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that's right

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know it's like
ya know?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I always 
tell them.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That still gets me.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Billy Sabbath is a big
part of my life

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
a huge part of my life.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He knows my history
there are so few people

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that you can say, do you
remember Bernie Billstein

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and we both laugh
and laugh.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Joan is a chronic
workaholic.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-one job a day is not 
enough it's almost like

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
an addict.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sadly, but she's a 
work addict

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-so it's not enough no 
matter how much you

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
give her it doesn't
fill up that need to

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-be working.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now this is Joslin Picket,
this is my assistant

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
who is not going to 
show you how busy I am.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anybody call?
No.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not about whether
the talent is good

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-it's about whether
they're hot.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There are times in 
people's careers

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that you just can't 
get it going.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Careers do that, you're
hot, you're not,

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you're in a slump
you're not.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing is happening
right now, so she

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-needs some heat.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Steve Laean's office.
Jennifer Mowen

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi Billy Sabbath.
-and Joan Rivers.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi Joan Rivers, hold
on just a moment.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Hello. 
I's get through

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-faster if I was
Kathy Griffin.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Hello. Hi.
Let's hear about Harrod's

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-which is May 18th which the
weekend before Memorial Day.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just think it's
wrong.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not vacation,
the kids are still

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-in school. 
I want a letter from

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-from them saying we
acknowledge the worst

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-weekend, one of the
worst weekends of the

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-year. 
And i really don't

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-need at this age, when
I'm a comedy icon

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I don't need to walk
into a room and have

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-it half full and 
then have the

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Harris people go
cluck, cluck, cluck.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right now they see her
as a plastic surgery

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-freak who's past due
her, you know, her

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-sell by date. 
Who's finished.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But God help the next
Queen of Comedy

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-because this one is
not abdicating.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never will. There will
be nail marks on that

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-red carpet before she
abdicates.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So good luck to the
next Queen.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy Birthday to you.
Happy Birthday to you.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Age is the one mountain
that you can't overcome.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a youth society and
nobody wants you. Your too

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-old, you're too old. 
If one more woman

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-comedian comes to me
and says to me, you opened

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
the doors for me and you
want to say,

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-go fuck yourself. 
I'm still opening the

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-doors. 
Thank you very much.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You are a Barnard College
graduate ? Yes.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And your father's a 
doctor. Yes.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You live, where? 
Scarsdale?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In Large Mouth.
In Large Mouth.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And your mother is a?
A mother.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a mother. 
[audience laughs].

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do they look upon
this, what you're doing?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What it is that you do?
Frightened.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[audience laughs]

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well now they are very
show biz.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And my mother and I
are thinking of doing

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a sister act. But ummm
[audience laughs].

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The audience here really
liked ya and good luck

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to ya. 
[clapping].

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joan here is a script
for the TV pilot, you

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-wanted to look at.
Ok, do you know where

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I am in this?
[phone ringing].

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see no Joan on page 2,
I see no Joan on page 3.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see no Joan on page 4.
[laughs].

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have worked with her
for about 15 years,

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think, somewhere in
there, so I definately

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-have gone through kind
of the ups and downs,

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you know with her career.
When I started it was

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
definitely kind of a
lower point,

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-her daytime talk show,
was cancelled at the

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-same time her play,
Sally Mar which ran on

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Broad Way. That shut
down. Everything was

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
kind of closing at that
point.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So of course Joan
being Joan started

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
to reinvent herself.
No, I ain't seeing me.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This year is no 
different.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joan is looking at
new projects,

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-new ways to get out
there.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's got 2 new books
coming out.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A new play that she's
really worked very hard

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
for the past couple 
of years.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Celebrity Apprentice,
she's booked to be on the

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
next series of 
Celebrity Apprentice.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she's hoping one of
them hits and puts her

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
back on top.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't find me
anywhere.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[horns blowing].

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What we are planning is
the cut-off date for

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the Tony Nominations
is somewhere in April,

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-so we have to open
somewhere in April.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The next few months
I am really focusing

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-just on my play.
It means a great deal

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to me because it tells
my life story.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she calls me up 
and she goes

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Billy its Joan, listen
I wrote a script a

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
couple of years ago,
it's in the drawer.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I actually saw a reading 
of it a year earlier

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and I enjoyed it. 
So I said I think

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you should do it.
Hi Joanie.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi Billy boy.
[kissing].

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[background conversations]

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Schmidtie, how you doing?
Schmidt Schmidt, Schmidt

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The name of the show is
Joan Rivers -

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A Work in Progress by
A Life in Progress.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Episodes from her life.
How she got to where she

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-is now. We're going to
take this to the

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Edmonds Festival, and
then we're going to do

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-it in London's Glittering
West End.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The ultimate goal, I think
Joan wants to play it

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-in her home town.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have very few hairs left
on my head and each one has

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a name, like last week
we Shiva for Bernice.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We buried Bernice.
We cremated Bernice.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah cremated Bernice.
I hope that the play

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-is a huge success. 
I think the play will

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-remind them I am an
actress, I'm a writer.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if we get great
reviews,

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-it will open up a million other 
things.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of my earliest
memories must have been

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-top 6 years old, my 
mother took me to see

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Paul Ropes in Longfellow and
I remember smelling the smells

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-of the theater and I
thought, this is where

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I belong. 
I was in every school

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-play. I was in 
everything that you could

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-do in college. I was never a
discussion in my own head

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
of where I was going.
I was always acting.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was always going to 
be an actress.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were straight acting
or comedy, or --

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, no comedy never.
I just knew that I

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-could work the comedian
at night and make money to

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-make the rounds as an
actress. And that's the

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
only reason I went 
into comedy.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes I sit at 
home and I think to

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-myself, Joan, yes 
your're a diva,

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you're a diva. 
Penthouse, limos,

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-furs, woof, woof.
But a diva can get

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-lonely. And I say this
to my staff. I say, staff

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughter].
I don't learn their

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-names like you people
they come, they go.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes I say to them
staff, I'm lonely.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's going to fuck
me tonight?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughter].
Yes, yes, yes,

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-this is delicious, huh?
This is Kevin who runs

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
my house also, without
asking me anything.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank God. That is
Debbie, his wife,

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-over there who is really
the brains behind Kevin

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-just thought you should
know.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's bacon, you idiot.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is my apartment and it's
very grand. This is how

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Marie Antoinette would 
have lived if she had

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-had money.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You try to explain to 
people before you go to

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-nobody lives like this.
Maybe the Queen of England.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-but besides that, nobody
lives like this.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I live very very very 
well. That's to start

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-with. I enjoy my
creature comforts and

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I know I have to work for
it. I could stop and live

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-carefully, but that's 
ridiculous, I don't want

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to live carefully. So I
would rather work and live

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the way I live at one
whole time.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I hear the numbers
from her accountant,

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you know behind our client's
back everyone is whispering

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-so they called and said
Billy, you got a pull

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-another rabbit out of the
hat. How many rabbits would

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you like out of the hat?
I don't have that many more

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-rabbits in my hat. 
When I first hit on

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-The Carson Show, years
ago, my manager was a man

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-named Jack Rollins and he
said you're going to be

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-an industry.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When people hit, they 
become industries and

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that's really it, I'm a
small industry.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Checks for you to sign.
Oh good, okay.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have an agent, I have 
a manager, I have a

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-business manager, 
a PR lady, 2 assistants,

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and a lawyer. 
Don't forget the lawyers.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There are then,
relatives that I'm

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-totally supporting.
Certain friends, most

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-people that work with me
if they have children

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I send the children to 
private schools.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It goes on, on, on, on
and on.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm dancing as fast as
I can.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you on speaker?
I am.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So where do we start?
Joan they want you for

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
125,000 dollars for 3 days, 
where you can

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-tie it in and sell your
jewelry. Should I sign it?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes I'd love to, because
I'm very short on money.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trust me, we need it.
Okay. Okay.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How about bump up the 
offer and you'll do your

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-comedy. 
Yeah, bump up the offer

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and they get Joan 
on stage.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bump up the offer some
more and they get Joan

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
doing survival lecture and
on stage. Bump up the

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-offer some more and they also
get the red carpet lecture.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The survival lecture. And
don't forget just the

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
125 grand worth of charm.
[laughs]

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[bird singing].

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know the dates we are 
hosting QVC, right Billy?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pretty much. Yeah.
Let me ask you last

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-thing. Do you think it's
in bad taste to say that

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Obama's wife, who I think is
so shiek, Michelle, that she

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-is, remember the old days
the Kennedy Era there was

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the Jackie O? 
Well in the Obama Era

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-it's going to be Blackie O.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh no. Okay just thought
it was a great joke.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These are all my jokes.
These are jokes over the

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-last 30 years.
Every time I write a

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-joke, I try to remember to
put it on a card.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should a woman cook?
So her husband can say

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-my wife makes a delicious
cake to some hooker.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].
And you wonder why I'm still

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-working at this age.
People think it comes so

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-easily, they have no idea
what you're doing is a

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-terrifically difficult thing
to do and I prepare like a

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-crazy lady. 
I mean here I am, everything

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-is just everywhere you 
look, there are jokes.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-jokes to be filed, jokes
to be written, jokes that

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I thought of something.
I mean my life is just

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-jokes.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vagina farts are so loud, my 
gynecologist wears ear plugs.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are gay men proud of their
excessive body hair,

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-like Madonna's daughter.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amazing race, Mel Gibson 
chasing Jews into

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the showers.
[laughs].

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As some of you can tell now,
I'm 7 1/2 months pregnant.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and you want to know the
truth?

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At night when I'm undressed
and my husband looks at me

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and mentally dresses me.
[laughs].

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I started comedy I was
very wild for the time,

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-but different times.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The last line of my original
act was "This business it's

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
all about casting characters.
So I just want you to know my

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-name is Joan Rivers and I
put out.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you would hear the 
audience, such a sweet

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-little silly line from a 
girl who is 28 years old

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you know,dressed up trying
to look nice.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Half of them laughed, Jack
Lemon saw me and walked out.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said that's disgusting. 
So for my time I was very

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-shocking. I remember I had
a joke about abortions when you

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
weren't supposed to even say
the word on television.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have a friend who just got
married. The woman is

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-32 years old, she had 14
appendectomies, if you know

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-what I'm telling you.
You know,back and forth

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to Puerto Rico, she never 
stopped flying.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She walked down the aisle in 
white. Every usher went --

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My manager took me out and said
to me, Joaniah, you're going

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-into places you shouldn't 
go. It's not right.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Women shouldn't talk about that.
I remember thinking you are

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-so wrong. 
This exactly what we should

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-be talking about.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My daughter loves me very 
very much.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was there when she gave
birth, uck.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In California they bring the
parents in to see the birth.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uck, uck, uck. 
My day having a child

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-was better. 
They knocked you out with

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the first pain. They woke
you up in the hair dresser's

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
show, you knew nothing, it
was so much better.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ms. Rivers you had a girl.
Good, good, good. [laughs].

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is she normal? Yeah. Good. 
Is she white? Yeah. Good.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughing and clapping].

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The marriage continues.
[laughs].

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I went to see her live one time.
The shit that came out of her

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-mouth was so shocking
and so funny, she was

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-doing something, no other
woman was doing.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, I wouldn't be doing
this if it wasn't for Joan.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Much in the way that she
acknowledges Phyllis Diller

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-paved the way for her. And 
before her was Moms Mabley,

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get it, there is a handful
of women in modern history

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-that have done this. 
Just a handful.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was so angry about --
Thank you.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, thank you.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
While we're on the subject
let me talk to you about

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-sex over 60, after 60, the body
drops.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My body, yeah, and it's not
just the breasts.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vaginas drop. 
Six years ago I woke up

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-one morning and I said,
why am I wearing a

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-bunny slipper 
and why is it gray.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Brilliant.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I went to the dermatologist
so please excuse the way

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I look.
[laughs].

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I shot filled with everything.
I said I needed ______.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where did you go?
She just went crazy.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lost her way.
And she said here

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-go to rehearsal.
[laughs].

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, thank you Pat.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My mother told me 
looks don't count.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She told me this a lot.
Saturday nights,

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-in our kitchen 
while I was growing up.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My mother used to look at
me and say [laughs].

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks don't count. Now get
out of my sight, you big lump.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].
And my mother lied because --

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's very scary when you see
yourself totally without any

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-makeup, it's really --
it gives me the willies.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is that person?

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I get up in the morning
and the first thing I do is

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-is I get into makeup.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now I was never the natural
beauty.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No man has ever ever told me
I'm beautiful.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say to me you look great,
you look this, your terrific.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But no man has ever said,
on my God you're so beautiful.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. Bring them right in.
Yeah. Good. Yeah, good.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, let's do tools. 
Yeah, that's great.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, good.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
People want to look at 
pretty women.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody wants an old
woman.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I started with the 
plastic surgery,

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-little bits and tweaks.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then I got very angry,
because nobody

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-would admit it.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really became a big
advocate of it.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then I became the poster
girl for it.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then I became the 
joke of it.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, that's it.
Good.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So how did you come up with
the title?

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mel LaRue told that to me, 
Yeah. At a party.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. Do you remember having
a discussion before we went

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-on the air today?
right.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said if you don't feel good
about yourself on the inside

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-plastic surgery will not help
at all.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And in fact, can make things
worse.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because then you think people
aren't really appreciating

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the real me.

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well who is the real me?
Tell me --

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You are the real me.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We want to be loved for our sense
of humor, for our soul,

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
for our sweetness, 
for our vulnerability,

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
for our intelligence. Yes?

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want to be loved.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music.]

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I met Edgar. 
I had been on the

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Carson Show. 
Edgar called and he said

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to Johnnie, who do you know
who is a good writer?

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Carson said there was a
girl writer on last week.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should look her up.
I met him, I married him

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-four years later.
Was I madly in love

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-with him? No.
Was it a good marriage?

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.
I thought marriage was

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-going to be hugging and
kissing like in the movies.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You walk hand in hand, over
the hill into the sunset.

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what's on the other
side of that hill?

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Filthy dishes, that's what.
And socks.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How the last show last night?
Very good as a matter of fact.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.
Without Edgar I could never

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-have done it.
We worked together.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We worked on projects together
so it was a family business.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Any woman that has a child 
and doesn't yell

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-is a fool, don;t you think?
Didn't you yell?

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not? No.
It's your one chance to

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-be noticed. 
When I was having my

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-kid, you should
[screams}.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughter].

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that was just during
conception.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was dying to be a mother.
I couldn't wait to

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a mother. 
And I really worked very

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-hard to be there for her.
Of course, I'm sure she

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
felt very deserted as a 
child, but I was there as

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-much as I could be and
I made sure we were a

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-family unit and she it.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was it like living with 
a legend?

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like yeah, it was hilarious
when I was getting grounded.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which is why I always say 
to people, you don't

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-realize how in these very
extraordinary abnormal

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-circumstances what a
normal world my parents

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-created. 
And that's a testiment

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to them.
It's funny because she

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-refers to her career as
"THE" career, and it dawned

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-on me one day, I had
a sibling. We all were

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-on "The Career" as if 
it was a totally separate

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-entity in the room.

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Melissa, what was your mom's
reaction when you told her

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you wanted to go into
show business?

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well what was the saying,
supportive,

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-yet not encouraging. 
Yeah, and still am.

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which is a little late in
the game to be supportive

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and not encouraging.
It's such a hard

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-business, what I tried
to do was protect her.

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the one business
in the world, it is total

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-rejection. I'm 75 and I'm
still rejected.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This business you are mud
your whole life.

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[applause].

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Josie Josie, you there?
Yes.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you heard from Billy?
I haven't I have gotten

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-no calls back.
All right, can you

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-send him an email? 
I really want him there

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to see the play before we
go to Edinborough.

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean there's Edinborough,
there's London, my God.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's gotta see the play.
Okay, I'll email him as well.

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's my manager Billy, 
who I adore, disappears

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-all the time.
3 years ago it was very

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-very bad and I almost
fired him then and then

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-your it's God, it's you 
know.

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've known Billy, it's 
gotta be about 35 years.

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could open the drawer 
here somewhere and you'll

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-find pictures of Billy.
Here look, young Billy.

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Young Joan and Edgar in 
the background.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Billy is part of my life and
I want to see him now, because

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-we are doing the play and I
need another pair of eyes,

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need another brain. I need
his input desperately.

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
To what will be Joan River's

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-A Work in Progress, by
a life in progress.

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, here we go.
I am thrilled to be

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-here. I just don't want
this to be about me, me,

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-me, me me. Hey Joan.
Not yet honey.

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Again, you 2 back, 
go back.

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyhow, line, now where 
was I?

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughing and clapping].

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bill Cosby, who is a very 
good friend of mine was on

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the Tonight Show and the
comic that was on with Bill

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-absolutely bombed and Bill, God
bless him went over to the

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-director and he said listen
why don't you use Joan Rivers

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-she can't be any worse
than the guy that was on

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-tonight.

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that's how they put
me on the next night.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And it was one of those
nights. Do you know like

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-when everything goes right?

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When the stars are in 
alignment and the

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-audience we just 
connected.

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Carson at the end of
the act, after 9 years

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-of working bungalow
colonies,and

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-strips joints and working
in Greenwich Village

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-in clubs where you pass
the hat and the hat

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-wouldn't come back.

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the air, Carson said 
to me you're going to be

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a star. 
I looked behind me,

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-who the hell is he
talking to.

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And it was absolutely 
magical between

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the 2 of us, absolutely
magical.

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think men 
really like intelligence

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-more when it comes
right down to it.

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh please, are we 
going to go back

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to that? Are you kidding?
Sure, it's a brain, you

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
know. 
No man has ever

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-put his hand up a
woman's dress

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-looking for library
card.

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone watched the 
Carson Show.

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when Carson said to
me you're going to be a

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-star, my life changed.

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And as they say at Cape
Canaveral, she took off

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-like a rocket.

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Tonight Show was a 
pinnacle for Joan.

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the more guest 
appearances she got,

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-either guesting with 
Johnny or guest hosting

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-for Johnny, the bigger
and stronger the career

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
was going and building up
and up.

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then eventually they 
made her the permanent

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-guest host of 
The Tonight Show

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-which was a big thing.

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After 20 years on The 
Tonight Show,

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fox came and offered me
my own show

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and Edgar would be
the producer.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course we said yes.
The first person I called

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-was Johnny Carson.
He slammed the phone down.

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I called him again, slammed it down
again and never spoke to me

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-again. Ever.
I think he was

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-furious, I think he felt
betrayed.

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was now a competitor. 
He literally had me

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-black listed and to this
day I have not been on

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-NBC late night, ever.

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As she drove off the NBC
lot, she lost her confidence.

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my God, what have I done.
It was such a bad period.

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Fox show even before we
went on the air, was just

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a nightmare. Edgar did not
like Ruben Murdock

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and Barry Gillette and from
the day we walked in.

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There were fights. 
About everything.

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About whichever Coke
machine or a Pepsi

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-machine, M&Ms or Hershey
Kisses.

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Finally they called me in
on a Thursday night and

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-they said you've got to
fire Edgar.

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't do it. 
I couldn't ahhh,

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I couldn't do it. 
I couldn't do it.

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The woman who asked, "Can
we talk?" Joan Rivers is

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
apparently through as 
permanent host of her

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-late night talk show.

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From there, Edgar imploded,
absolutely imploded.

590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't have Joan's 
strength, he didn't

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-have it. 
I had a call from

592
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Gavin DeBecker, who is the
security company.

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He had terrible news. Yes.
Edgar killed himself in

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Philadelphia. 
He left us high and dry.

595
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything went to 
smithereens.

596
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And he left me with no 
career and a lot of debts.

597
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because he wasn't a good
businessman, and ahhh

598
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a lot of tough times.

599
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I walked past Edgar's 
pictures, I feel such

601
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-sadness, such darkness.

602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First off, Mother I'm very
very angry at you.

603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Since Daddy died, you have 
not spent one minute at home.

604
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Melissa and I, we started 
immediately going into

605
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-therapy, separately and
together.

606
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then we did something
which sounds so sick.

607
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We did a movie about
Edgar's suicide where

608
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-we played ourselves.
Are you angry about

609
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-something?
I'm angry about a lot of

610
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-things, okay?
Okay.

611
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It sounds so stupid and
corny, but I think by

612
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-walking through it again
it absolutely mended us.

613
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Totally mended the 
relationship.

614
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't ask, I have to go
to another doctor to

615
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-figure that one out.

616
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

617
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, thank you. 
Have some fun.

618
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you. Thanks again.
[laughing].

619
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joan. Get off your knees.
Oh Joan, I worship you.

620
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get off your knees. 
Joan, Joan, Oh My God.

621
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joan Rivers everybody.
[clapping].

622
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Billy sent me this for
Opening Night.

623
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, wait.
Polly wants a

624
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-fucking cracker. 
Give Polly a

625
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-fucking cracker now.

626
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].

627
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Old lady on the cover.
[laughs].

628
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Young people, young festival,
young ideas, old lady.

629
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get ready. Hottest ticket, isn't that 
great?

630
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the front page.
[cheering and clapping].

631
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The play went beyond my
wildest dreams

632
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-in Edinborough. 
We had great reviews,

633
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the audience adored it.
But who knows what's going

634
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to happen in London.
It can turn on a dime.

635
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[sirens].

636
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are we? 
The signage is going up.

637
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look your canopy 
is going up.

638
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh isn't that sweet.
All right.

639
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is where we'll make
the decision to whether

640
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-or not I'm going to 
try to bring it to

641
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-New York.

642
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh if the reviews are bad,
we're dead.

643
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We finished it and it was
wonderful, but it will

644
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-not go to New York.

645
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joan this is _________
Design.

646
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got a soft pink, I don't care
what it says.

647
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joan didn't want to open the
play in New York or LA

648
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-because even if it's
great, they will not

649
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-give her the Kudos
that it's great.

650
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because of who she is.
There is nothing she

651
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-can do that will be
industry embraced.

652
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much does it hold?
Ahhh 393. So it's 400.

653
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, 400.
I've never in the

654
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-critics drawing. 
I've always been

655
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-considered a comic and a
Bushboy Comic

656
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
or a Vegas Comic.
There is always an

657
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-adjective before my name,
and it's never a nice

658
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-adjective. 
I go back to Fun City

659
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-which was my first play
in 1973 and they were very

660
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
harsh to it.

661
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

662
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was horrible and I will 
not go throug that again.

663
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I moved us out of 
New York.

664
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said when that play closed
we moved right after Fun City.

665
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just think they are not 
going to like us.

666
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I didn't spend all this
time and all this energy to

667
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
have us close and it breaks
my heart to see it die here.

668
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It won't die here. 
That's only that's

669
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-killing me.
I was thinking.

670
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not going to lose it.
We won't let this go.

671
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I know it's your work
of love.

672
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really think it's good.
Okay, onwards and upwards.

673
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

674
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello press, be kind.
Thank you. Hello.

675
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very nervous, I don't want
to go 3 nights.

676
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you should celebrate
second nights,

677
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-when you're a success.

678
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think anyone who celebrates
opening nights is a fool

679
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-because you're not, opening
night is your walk to the

680
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-execution. So I will be
very very happy tomorrow

681
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-if all goes well and very smug.
I will throw some diva scence

682
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-when I know I have 
the power.

683
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right now I don't know if
I have the power.

684
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

685
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that enough glitter?
Yes, oh God yes.

686
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plenty. Plenty of glitter.
[music].

687
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh shut that stupid bitch up.
[applause and shouting].

688
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At the end of the show 
Johnny Carson, on the air

689
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-turned to me and said,
you're going to be a star.

690
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vaginas drop, I did not
know this.

691
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm 75 years old and I tell
you I haven't peaked.

692
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And is why I'm going to go
out that door, the door after

693
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-that, and the door after
that and the door after

694
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that and the door after that.
And I invite all of you,

695
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-come with me. Thank you.
[applause and clapping].

696
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa, okay. That was pretty
extraordinary.

697
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All stood up, 
right at the end.

698
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In America, if it goes out
in America, but you do

699
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-stand up all the time in
shows whether, you know,

700
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-like you're supposed to or
something.

701
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here they don't. 
Except for this show.

702
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it? Not a triumph
until we read it

703
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-in the papers.
Nice triumph.

704
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We love you so much.
Thank you very much.

705
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry. You're not bothering
me. All the love that we

706
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-have here for you.
We'll feel it tomorrow

707
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-after the reviews.
Such a nice audience.

708
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you. Now let me ask
you, when will we find out

709
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-about the reviews?
Tomorrow, first thing

710
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I'm pretty sure they 
fantastic.

711
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does it say? 
Comedy, tragedy,

712
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-surgery and Rivers isn't
going quietly.

713
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

714
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The energy dips slightly
towards the end,

715
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-that is understandable
given the star's age.

716
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They only gave me 3 
stars out of 5. Okay.

717
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's square.
All this play acting

718
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
is an excuse for a night
of me, me, Joan.

719
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She is not short on 
self-pity and a

720
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-passage about her 
relationship with her

721
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-daughter is pretty low
grade smultz, mind you.

722
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know.
So wrong.

723
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Exactly, it ends in a joke
you ass.

724
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Exactly, that's why it was
just not getting it.

725
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Longer exposure to her
even in a small theater

726
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
betrays a husky weakness of
voice that some may find

727
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
monotonous.

728
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm thinking I don't 
want to take this to

729
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
New York while we're sitting
in a taxi in New York in

730
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-6 months, and hear this
and see this again.

731
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. 
I'm not a ______

732
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I don't know.
[music].

733
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am not going to walk in
to New York City and

734
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-be hurt the way Fun City
hurt me.

735
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My acting is my one 
scared thing in my life

736
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and I will not have anyone
hurt me with that.

737
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can say I'm not a good
comedian,

738
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-does't bother me.

739
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You say you didn't like me
as an actress,

740
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-it's killing me.

741
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I don't want that in
New York, but I know I'm

742
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-an actress.

743
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all about acting, the 
career is an actress'

744
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-career.

745
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I play a comedian.

746
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So it's over, it's over. 
No one will ever take me

747
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-seriously as an actress.

748
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[footsteps].

749
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be down-hearted. 
Are you down-hearted?

750
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not down -- I'm just --
it's not what I thought was

751
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-going to happen.

752
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought what was going to 
happen was we were going to

753
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-sail in from Edinborough
everyone was going to love it

754
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and we were going to pick up
a producer and then move it

755
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-forward and change it.
But not like and of course

756
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-there is no Billy around. 
Billy is never around for

757
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-trouble.
Yeah.

758
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This isn't trouble, but 
you know.

759
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Any how. 
[music].

760
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The play if over and it hurts
very much, but I gotta take

761
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a deep breath and start
again.

762
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

763
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[airplane].

764
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It wouldn't kill you to get
me another commercial.

765
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just remember when they come in
and ask for a man, I can be

766
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
very butch.
[laughs].

767
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she will do anything and
really get into it,

768
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-like she loves it.
Okay.

769
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, if nobody has anything
else, I'm very depressed.

770
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye Steve. Bye.

771
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to retire, 
I don't want to

772
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-go sit in the sun, 
I don't want to learn

773
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to garden, 
I paint, who cares?

774
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello Emily Hoe. 
A pleasure to meet you.

775
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Explain to us what you are
offering.

776
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Platinum Rye is hired 
by the ad agencies to

777
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-plug in celebrities to 
different endorsement

778
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
possibilities. Yes.
And they want to have

779
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a meeting with Joan and
where can we put her in.

780
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will do anything. 
I will knock my teeth out,

781
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and do dentasure or 
whatever it is.

782
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, she's done -
I will wear a diaper,

783
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I don't give a shit.

784
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joan has a _______<u> a</u>_______ focus to succeed.

785
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And works at it every day.
I remember once meeting with

786
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Richard Pryor. And I sat
with him, spent an hour with

787
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I said, okay Richard what
we're going to do this,

788
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-we're going to do this,
we;re going to do that,

789
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and we're going to plan 
on this and we're going to

790
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-do that and he looked
at me and he says,

791
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Larry that's all right,
but what the fuck do

792
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-we do Monday.
That's where Joan is.

793
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What the fuck do we 
do Monday.

794
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is this?
That's my thing

795
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I've been reading.
I am holding

796
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-____ of all the people for
the celebrity apprentice

797
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-that we pulled off of 
the Internet.

798
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Randy R-a-n-d-e. 
Turn ons taking in a

799
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-good movie while spending
time with loved ones

800
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and my beautiful puppy,
Mercedes. Awwww.

801
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turn offs negative people who
are unkind and have no

802
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-respect for others.

803
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs]. 
Well she's going to

804
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-hate me.
Yeah, exactly.

805
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm doing Celebrity
Apprentice because

806
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-it's face time on NBC and
NBC has not let me be on NBC

807
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-since the Carson show.
I didn't want her to do it

808
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought it was F Class
people, but it is face time,

809
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-prime time network.
I think they would be

810
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-stupid to put me off the 
first 4 shows, so I may be

811
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-very free the second half
of October.

812
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think they are not going
to throw me off in the

813
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-beginning I'm the only one
that kinda that has a name,

814
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-even though Donald says
these international

815
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-known entrepreneurial 
celebrities.

816
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They had Paul Newman. 
You know Billy I'm going

817
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to say that in the Press
Release that I was told

818
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Paul Newman was going to 
be here. [laughs].

819
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very excited about 
Celebrity Apprentice

820
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-because Melissa, my daughter
is going to be on the show

821
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-with me. 
Which means we will

822
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-have a lot of time to
spend together.

823
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you had your hair done yet?
No.

824
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus fucking Christ 
Melissa, why?

825
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's fine. 
We've got 40 minutes,

826
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-that's more than enough.
That's more than enough.

827
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No it's not.
For my hair it is.

828
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Melissa red-eyed in from LA
this morning and we started

829
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-taping Celebrity Apprentice 
tonight.

830
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got to stop smoking 
immediately.I went to a pulmonary guy

831
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-today. Am I boring you?
No, no, i'm listening.

832
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm down to like 2 for
a day.

833
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm telling you --
I know, be supporive

834
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-that I'm down to that.
He said women reaction

835
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-differently to cigarettes
than men

836
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm down to like 
2 or 3 a day.

837
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said more woman are dying
of lung cancer than

838
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-breast cancer. 
And nobody's discussing

839
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-that.

840
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's very interesting
I'm down to about 2 or 3

841
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a day. So --
Yeah, I'm just telling

842
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you, you're really loading
the gun.

843
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just saying, I know.
I'm just saying I know.

844
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just saying, be 
supportive, I've gotten

845
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-down to that.
He scared the be jesus

846
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-out of me.
Great pressure is

847
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
what if she gets voted off
ahead of me?

848
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's going to be traumatic.
I would rather I get voted

849
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-off ahead of her.
I know, that I will always

850
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-hold back, I know that and
so ahhh cuz I don't want

851
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-ever to come out brighter
than Melissa and smarter

852
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-than Melissa.
I just don't --

853
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't compete with her
at that level.

854
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I believe that _______
and even if I did win

855
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-she'd say she held back, but
I don't think she really could.

856
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, see ya later. 
In the business you've

857
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-have to put yourself
first, you have to

858
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-protect yourself. 
And my mother will tell

859
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you she only wants me to
win and then she'll do

860
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-something without even
realizing it that is very

861
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-destructive.
And I think it's a very

862
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-tough dynamic, because I
think it's completely

863
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-subconscious with her.

864
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Open that.
It's a very nice

865
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
goodie bag.

866
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel very out of place, 
I'm the oldest by far.

867
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They were all talking and chatting
and for a long time I stood by

868
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
myself. 
I feel very isolated.

869
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well I see you also bring a
lot of that on yourself.

870
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't make, like tonight
you don't make any effort

871
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
to be like welcoming. 
I stood there.

872
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well no I'm saying you were on
your Blackberry so fast, and I

873
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
tried to introduce you to people
and you were already Oh hi,

874
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
because you get so shy and that's
people don't know about you.

875
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hell I wouldn't walk over to
you. Well they didn't.

876
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you set it up for that,
you don't realize it, that

877
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you do that sort of thing.

878
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stand ups are innately 
insecure.

879
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you would stand on a stage
by themselves and say laugh

880
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-laugh at me, laugh with me
I don't care and I think that

881
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-is sort of the nature
of the beast

882
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Overall it's just my perception
of growing up comedians

883
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
they are all very damaged,
and they need that

884
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-reassurance, it's all a
cover.

885
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music.]

886
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been a blood bath.
They don't play fair,

887
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-they cheat.
So Melissa is filed

888
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-on Tuesday and I now Joan
was very upset.

889
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She is a snake.
Annie Duke was on the

890
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-team with Melissa and 
absolutely conspired to get

891
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Melissa fired. 
Annie Douch, that fucking

892
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-moron. 
Would you know grab onto

893
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-my log. Yup.
And onto my trailer,

894
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Anne Douch, that moron she
should kiss my ass.

895
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She should kiss my Jewish ass.
But not with those nonkosher

896
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-lips.
Not with those big,

897
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-that's it.
She should kiss my Jewish

898
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-ass, but not with those
big pig lips.

899
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

900
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's too rough?
So tell me, you didn't

901
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-think it was going to 
get vicious?

902
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I just thought it 
was at least going to

903
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-be moderately fair.
And my concern is how

904
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I will be portrayed. 
Because I'm more of a

905
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-of an image issue than
you do.

906
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's a little
unsettling.

907
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It, you're going to look
very angry, they already

908
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-said, when you left you
really called them all

909
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-kinds of names. Um-hmmm.
So that's there.

910
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you all --
Why don't they cut it

911
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to show that I was telling
the truth.

912
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh they are not going to cut
it to show that you were

913
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-telling the truth, because
they don't care, they are

914
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-going to show that you left
pissed off. -pissed off.

915
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you also came back and
you also worked and

916
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you also -- 
that's all right.

917
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm just saying --
I mean it makes you more

918
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-interesting Melissa, 
frankly.

919
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

920
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


921
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have done really an amazing
job. But Melissa, you're fired.

922
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whore, pit vipers. 
I want my and I want it

923
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
now. I'm not leaving
without it.

924
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It makes me very upset to 
see her that hurt.

925
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It wasn't even her -- it was
the frustration of the lies.

926
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's such a cruel business.
Sometimes I just want to say

927
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-why in God's name are you 
opening yourself up to

928
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-such punishment?
Mine is not a choice.

929
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mine is ahhh -- it's like
people always say are

930
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you in the business?
Ask a nun why she's a nun.

931
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's my drive, at 4 in the
morning. I have no choice.

932
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that's where I was from
the time I could figure it out.

933
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No question where I was 
going, there was not drugs,

934
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-no sex, there was no
anything, nothing til I

935
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-got my job. 
That's where I was going.

936
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go away.
[sirens].

937
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music].

938
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're having it's going to be
a long evening.

939
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're doing 2 shows tonight.
Joan Rivers, autograph?

940
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, oh my goodness yes,
of course. I love you.

941
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Every Wednesday night when I'm
in New York

942
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I work at some tiny little
club where I can practice

943
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-my act. 
I just talk about anything

944
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and everything that 
annoys me.

945
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you. 
You don't get the

946
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-recognition you deserve.
Damn right William.

947
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay see, I have a fan.
And William, the minute

948
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-your not angry about things.
The minute you're not upset

949
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-about things.
What are you talking about?

950
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my grandson he's so cute.
That's not my comedy.

951
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm furious about 
everything.

952
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good things don't always
happen to good people,

953
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-and I'm very angry about it.
But I didn't have the anger

954
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-wouldn't be a comedian.
Angry fuels the comedy.

955
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughter].
I hate everybody.

956
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate old people. 
I hate ugly children.

957
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate fat people.
I hated shyness.

958
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate whiners.
I hate dead people.

959
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I even have the 3 wise men
who I hate.

960
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love anal sex, because
you can do other things,

961
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you know. 
it's like, you can iron,

962
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-you can read a book.
[laughing and clapping].

963
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get your emails on the 
Blackberry. {laughs].

964
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[music.].

965
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well right now, we are getting
a 17 foot table up the stairs.

966
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These two guys just walked it
up 7 flights and right here.

967
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Today is Thanksgiving, 
favorite time of the year.

968
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Favorite time of the year.
Lucy and Cooper come of course.

969
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then I invite my friends,
and many of them are strays,

970
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-they are single woman or my
neighbors from downstairs.

971
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's sad. Why is that?

972
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know, sad that you 
seem to have fewer friends

973
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-in New York.
And ahhh, I know when

974
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-something wonderful happens
there maybe 3 people

975
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I'll call. 
Maybe 15 years ago there

976
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-would have been 6 people
I call.

977
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So many people are dying,
my God.

978
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'd better eat fast
tonight.

979
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].

980
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh it's cold. 
Every Thanksgiving

981
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I bring meals from
God's Love We Deliver

982
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-to people who absolutely 
too ill to go out.

983
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This year I asked my 
grandson Cooper to come

984
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-with me. 
If can stop at an

985
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-electronic store, his
PSP is broken.

986
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you're very good I'll
buy a new one for your birthday.

987
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well my friend had 3 of them
and he gave me one.

988
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's very nice.
Well --

989
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is this the one he gave
you? Yes.

990
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does he have a single
grandfather?

991
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs].

992
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Flip your hands.
You have great hands Cooper..

993
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?
[laughs]

994
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At God's Love we deliver.
When I started out and I'm

995
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
on the board, we would give
AIDS patients that were going

996
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
we would give them food.
And now AIDS is chronic

997
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and I'm still delivering the fucking
food, I'm so pissed.

998
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know what it's like?
Thanksgiving morning, ding dong

999
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the guys opens the door,
you again?

1000
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[laughs}

1001
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the 3rd fucking
Thanksgiving in a row,

1002
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-buddy. 
Mr. ______ leave it over there.

1003
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm on my way to the gym.
The gym?

1004
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're going to die today
AIDS or me,

1005
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not sure which.
[laughs].

1006
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh look, she's got our
awww. How nice --

1007
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi. I'm Joan Rivers. 
My I come in?

1008
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm Joan Rivers, this is my
grandson Cooper.

1009
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh wow. Nice to see you.
Joan Rivers, the Joan Rivers

1010
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I pay the bills. 
You have entertained

1011
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-me for years, Miss Rivers.
I'm so glad.

1012
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a photographer.
And you can see there is

1013
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
on here. That's wonderful.
Right there, I photographed

1014
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-the same drugstore for 
20 years.

1015
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Every time they change the
price of cigarettes.

1016
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
{laughs].
How brilliant is that?

1017
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where was it shown, Life
Magazine. I have taken over

1018
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-a 1000 photos so, you
might even know my work.

1019
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look up flowbox.com.
Thank you, thank you.

1020
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't wait to get out of
here and get home and

1021
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-look you up.
flow box baby.

1022
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The name is Flo Box.
What happened that caused

1023
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-your eye sight to fail?
I believe it's connected
