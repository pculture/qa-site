      <p begin="00:03:04.675" end="00:03:10.478">They don't usually ask about me,<br/>Gotham, they ask about him, Deepak.</p>

      <p begin="00:03:35.498" end="00:03:39.933">The only way to catch my dad is<br/>to catch up with him.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.933" end="00:03:43.525">He is being ordained as a Buddhist Monk.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:43.525" end="00:03:46.124">The plan is rendezvous with my dad<br/>in Bangkok.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.124" end="00:03:50.876">And faithfully document the latest chapter<br/>of the Chopra saga, it's a sure fire hit.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.876" end="00:03:54.732">Logline, a guru in his twilight years<br/>embarks on a year long journey</p>

      <p begin="00:04:04.415" end="00:04:09.617">Then the audio book, podcast,<br/>of course, my dad doesn't know it yet,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.617" end="00:04:12.842">but that's not the film<br/>I'm planning on making.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.992" end="00:04:20.183">I've always known that<br/>the world's perception of my father</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.183" end="00:04:23.906">doesn't necessarily align with mine.<br/>Is that really a surprise?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.906" end="00:04:27.960">Does anyone see their dad as some sort<br/>of spiritual holy man?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.960" end="00:04:32.540">Thirty-six years in, I still<br/>can't really tell you who my father is.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.109" end="00:04:37.056">Does that say something about him or me?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.056" end="00:04:40.976">I guess the film is the thing<br/>where I figure it all out.</p>

      <p begin="00:05:19.081" end="00:05:22.633">These are questions that have been<br/>asked for centuries and I think,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.633" end="00:05:26.965">it's in a sense, almost arrogant of me</p>
      <p begin="00:05:26.965" end="00:05:30.961">to suggest that I can answer<br/>these questions,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:30.961" end="00:05:37.574">that I can transcend to a higher truth<br/>where I can understand my own identity.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:40.033" end="00:05:44.025">- My father has been on the road non-stop<br/>for most of my life.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.025" end="00:05:47.979">So it's fitting we begin the story<br/>as tourists in a strange world.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.979" end="00:05:51.014">When your dad informs you of his plans<br/>to become a monk,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.014" end="00:05:53.492">don't try to make sense of it,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:53.492" end="00:05:55.490">you just roll the cameras<br/>and try to keep up.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.750" end="00:05:59.212">- Okay, you can't just keep<br/>filming randomly.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.212" end="00:06:05.370">Dad's a monk but he apparently paid<br/>for the souvenir shopping, photo ops,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.370" end="00:06:11.104">five star hotels and all paid for<br/>by wealthy Thai benefactor.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.104" end="00:06:17.098">What do you think about spiritual silence<br/>that starts at the Peninsula Hotel?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17.098" end="00:06:20.711">-I think it's a good prelude<br/>to be comfortable</p>

      <p begin="00:06:34.221" end="00:06:36.955">For about twenty years,<br/>I've had the romantic notion</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.955" end="00:06:40.905">of being ordained as a Buddhist Monk.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.981" end="00:06:47.333">And I've been ready to embark<br/>on a different plain of existence.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48.747" end="00:06:51.479">- Do you miss the family?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.402" end="00:06:55.742">No. It's too early actually.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.742" end="00:06:58.469">It's part of a much bigger story, Gotham.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.469" end="00:07:01.005">You have to leave your family,<br/>you have to leave your body,</p>

      <p begin="00:07:12.323" end="00:07:16.356">- Detachment from family<br/>has been a lifelong specialty of my Dad's.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.356" end="00:07:20.097">And following him down this river<br/>feels just like growing up with him,</p>

      <p begin="00:07:34.388" end="00:07:37.989">It also meant being raised<br/>in front of cameras.</p>
