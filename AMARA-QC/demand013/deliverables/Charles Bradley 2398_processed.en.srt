00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,661
who had a wife that she was very crazy about.

328
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,771
Otherwise, she probably never would have gone to New York.

329
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:14,409
[Charles] Oh, I was about the age of seven to eight years old when I was <u>.</u>

330
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,101
Our mother, when she came out, she-she told my grandmother,

331
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,065
"I want him to to come back and live with me."

332
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:22,060
My grandmother said, "No, let them stay here 'cause they are better off.

333
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:25,091
They'll get a better education if they stay down here with me."

334
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:27,013
So my mother says, "No."

335
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:29,341
So my grandmother said, "No, you're not taking them."

336
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:31,115
So, my mother stole us.

337
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:33,141
- They were mine.

338
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,824
So I figured, I got 'em. I mean, I created 'em.

339
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:40,564
So, then I'm gonna bring all my creations back to New York with me.

340
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:41,666
Mm-hm.

341
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,735
That's what I did.

342
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:50,473
- I really hate to say this, but I think, at that time it was hard to find jobs,

343
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:55,829
so there was only one way is you have some kind of dependents

344
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:59,480
that you can get some welfare.

345
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:02,949
And I feel like that's what she was doing

346
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,985
to get the welfare by having those kid there.

347
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:10,640
- During his infancy, now he was the, the favorite child.

348
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:15,566
He received all the, the-the loving and caring from his older brothers and sisters

349
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:18,257
and his grandmother and his uncles and all of us,

350
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:20,269
because he was the baby.

351
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:24,774
- Uh, when Charles went to New York, I think that's when he lost all of that.

352
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:31,815
- I was living with my Mom,

353
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:35,195
and I was afraid that she was gonna hurt me, so I left.

354
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:37,338
We couldn't see eye to eye.

355
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:38,877
See, I was getting blamed for everything.

356
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:40,386
So I was very bitter.

357
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:44,306
And it seemed like everything was rationed to us,

358
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:47,122
and I was in a basement worser than this one.

359
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:51,033
You know, it was just sand basement, it was no concrete basement.

360
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,953
Fifteen watt bulb light.

361
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,846
And I said "No, I can't take this."

362
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,614
I said, "I don't want it, I'm going."

363
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:57,868
So I left.

364
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:03,755
[Sound of a subway train passing]

365
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:05,908
I was fourteen years old.

366
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:08,742
My home was the subway train.

367
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,421
That's where I'd go to keep warm.

368
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:16,708
I'd get on the subway train some nights, or winter nights, cold.

369
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:19,169
Riding the A train back up and down.

370
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,507
The police, pop, pop, pop, hit the darn thing real hard

371
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:23,222
and say, "Kids, you need to get off."

372
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,099
I'd go across the, the platform, getanother train going back. I sleep.

373
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,108
Get me a little corner and get astick and knock the thing real hard.

374
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:35,369
It penetrate through my head.

375
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:38,730
He said, "Kids, get up. Kids, get up."

376
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:46,182
So, I just keep going different routes toget a night's sleep before daylight come.

377
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,264
And I see for myself, what's going down, because everybody back in those days

378
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:55,620
was getting high, using the hard drugs.

379
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,566
I'd watch them holding upwhile they're shooting up

380
00:19:58,566 --> 00:19:59,981
and they try to give it to me,

381
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,340
I got scared and I was afraid of needles.

382
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,815
I said, "No, no, no, no."

383
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,814
So that's when I headed to Jobs Corps.

384
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:09,304
And I tried to get my mother to sign me to go to Job Corps.

385
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:11,641
And she was mad with me, she wouldn't sign.

386
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:13,872
So I got my sister to forge her name.

387
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,814
And, um, I learned to cook.

388
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,869
I cooked for two years.

389
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:20,739
I was a cook trainee up in Bar Harbor, Maine.

390
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:23,420
And that's when I really started doing James Brown on the Job Corps.

391
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:26,562
But they said, "Man, you see that new guy that came in?

392
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,924
He looks just like that guy they call, James Brown."

393
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:35,603
And they got me fired up one day, they gave me some gin.

394
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:37,796
In the Job Corp, you were sneaky, you were supposed to sneak it in there.

395
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:40,932
They gave me some gin, got me really high,

396
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:43,260
and they gave me the microphone and they say, "Sing."

397
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:44,575
And I went crazy.

398
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:47,981
So then they told me to go -- they took me to a girls' Job Corps

399
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,106
center to perform.

400
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:51,856
I said, "How many peoples it's gonna be?"

401
00:20:51,963 --> 00:20:53,423
They said twenty or thirty peoples.

402
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:54,968
I said, "Okay."

403
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,836
And they called me on stage.

404
00:20:58,143 --> 00:20:59,906
And I look out that stage.

405
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:02,116
And I saw all those peoples, and I froze.

406
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:02,856
I said,

407
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:06,856
"Uh-uh, I ain't going out there. Not me, not me"

408
00:21:06,856 --> 00:21:11,931
So, this guy named Moody came behind me and gave me a push.

409
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:13,485
I see all the peoples was happy.

410
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:14,662
They love me.

411
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:16,620
They love me giving them my heart.

412
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,808
And I said, "Wow, this where I want to be at."

413
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,559
And I never stopped.

414
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:28,613
Our plans was when we got out of Job Corps

415
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:30,662
we was gonna get together and continue the music.

416
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:33,909
My band got drafted into the Vietnam War.

417
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:39,781
And, um, they went on to war and I went,completed my training at Job Corps.

- I wanna taste it when you open, uh, the beer that is a pumpkin.

421
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:56,778
- [Tommy] Oh, yeah.

422
00:21:56,778 --> 00:21:57,977
- I gotta taste that.

423
00:21:57,977 --> 00:21:59,500
- We can open it now.

424
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,232
- A pumpkin beer. I never heard of pumpkin beer.

425

-Working with Charles Bradley, as opposed to working with

441
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:29,731
Sharon or Lee or somebody,

442
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:32,884
the other singers from New Yorkthat I've so often worked with,

443
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,785
you know, Charles has got the craziest stories.

444
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,624
Craziest stories.

445
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:41,604
So, you know as a songwriter, I just sit around with him,

446
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:44,372
and, and I hear Charles tell these stories and you're just like,

447
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:47,427
you know, we gotta write a song about that, man.

448
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:50,022
So usually before we do the vocals on the track,

449
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:53,774
[Tommy] I'll play Charles' song and just ask him if he likes it, first of all.

450
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:57,171
Then, I'll sing him my ideas, you know, to tell him how I think it should go.

451
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,984
And not that he disregards my ideas,but he's just got his own ideas

452
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:04,021
and he just instantly starts expressing them.

453
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,664
He'll just start singing, and then we'll kind of stop

454
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:08,789
and just get away from it for a second and just talk.

455
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:09,897
And you just start--

456
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:13,940
you talk with Charles long enough and a story comes out about something.

457
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,192
[Tommy]That without me asking him, he'll start singing about what we just-

458
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:19,148
what we just spoke about.

459
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,728
And then I'll grab a pencil and paper,and let him kind of freestyle

460
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:24,481
over the track, over and over again.

461
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:27,660
And then we'll go back and that will become a song slowly, you know,

462
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,297
over the course of a couple of hours.

463
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:32,915
But, um, it's his stories that I'm always trying to translate into song, you know.

-[Charles] I went to California in 1977, searching for my dreams, music.

466
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,897
I was bouncing into different bands,

467
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:50,763
like they'll say, "Man, we'll pay you $400to do this tonight, the show tonight.

468
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,934
And this guy paid this, paid me to do this tonight.

469
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:55,711
That's how I was doing out there.

470
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,454
And at that time, I don't know why, I got sick.

471
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:05,166
I called my Mom, and she says,"Son, come on back home."

472
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,200
Mom is getting old and then, she been through a lot.

473
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:15,229
And I, it's not for me to crucify her for what she did in her life.

474
00:24:16,228 --> 00:24:20,245
So I came back to New York in '94.

475
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:24,682
I was sick as a dog, I was close to death.

476
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,773
They took me to Woodhull Hospital.

477
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:31,954
[Charles] I'm allergic to penicillin and they was feeding me penicillin.

478
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,758
And my body had shut down.

479
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,623
I had gave up totally.

480
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:48,072

I didn't wanna go in because I wasn't able to go through all that snow.

don't bother coming in no more."

I got my apartment, got bills, gotta pay rent.

Picked me up, got in the car.

After he drove about a mile or two miles and there was a StateTrooper

767
00:37:26,993 --> 00:37:29,633
on the side behind him. And put the siren on and pulled him aside.

Well, who's the guy next to you?

770
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:39,148
I said, "Now that's not my information to give you,

771
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:40,314
you have to get that information from him."

772
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:43,514
And so he grabbed me, called me a, "Wise Nigger."

773
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:45,440
And he grabbed me and throwed me against the car,

774
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,023
put the handcuffs on me.

775
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:49,201
He said, "I'd take you to the woods and bust your brains out.

776
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:51,486
When I ask you a question, don't act wise with me."

777
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:55,210
And I stayed there and then his partner came over and said, "Hey man."

778
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,660
Took him to the side, said something to him.

779
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:01,095
And then his partner, he kind of apologized to me.

780
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:04,372
Took the handcuffs off me and told me get in the car and go ahead.

781
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,545

and live only to be suffering.

789
00:38:26,766 --> 00:38:31,446

That's why I don't like tocome on this block no more.

859
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:19,140
- He came downstairs and, uh, he saw me crying.

860
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,394
He said, "Mom what's wrong?"

861
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:22,287
I said, "Just go next door."

"Charles, your brother is dead."

863

He said, "No, Mama, can't be."

00:43:28,678 --> 00:43:30,120
I said, "Yes, he is."

865
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,543
So there was probably a whole block was

866
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:35,631
filled with policemans with rifles and guns.

867

869
00:43:40,395 --> 00:43:44,409

870
00:43:44,532 --> 00:43:49,761
'Cause I saw this thing says Morgue,and when it says Morgue, what I did,

and the detective wouldn't let me in there.

00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:58,368
I told him that's my brother and you cannot stop me.

00:43:58,537 --> 00:43:59,937
So I pushed my way in.

Sometimes I do ask God just call me home.

963
00:49:40,138 --> 00:49:44,715
Because everyday I get out and Ifight and fight to keep the honesty,

964
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:48,319
the decency of a human being walking the planet and loving

965
00:49:48,442 --> 00:49:52,139
everybody as God asks you to love everybody.

966

967
00:49:56,923 --> 00:50:02,073
How much more can one give before they find love on the planet?

968
00:50:02,196 --> 00:50:04,273
How much more can you give?

969
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:09,178
I say, "Father, whatever the time or the hour you want me,

970

I'm ready to go."

I wasn't looking to buy a bird,'cause when I was a kid

00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:21,241
I had me a pet chicken and that was my pet.

1019
00:53:21,471 --> 00:53:25,009
And I raised it from a little billy, from a little biddy it was yellow

1020
00:53:25,271 --> 00:53:27,425
and he turned to be a beautiful hen.

1021
00:53:27,564 --> 00:53:30,195
And he used to sleep with me and he was a beautiful hen.

1022
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:35,676
Then one day, I had him about at least two years.

And I look in the oven, that was my chicken.

And I took that chicken out.

1034
00:54:06,858 --> 00:54:10,502
I dug a hole and buried him in the hole and put a cross on it.
