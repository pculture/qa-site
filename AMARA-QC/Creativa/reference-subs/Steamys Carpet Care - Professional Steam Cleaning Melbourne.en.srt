[Isabel:] My name is Isabeland I live in Caulfield.

4
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:52,520
Comparing Steamy's to others, I've had a wonderful experience.

5
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,417
They left the carpet virtually walkable on it straightaway.

6
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:59,679
It wasn't, it didn't feel wet.There was no smell afterwards.

7
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:05,747
They used these little utensils to putunderneath my furniture to help the carpet dry.

8
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:09,184
So, once it's dry, it doesn't leave stainswhen the furniture goes back on.

9
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,690
So, now my carpets look fantastic.

10
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,186
All the stains are gone, the shine of theoriginal carpet has actually come through.

11
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,443
I will definitely call them again.

12
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:21,392
In fact, I've already given their number out to several of my friends.

13
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:24,753
