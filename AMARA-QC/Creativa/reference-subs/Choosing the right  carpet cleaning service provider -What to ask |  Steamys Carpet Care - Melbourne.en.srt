[Comparing different carpet cleaners]

3
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:12,738
It is important to choose the right carpet cleaning business

4
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:16,215
because it is the difference between destroying your carpet

5
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:19,896
or making your carpet look nice and clean.

6
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:22,464
The first question you should ask is

7
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:24,554
who is actually going to do the job.

8
00:00:24,554 --> 00:00:28,214
Is the person a trainee, a student?

9
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:31,221
Or is he actually a certified technician?

10
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:35,299
A certified technician would have to pass training

11
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:40,139
and collect yearly points with IICRC.

12
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:46,742
That's an international organization that provides training worldwide.

13
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:51,819
The technician should show you a card like that,

14
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:55,409
showing what sort of training he did.

15
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,749
You should be asking the technician that comes to your house

16
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:03,823
what sort of method he is going to use to clean the carpets.

17
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:06,149
Well, there is the dry cleaning method.

18
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,164
There is the steam cleaning method.

19
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:13,245
Dry cleaning is actually a method that was created to compensate

20
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:17,781
on steam-cleaning in commercial properties.

21
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:22,081
When properties would get steam cleaned on a yearly basis,

22
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:25,864
the properties would still get dirty during that year.

23
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:28,864
So they brought the dry cleaning as a system

24
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:35,661
to maintain that carpet to look good between the two steam cleaning methods.

25
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:38,500
Did they move furniture when they cleaned the carpet

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,102
or they didn't move the furniture or just go around the furniture when they do the job?

27
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:47,540
One of the questions you should ask a carpet cleaning company

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,459
is how many jobs do they do a day.

29
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:56,024
If a company would say to you that they do any more than 4 jobs a day,

30
00:01:56,024 --> 00:02:00,302
that means they're not going to take the time in cleaning your carpets.

31
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:05,541
They'll be rushing in and rushing out as quick as they can to get to the next job.

32
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:09,630
For a 3-bedroom house with a hallway and a living area,

33
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,239
it should take roughly about 4 hours to do.

34
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,070
It's highly recommended when you ask your carpet cleaning company

35
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,813
what sort of method they use and what sort of process they use

36
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:24,700
like vacuum the carpet with hospital-grade vacuum cleaners,

37
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,379
agitate the carpet, steam clean the carpet with a truck-mounted machine,

38
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,234
and dry the carpet with drying pads.

39
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:38,582
The final touch would have to be grooming the carpet.

40
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:42,151
When you groom the carpet, you're getting rid of all the marks

41
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:46,647
that the drying, agitation, and the steam cleaning would leave on the carpet

42
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:50,262
to make the carpet look like brand new again.

43
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:52,580
You should ask the company you're choosing

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,510
if they do provide a written 100% money-back guarantee

45
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,540
if you're not satisfied with the job.

46
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,229
A good guarantee from a carpet cleaning company

47
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:06,943
would be if you're not happy with the job

48
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:11,358
they'll come back and do the job again free of charge.

49
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,442
If you're still unhappy with the job,

50
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:18,500
you make this company pay for a different carpet cleaning company

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,703
to come back and clean your carpet.

52
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:25,547
Finally, remember, it's not just about the cost.

53
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:30,590
It's about taking care of your precious and expensive carpet.
