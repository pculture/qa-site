Hello. Oh hey, David. How are you?

- [Philip Nobel] Larry Silverstein
was vilified immediately

65
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,840
as the greedy developer,
because people in New York

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,231
don't know any other kind of developer.

67
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,150
- [Silverstein] It wouldn't surprise me,

68
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,881
if the replacement of the
Twin 110-storey towers

69
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:11,360
ultimately results in the
creation of four towers.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,314
Perhaps, 50, 55--
maybe 60 storeys in height.

71
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:19,285
- [Philip] The first thing he did was
he came out with a plan for the site.

72
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:25,479
A kind of a sketch plan for the site
that rebuilt all of the square footage

73
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,774
to the inch and then
threw in a little park.

74
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:31,184
And that was a week after the attack.
You know, too early.

75
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,798
Then, he told the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

76
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:38,265
that it would be a tragedy
for him not to rebuild.

it was awful. It was awful.

policemen trying to find--

81

I mean, it was excruciating.

82

- [Philip] One of the things people forget
about the event and the re-development

83
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:24,850
is this little special period of time,
between the Tuesday of the attack

standing on this pile of God knows what,

in addition to all the other things

101

very difficult to do anything,

<i>No commercial office building </i>
that I know of,

106
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:53,477
<i>in the history of offices </i>

107
00:07:53,828 --> 00:08:02,586
to also be a symbol of defiant renewal
or a symbol of vengeance,

108
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:07,112
or a symbol of healing, you know.
That's just not what skyscrapers do.

109

right behind us, right here, 
as a site for economic development.

a soaring monumental, beautiful memorial.

This could be a place

a hundred and a thousand 
years from now.

116

<i>We have to be able to create something</i>

[crowd applauding]

119
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,658
<i>- [Raab] When Mayor Guiliani gave </i>
his farewell address, he suggested

120
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:03,961
<i>that nothing should be rebuilt here,</i>
that it'd simply become a memorial.

121

<i>A large, serene memorial </i>
to the people who died on 9/11.

122
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,397
There was never any chance of that
happening. I think the Mayor knew it.

123
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:18,274
I think the proof that he knew it 
was to create the LMDC,

00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:22,104
the Lower Manhattan Development
Corporation, in order to pass that

125
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:26,305
along to George Pataki, for fear that
a mayor, who was not a Republican,

00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:28,476
was going to succeed Guiliani.

ALBANY

128
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,782

right after September 11th.

129
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:41,162
Mayor Guiliani and I sat down and said,
"We're gonna need massive assistance.

We're gonna have help from Washington.
We're gonna have insurance proceeds.

- [Reporter] The Governor of New York
is central to what eventually happens

134
00:09:56,727 --> 00:10:00,361
in Lower Manhattan. Here's why.
Two agencies, the Lower Manhattan

135
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:03,188
Development Corporation and 
the Port Authority control the process

136
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:06,392
and New York's Governor 
controls half of each.

137
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,602
- [Philip] There's no single person 
involved with the re-development

138
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:13,590
who had his much sway 
on it as George Pataki.

139
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:18,443
<i>He achieved that position </i>
by creating the LMDC

140
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:25,821
and initially packing it with his cronies
and using it as almost like, control rods

141
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:29,788

At some point, he would slow it down,

142
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,740
at some point, he would speed it up,

143
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,722
purely to suit his needs

several insurance companies claiming,

150
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,731
<i>the attack on Twin Towers</i>
was two separate events.

151
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,902
<i>The insurers say it was one.</i>

152
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,346
<i>Billions of dollars are at stake</i>
on the outcome.

153
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:10,610
- [Silverstein] First issue. One event,
two events. We needed, as it turns out,

154
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,318
we needed two events, 
because to rebuild the Trade Center,

155
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:15,318
the cost to rebuild the Trade Center

156
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:21,098
would require, not just $3.5 billion,
it would require closer to $7 billion.

157
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,810
Right? We needed more money.

158
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,400
<i>- [Roland Betts] I think</i>
he was preoccupied with this

159
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,521
<i>bizarre legal theory</i>
that there were two buildings,

160
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,408
<i>so therefore it was two separate incidents</i>
and therefore,he had to double his return.

161
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:37,536
Most of us in the LMDC thought just
logically, that would be a silly result.

162
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:40,640
You know, you have insurance policy
on two buildings for a set number.

163
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:44,712
I don't see mathematically, how you're
gonna end up with more than a set number.

164
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:48,948
<i>- [Janno Lieber] People argued about it</i>
a little bit, like it was common sense,

165
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,585
<i>but believe me, anyone who has read</i>
an insurance policy knows

166
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,343
<i>it's not a common sense industry,</i>
it's all about the specific language

167
00:11:55,343 --> 00:12:01,435
and what it means. And in fairness, that 
was essential to protect the possibility

168
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:03,343
of rebuilding, that somebody talked about,

169
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,344
"How are we gonna get 
the money to do this?"

170
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:11,710
The result was that Larry was a typecast,
I think, early on in the process,

171
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,303
as somebody who was fighting about money,
while people were worrying about

172
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:20,710
human loss and then about whether we
were gonna build something great.

173
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,379
And Larry was off fighting about money.

174
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,653
- [Silverstein] They did everything 
they possibly could to excoriate,

175
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:36,349
to criticize, to denigrate. 
It was just a constant flow.

176
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:40,249
Talk about, needing a thick skin 
for that, let me tell you,

177
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:43,136
I just had to get thick fast.

178
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:51,210
<i>Born in Brooklyn, it was not</i>
a very pretty part of Brooklyn.

179
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,968
<i>So, probably not one of the best,</i>
probably one of the worst.

180
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,212
I remember we lived at the top of a--
either a six or a seven story walk-up.

181
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:03,490
It had the best view, 
but you had to walk up.

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,857
It was not a very luxurious existence.

183
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:11,744
My parents, obviously, were struggling.
And then after that, I went to NYU.

184
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:16,602
And by this time, my father gravitated
into the real estate business.

185
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:19,470
He became a real estate broker. 
He read someplace that real estate

186
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,511
was a foundation of wealth,
so he decided to become a broker.

187
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,258
I said, "The guys who make the money
are the guys who own the buildings."

188
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:27,160
I said, "We could become an owner."

189
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,826
<i>I remember finding a building</i>
down on East 23rd street,

190
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:34,370
so I remember finding how much it was.

191
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,370
Six-hundred thousand
it was for the building.

192
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:41,283
Six-hundred thousand, where do you get $600,000?

193
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,322
<i>So what we did, we went to the people</i>
my father had successfully leased

194
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:52,297
stores and lofts to. And then,
I had made the pitch.

195
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:57,760
They only joined us for a 
small investment in the building.

196
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:01,585
And one after one another,
finally said, "yes."

197
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:05,673
<i>And we bought buildings, bought larger buildings and we renovated buildings,</i>

198
00:14:05,673 --> 00:14:09,820
<i>we altered them, we modernized them.</i>
And then, ultimately, it led to finally

199
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,545
being the foundation. Pour in the slab
and building the building.

200
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:19,155
<i>- [Lieber] 7 World Trade Center</i>
was developed in the early 1980s,

201
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:21,410
<i>because the Port Authority</i>
had a piece of land,

202
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,596
<i>just north of the World Trade Center site</i>
and they decided to develop it.

203
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:26,697
And Silverstein won the bid.

204
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:29,580
And so, all of a sudden, 
Silverstein was at a new level.

205
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:33,668
<i>- [Silverstein] I remember</i>
at the topping out ceremony of 7,

206
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,887
looking up at the Twin Towers,
and saying to myself,

207
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,451
"God, look at this."

208
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:41,530
But my building's big.
 It's a 2 million foot building.

209
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,995
It's a big building. 
But, look at that stuff, huge.

210
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,724
<i>And there are two of them, right? Massive. </i>

211
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,138
<i>I said, "Wouldn't it be fantastic</i>
if someday I'll own those?"

212
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:03,314
Got it done. Hence, therein started 
the odyssey, six weeks before 9/11.

213
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,407
<i>- [speaker] I think the Tower</i>
should be built back.

214
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:15,800
<i>I think it should be built tall,</i>
as tall, if not taller.

215
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,236
I like to comment earlier about a
library. I always said I wanted a school.

216
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,280
- [speaker] You could also have
an exhibition hall.

217
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,317
You could have a concert hall.
There's enough room there.

218
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:30,948
- [speaker] How could you build
on sacred grounds?

219
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:34,129
The whole site should be a memorial.

220
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:41,442
- [speaker] Our new World Trade Center
Towers must be at least 111 storeys tall.

221
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:45,987
[crowd applause and cheers]

222
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:50,272
- [Lieber] People are starting to think
about what's going to be created there.

223
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:55,655
<i>And ultimately, there's a debate</i>
about what should happen

224
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,331
at the World Trade Center site, 
which is classic New York,

225
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:00,650
with everybody taking very strong opinions

226
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,891
that pull in totally opposite directions,

227
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:07,760
<i>where a lot of different people are</i>
fighting for the one thing that they want.

228
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:11,890
What ought to be rebuilt there?
How do we respond to 9/11?

229
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,648
- [Rosaleen Tallon] I should call Sally 
and tell them I'm two minutes away.

230
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:23,320
Excuse me. Sorry.

231
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:26,545
See, if you get behind 
these slow people, you know.

232
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,670
- <i>How are you doing, Rosaleen?</i>
- Good to see you. Hi, Dorman.

233
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:39,590
[people chattering]

234
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,885
Good morning. 
My name is Rosaleen Tallon.

235
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,462
This is my mother, Eileen.

236
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:52,525
We lost my brother, Sean Patrick Tallon.
He was a probationary firefighter

237
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:56,472
at Ladder 10, which is the firehouse
at the World Trade Center.

238
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:02,813
If you look at Oklahoma City,
those families are really an integral

239
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:06,470
part of the process to
decision-making process.

240
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,522
So, to say at a minimum,
 that's what we're asking.

241
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,362
Include us in the process.

242
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:13,572
Because to this point, 
we have not been included.

243
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,615
[dog barking in distant]

244
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:18,007
[kids playing in distant]

245
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:21,880
<i>We knew he was always going to be</i>
either a policeman or fireman.

246
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,944
<i>It was just, you know,</i>
as they say,"It's in the Irish."

247
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:29,602
The first tower collapsed. 
And then, we arrived home

248
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:35,283
and we watched the tower on TV
and we knew that Sean was up there

249
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:38,123
because his company 
would've been first on the scene.

250
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,812
So, there was no doubt in our minds
that he was in there.

251
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:53,959
<i>I remember standing at the precipice,</i>
right outside the firehouse door.

252
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:58,793
<i>These people are buried inside there.</i>

253
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:02,160
I mean, loved ones. I mean,
knowing Sean was in there,

254
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,258
I mean, my God, 
like looking at that pile,

255
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:07,607
and knowing that my little brother
was in there

256
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:09,800
and there wasn't anything 
I could do about it.

257
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:16,666
<i>Because of the enormity of what happened</i>
and all of these people died in there,

258
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:21,691
<i>my parents were definitely hoping</i>
that the site could, say,

259
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:24,450
<i>be a green field of remembrance.</i>

260
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,883
But we realized that wasn't going to be.

261
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:30,529
There were too many commercial
and real estate interests that

262
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:34,844
you know, they had to build back up
their square footage.

263
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:41,151
<i>- [Pataki] One of the things</i>
that people don't appreciate is that

264
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:45,313
<i>there was an enormous economic fallout</i>
after September 11th.

265
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:49,647
We lost a 100,000 private sector jobs
that morning.

266
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:53,245
<i>We lost millions of square feet</i>
of office space.

267
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:58,261
<i>Companies were leaving New York,</i>
so it had to get built.

268
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:02,180
<i>And the initial plan was,</i>
let the Port Authority do it.

269
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:07,512
THE PORT AUTHORITY

270
00:19:07,878 --> 00:19:10,812
- [Kenneth Ringler] I was having dinner
at a local pub around the corner

271
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:13,440
from my apartment and somebody was
sitting next to me and they said,

272
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,902
"So, what do you do?" and I said,
"Well, I run the Port Authority."

273
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,351
And they said, "Does that mean you
do the bus scheduling?"

274
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,439
And I had to explain that 
the Port Authority

275
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,944
was a little more
 than the bus terminal.

276
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:27,729
- [Lieber] Port Authority built 
the Lincoln Tunnel

277
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:31,800
and George Washington Bridge

278
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,749
and many of our biggest
transportation facilities

279
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:36,914
and also built the World Trade Center.

280
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:44,125
<i>- [Silverstein] I obligated myself to pay</i>
the ground rent of $120 million a year

281
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,795
<i>to the Port Authority for 99 years,</i>

282
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:51,745
which is like in perpetuity with 
no abatements of any kind

283
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:53,394
'cause no one anticipated the 9/11 event.

284
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:56,169
- [Kenneth] You know, it stuck in his
craw that he had to do that.

285
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:00,100
But, the fact of the matter is,
he was insured to do that.

286
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,658
It's called business 
interruption insurance.

287
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,230
And you continue paying your rent.

288
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,213
- [Raab] Here is Larry Silverstein paying,

289
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:09,294
I think, $10 million a month 
ground rent at nothing.

several hours after the Twin Towers fell.

294
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:25,523
<i>The owner of the 47-storey building</i>
hopes to break ground on a new structure

295
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:26,865
<i>on September 11th.</i>

296
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,110
<i>- [Silverstein] So, once we started</i>
designing the building,

297
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,312
<i>people came out of the woodwork and said,</i>

298
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:36,723
"Silverstein, you're crazy.
No one's gonna come back down.

299
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,812
I mean, this is foolhardy. Second of all, 
you got that burning mass

300
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:43,913
immediately to the South area,
it's ground zero. It's a mess.

301
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:49,473
I mean, how is anybody gonna 
come back around? It's foolishness.

302
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:53,240
I mean, you're really doing yourself
irreparable harm."

303
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:57,283
<i>- [Lieber] 7 World trade Center,</i>
we wereable to get the building going

304
00:20:57,283 --> 00:21:00,832
<i> very quickly, because it was</i>
just us and the Port Authority

305
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:03,940
and that was it. 
We didn't have to deal with

306
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,123
a ton of different government agencies.
Across the street was totally different.

307
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:13,636
<i>On the city side, we had the Mayor,</i>
the Economic Development Corporation,

308
00:21:13,636 --> 00:21:15,400
<i>the Industrial Development Agency,</i>

309
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,381
<i>the Department</i>
of Environmental Protection,

310
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:20,928
<i>the Department of Transportation,</i>
Department of Design and Construction,

311
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:23,152
<i>the Police Department,</i>
the Fire Department,

312
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:26,675
<i>the Buildings Department,</i>
the City Council and

313
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:28,574
<i>the Local Community Board.</i>

314
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:32,260
<i>On the State level, we had</i>
the Empire State Development Corporation,

315
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,101
<i>the Department</i>
of Environmental Conservation,

316
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:36,869
<i>the State Historic Preservation Office,</i>

317
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,243
<i>the New York State Department</i>
of Transportation,

318
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:42,150
<i>the New York State Office</i>
of Emergency Management,

319
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,680
<i>and then, even at the Federal level,</i>
we had Congress,

320
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,450
<i>we had the White House,</i>

321
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,838
<i>Department of Housing</i>
and Urban Development

322
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:51,284
<i>the Federal Department</i>
of Homeland Security,

323
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:55,390
<i>FEMA, SBA, EDA, OSHA,</i>

324
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,376
<i>and not to forget</i>
the Army Corps of Engineers,

325
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:02,102
<i>so it just went on and on and on.</i>

326
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:08,278
- [Betts] I started calling meetings
of the heads of all the agencies

327
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:14,370
and Silverstein's is on. And the meetings
had 50, 60 people in the room.

328
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:18,334
It was completely unworkable.
Tremendous cross currents.

329
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:25,937
Silverstein and the Port Authority
wanted a 10 million square feet of

330
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:30,187
<i>office space and at the other end,</i>
some victim families wanted this

331
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:31,917
<i>to be hollowed ground.</i>
They wanted nothing.

332
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,407
<i>There was another group</i>
that said that they wanted to see the

333
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:37,935
<i>Twin Towers rebuilt exactly</i>
as the Twin Towers.

334
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:41,297
From the beginning,
I was pretty pessimistic

335
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:44,214
that this could actually be coralled.

336
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,264
<i>- [Raab] Once the site was cleaned up,</i>
people expected something to arise

337
00:22:51,264 --> 00:22:53,804
<i>magically from the dust. Hey,</i>
it's New York City,

338
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,804
<i>let's get it done yesterday.</i>

339
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:58,607
But I don't think people 
get the complexity of the site

340
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:03,231
especially below grade and the fact
that it's literally a couple hundred feet

341
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:06,967
from a big river and that it ain't easy
to keep that river from pushing

342
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:10,202
through the earth on this site.
And in fact, that was one of the

343
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:14,110
most daunting, if not the most daunting
challenge of the original building,

344
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,659
the original Twin Towers was,
how do you keep the Hudson River out?

345
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,661
<i>- [Announcer] The site actually consisted</i>
of water log landfill,

346
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:28,475
<i>which had accumulated over two centuries</i>
out of old wharves and debris.

347
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:33,365
<i>To support the great weight of the towers,</i>
foundations had had to be dug

348
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:37,309
<i>down 70 feet to bedrock.</i>
An underground wall was built

349
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:41,895
<i>completely sealing the site.</i>
Excavation began.

350
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,468
- [Pataki] Given the ownership,
given the emotion,

351
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:48,447
given that the technical 
engineering challenges,

352
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:52,290
you couldn't have a more difficult site.
But everybody knew that.

353
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:55,230
And it's what you have.

354
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:09,126
- [Betts] What we decided to do was,
engage a firm called, Beyer Blinder Belle.

355
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:13,958
And so, Beyer Blinder Belle came in
and they became the architects of record.

356
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:19,311
- [Philip] They were hired by the LMDC
to just crunch the numbers

357
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:24,614
<i>and show what could happen spatially</i>
in that place, using these numbers

358
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:26,313
<i>dictated by Larry Silverstein's lease.</i>

359
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:29,173
<i>With this big pile of square footage</i>
and this kinda little area,

360
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:31,457
<i>what are we gonna doand what's possible?</i>

361
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:35,606
So, Beyer Blinder Belle was working 
on these designs and the public

362
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:41,178
desire for a meaningful, symbolic
architectural solution reserved

363
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:44,746
building through the months and they
happen to converge in public

364
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:49,429
in the Javits Center, in this 
very hi-tech, super managed,

365
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:51,742
so-called 21st century town meeting.

366
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:56,921
- [Reporter] Six proposals are on
the table. Today, 5000 New Yorkers

367
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:59,497
will have a chance to voice 
their opinions about those plans

368
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,111
at a meeting called, <i>Listening to the City.</i>

369
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:07,497
[people chattering]

370
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:10,330
- [speaker] The footprints is not to
sort of acknowledge some great

371
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,117
architecture, but the place is 
sort of charged with meaning

372
00:25:13,117 --> 00:25:19,251
and so many loved ones in layers,
that it is one way to have a somber,

373
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,970
yet, not offensive memorial.

374
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:31,296
- [speaker] I just wanna see as much left 
that was there before September 11th,

375
00:25:31,477 --> 00:25:36,513
still there after this 
scariest memory constructed.

376
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,597
<i>- [Betts] And everybody could participate.</i>

377
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:40,837
<i>They had little computer boards there.</i>
Everybody could vote for anything.

378
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:43,519
And everybody could talk and so on.

379
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,507
<i>- [speaker] Sometimes, when you look</i>
at all of this, you wonder,

380
00:25:45,507 --> 00:25:47,290
<i>"Where's the memorial?"</i>

381
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,397
Have we just moved on and 
created tax-free shopping days?

382
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:52,924
- [speaker] We don't like the fact
that green as an isolated rectangle

383
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:56,200
with buildings around it.
- Not enough green.

384
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,195
<i>- Go back to this drawing book.</i>
- Strongly, this is strongly helpful.

385
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:01,294
<i>- Get new architects.</i>

386
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,262
<i>- [Betts] And the comments in real time,</i>
would show up on a screen

387
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:07,731
<i>'cause the typing</i>
would show right up there.

388
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,242
<i>And then people would vote</i>
for what they like and didn't like.

389
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:14,609
And somewhere about two-thirds the way
through the meeting,

390
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,925
a comment showed up on the screen saying,

391
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:20,248
"I hate all these plans.
They look like Albany."

392
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:24,219
Okay, and I really think 
that captured the day

393
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:27,498
because I think everybody looked as if,
"Yeah, they kinda do."

394
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:32,472
- [Pataki] It was a perfectly good plan
for a site that didn't have

395
00:26:32,472 --> 00:26:36,386
the emotional and historic 
importance to America.

396
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:41,528
But from that sense, it was unacceptable.
So at that point, we said no.

397
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:46,900
- [Philip] After the Beyer Blinder Belle
plans were essentially shut down,

398
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:53,667
you know, publicly, at the Javits Center,
the Pataki messaging machine

399
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:57,358
was in a little bit of a crisis
because the election was approaching

400
00:26:57,358 --> 00:27:02,882
and the idea that he "wasn't doing
enough at Ground Zero fast enough."

401
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:04,577
had already been injected
into the campaign.

402
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:08,470
And then, there was a moment of the LMDC

403
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,645
sort of casting around, saying, 
"What now?"

404
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:15,440
- [Betts] I called an emergency meeting
of the LMDC and I said,

405
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,642
"Look, we gotta scrap this thing.
This is nowhere. These plans stink.

406
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:25,752
Everybody knows they stink.
And we gotta do something."

407
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:27,118
"Okay, well what do you wanna do?"

408
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:30,680
I said, "I wanna have an architectural
competition. A true competition."

409
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:33,220
- [Pataki] We are going to go out
and have a process

410
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,194
and engage some of the 
world's greatest architects.

411
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,550
<i>- [Philip] And the next step</i>
was to seek out the visionaries.

412
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:07,235
<i>- [Announcer] The LMDC is now looking</i>
for new international design teams

413
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:11,316
<i>to come up with still more concepts</i>
using broad guidelines that include,

414
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:14,870
<i>a tall symbol or structure</i>
seen in the skyline,

415
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,430
<i>the footprints of the original Twin Towers</i>
would remain undeveloped.

416
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:23,359
<i>- [Philip] By the following December,</i>
every network in the world,

417
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,829
<i>set up to film this dramatic unveiling</i>
of the new future of Ground Zero.

418
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,691
<i>- [Betts] We're about to see</i>
seven very different visions

419
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:36,506
by some extraordinary thinkers
in their approach to the restoration

420
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,234
of hope and optimism to Lower Manhattan.

421
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:42,109
- [Architect] We tried to make with
these united towers,

422
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:46,456
<i>what we call, "The City in the Sky,"</i>
which at the 60th floor.

423
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:48,848
<i>These towers come together and join.</i>

424
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:52,219
- [Architect] The two tall towers in
the middle are at least 1400 feet tall.

425
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:56,021
They symbolize triumph. 
They're sort of universal.

426
00:28:56,021 --> 00:28:58,370
They're standing there on big shoulders
with their hands in the air.

427
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,109
- [Architect] A natural fact. 
It's two towers, which kiss

428
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,665
and touch and become one.

429
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:07,522
<i>- [Daniel Libeskind] When I first started</i>
on the competition, everybody had an idea.

430
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:11,321
Every New Yorker, every member 
of the family, every uncle, aunt, niece,

431
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:16,150
nephew, every acquaintance. 
When they found out that I was doing it,

432
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:20,838
"I have an idea. Do this, do this."
And it suddenly occurred to me

433
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:24,446
that this was really not just 
an architectural issue,

434
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:27,460
it was an issue of the soul of people,

435
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,582
because everyone was somehow,
part of that day.

436
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:34,907
- [Betts] We had a broad spectrum,

437
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:38,300
but it was clear that there 
were two that emerged.

438
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:42,314
One was Daniel Libeskind 
and one was Rafael Viñoly.

439
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:48,926
- [Rafael Viñoly] We started 
this process, essentially by defining

440
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:54,312
for ourselves a principle, what we felt
was moral obligation,

441
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:58,760
which was not only to remember
the ones that perished in this tragedy,

442
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,931
but also, to use their memory 
to elevate our memory

443
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:06,633
to become the inspiration
for a better future.

444
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,706
- [Betts] The Viñoly plan was 
very, very different.

445
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:17,597
<i>The Viñoly plan had these round cylinders,</i>
if you will, that you could see through.

446
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:22,155
<i>The idea was that they were preserving</i>
as a hollowed ground

447
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:27,360
the space in which people died.
Well, this was spunky.

448
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:31,648
This was really different
and really interesting.

449
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:35,453
<i>- [Viñoly] The skyland of Manhattanis</i>
re-structured, re-constructed

450
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:40,300
with the icons of the public life.Thanks.

451
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:43,567
[crowd applause]

452
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:49,879
<i>- [Betts] I'm now happy</i>
to present Daniel Libeskind.

453
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:52,026
[applause]

454
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:55,000
- [Libeskind] Thanks.Thank you very much.

455
00:30:55,688 --> 00:31:00,213
<i>I arrived by ship to New York</i>
as a teenager, an immigrant.

456
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:05,748
and like millions of others before me,
my first sight was that of the

457
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:09,159
Statue of LIberty and the 
amazing skyline of Manhattan.

458
00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:14,245
I have never forgotten that sight
or what it actually stands for.

459
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:16,969
This is what this project is all about.

460
00:31:17,383 --> 00:31:19,995
- [Philip] Everyone had been looking
for a leader or you know,

461
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:23,480
someone to put a non-political,
non-bureaucratic face in the process

462
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,171
and all of a sudden, arrives this guy
with the perfect back story

463
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:30,855
and you know, the ability to present
it, you know, super effectively.

464
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:34,894
- [Libeskind] I grew up in Poland. 
Then to America, where my father had

465
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:39,016
his only surviving sisters who
were an Al Fritz, from a family

466
00:31:39,016 --> 00:31:43,548
of ten brothers and sisters, so he was 
determined to come to New York.

467
00:31:43,957 --> 00:31:47,253
<i>It represented everything that people</i>
dreamed about and it still does.

468
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:54,458
Those who are lost have become heroes.
To commemorate those lost lives,

469
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:00,993
I created two large public spaces.
The park of heroes and the wedge of light.

470
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:10,550
The sky will become home again to
a towering spire 1776 feet tall,

471
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:16,102
creating an icon that speaks to our
vitality in the face of danger

472
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,818
and our optimism in the 
aftermath of tragedy.

473
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:23,326
- [Philip] When asked to do this thing,
which is so impossible

474
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:27,993
that it's almost magic, you know, 
architects can fill in the difference

475
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:31,729
by attaching words to the project.
People understand words.

476
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:39,175
And Libeskind's architecture always 
comes heavily loaded with words.

477
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:43,743
<i>And the design he presented at Ground Zero</i>
with the matrix of heroes

478
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:47,838
<i>and the wedge of light and the tower</i>
that through a tight, somehow spoke

479
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:49,786
<i>about the Declaration of Independence.</i>

480
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:54,717
<i>All of that stuff bridges the gap between</i>
what can be, you know,

481
00:32:54,717 --> 00:32:58,789
<i>very funny looking architecture and things</i>
that real people can actually understand,

482
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:01,819
because "I'm gonna make you feel better
about September 11th,"

483
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:03,528
is not a thing
that a building can say.

484
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:07,383
- [Libeskind] It's 1776 feet high,
very important and it is not just about

485
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:10,213
nations, it's about ecological zones,
ecological regions.

486
00:33:10,213 --> 00:33:13,633
The twenty upper storeys will be 
developed into very spectacular--

487
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:15,804
it's like a park standing vertically
and of course--

488
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:19,880
<i>- [Philip] Daniel Libeskind read</i>
the political landscape perfectly

489
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,439
<i>and pitched to the city in the world</i>
and the powers that be, kind of merging

490
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:28,620
of you know, a hip architecture 
that was also flag-waving.

491
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,528
[crowd applause]

492
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:36,133
<i>- [Betts] I was so engaged in it.</i>
I thought it was phenomenal.

493
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:38,239
<i>But I didn't know</i>
what other people would think.

494
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:42,700
So, I went home that night 
and I started looking at newspapers

495
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,266
and I looked around tomorrow
morning's papers.

496
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:49,345
I looked, there's a site where you
can find every newspaper in the world.

497
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:54,849
<i>And I must've looked at 300 that night.</i>
I did it almost all night just looking.

498
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,115
<i>I just can't believe it. I tell my wife,</i>
"Look at this, God."

499
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:02,163
You know, in the middle of nowhere,
Malaysia... and here it is.

500
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:05,863
<i>One or more of those images</i>
was on the front page

501
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:08,867
<i>of every newspaper in the world.</i>

502
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:13,210
And I think that wasn't lost 
on Viñoly and Libeskind

503
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,414
and somebody was gonna win and therefore,
the stakes were unbelievably high

504
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:21,933
and they wanted to win. 
So, it did get a little naughty.

505
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:26,560
- [Philip] After Libeskind and THINK were
sort of selected as finalist,

506
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,680
there was, you know, 
campaigns of muttering.

507
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:37,467
- [Libeskind] You know, everybody wants
to win and you know, if you're naive,

508
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:40,148
you don't know what kind of forces
are arrayed against you.

509
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:44,353
There was not a minute
 that it was just, "Go, relax."

510
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:50,547
You know, meditate. It was a constant
passionate sort of struggle.

511
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:53,753
<i>- [Philip] And the kind of things,</i>
you know, that sort of rovey

512
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:57,218
<i>on political tactics,</i>
taken into the world of architecture

513
00:34:57,218 --> 00:35:01,812
and being propagated by amateurs.
So it was a good time for all.

514
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:06,646
- [Lieber] It was blood sport and these
 guys were going for the biggest prize

515
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:11,125
<i>the architecture had ever seen.</i>
And there's a lot at stake for that.

516
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,473
- [Philip] Libeskind had chosen to leave
the pit empty, preserved as a memorial,

517
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:21,785
<i>so his opponents started whispering</i>
that it was a pit of death

518
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:24,534
<i>and an open grave and kind of,</i>
you know, there's a lot of ways

519
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:27,548
<i>to see how that gesture</i>
could be perceived as inappropriate.

520
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:34,199
And then, the THINK team went 
you know, very high up in the air

521
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:38,182
with these open steel-- 
kind of Eiffel towers, so the Libeskinds

522
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:41,330
<i>started saying that they were</i>
skeletons in the sky.

523
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:55,182
- [Betts] So, we finally came to the
point of determining who we wanted to win

524
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:57,918
and we chose Viñoly's plan.

525
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:04,380
<i>- [Libeskind] It was early in the morning.</i>
I remember being in a car,

526
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,214
taxi in New York, going somewhere
Lower Manhattan and the headline,

527
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:10,856
the day before the competition
was to be judged in the <i>New York Times</i>

528
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:15,940
<i>was "Scheme selected, scheme ex-selected."</i>

529
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:17,676
<i>Was that my scheme?</i>

530
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,691
And of course, when I read that headline, 
I was crushed.

531
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:25,341
- [Pataki] I remember waking up
in the morning seeing the front page

532
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:29,913
of the <i>Times</i> that the LMDC is going
to choose the Viñoly plan and going,

533
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:35,450
"No, this can't be." 
Because I thought, the Viñoly plan,

534
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,520
one was, unbuildable, two was,
economically unsound and three,

535
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,879
<i>were the footprints where had these</i>
skeletons really rising into the sky

536
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:48,887
that to me symbolize 
the destruction of the past,

537
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:54,307
instead of the hope of the future.
And I just thought it was a terrible idea.

538
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:59,228
- [Betts] He just ripped Viñoly's plan.
And he said it looks like these oil tanks

539
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:03,784
<i>in New Jersey and no one's ever</i>
gonna want to walk in there,

540
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:07,140
<i>or they're gonna fall down,</i>
just all this stuff.

541
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:11,763
So now, we were in a pretty awful position
here because the LMDC had voted,

542
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:15,502
not just as a site committee,
but as the full LMDC

543
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:19,616
and expressed a clear preference
for Viñoly and basically,

544
00:37:19,616 --> 00:37:24,410
Pataki came in and kinda just pulled
the rug out from under the LMDC

545
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,523
and you know, he just 
reversed the decision.

546
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:29,250
- [Pataki] How are you? Good to see you.

547
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,729
- [Libeskind] Great day. 
This is a great day.

548
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:34,859
- [Betts] And so, in a sense,
the Libeskind plan became his plan.

549
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:39,989
- [Libeskind] It suddenly dawned on me
what immense responsibility I have.

550
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:46,366
It wasn't just all great. Oh my, God. 
Now, with these few lines on paper,

551
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:52,564
how am I going to be able to do
what I promised to do?

552
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:55,965
<i>- [Announcer] Out of this gaping wound</i>
in of the heart of

553
00:37:55,965 --> 00:37:59,885
<i>the New York Financial Center, where</i>
the 1300 foot tall Twin Towers once stood,

554
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:03,775
<i>an even taller building will rise.</i>

555
00:38:04,555 --> 00:38:08,533
- [Pataki] The design plan 
has an inspiring spire.

556
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,450
- [Libeskind] It is the biggest challenge.
The most profoundly moving

557
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,265
emotionally intellectual, 
architecturally spiritual project

558
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:15,700
I've ever done here, of course.

559
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,261
<i>- [Philip] For three months, Libeskind</i>
gave Pataki everything he needed.

560
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:21,636
[Libeskind laughs]

561
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:26,910
<i>He got in front of any camera</i>
and told a gripping story

562
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,455
<i>and there was imagery to attach to it.</i>

563
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:30,500
[bell ringing]

564
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,432
<i>And he was ringing</i>
the right political bells

565
00:38:32,432 --> 00:38:34,373
<i>and everyone was happy.</i>

566
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:36,611
Except for Larry Silverstein.

567
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:43,413
- [Lieber] Larry actually preferred 
Libeskind's entry to the others.

568
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:48,518
<i>But once it became clear that Libeskind</i>
wanted to design the building,

569
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:52,945
in addition to being the master planner,
we did get into a little conflict with him

570
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:57,362
<i>because Libeskind had done a couple</i>
of buildings of moderate size,

571
00:38:57,362 --> 00:39:02,621
<i>some architecturally dramatic ones,</i>
including the museum in Berlin.

572
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,453
But he had not done a skyscraper,
he had not done very tall tower,

573
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:08,750
which is a completely different exercise.

574
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:13,420
- [Betts] What Libeskind was picked for
was the master plan.

575
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,886
He was not picked to design and build 
skyscrapers, something he had never done.

576
00:39:19,764 --> 00:39:22,462
<i>- [Lieber] So, as Larry Silverstein</i>
explained to Libeskind once when

577
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:25,346
<i>we were having a meeting, he said,</i>
"Dan, if I'm gonna have open heart

578
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:29,114
<i>surgery, I wanna have somebody</i>
who's done it before.

579
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:35,163
And a building of 1700 feet in height,
is the architectural equivalent

580
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:36,785
of open heart surgery."

581
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:42,388
And Dan's wife, who is his partner,
you know, in his practice said,

582
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:45,360
"He's a quick learner," and Larry said,

583
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,559
"Not on my heart, you're not gonna learn
how to do open heart surgery."

584
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:50,757
- [Silverstein] This meeting's over.
We're done.

585
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:52,358
She says, "Don't get excited."

586
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:55,367
I said, "I'm not excited," I said,
"Just wanna say this meeting's over.

587
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,321
I'm having no further discussion
about the redesign.

588
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,400
It's off the table. Finished.

589
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:04,420
- [Libeskind] Here's a man with money,
with power, with the idea that

590
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,187
it belongs to him, he had his own ideas
with his own architects.

591
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,773
- [David Childs] Larry came to me 
and he said, "Your trade in life,

592
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:17,874
what you're a specialist is, 
is tall office buildings.

593
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,520
I need you to do this."

594
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:23,879
- [Lieber] Larry announced the truth,
which is he's gonna do the building

595
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:28,325
with the architect he chose,
which is David Childs,

596
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,988
from Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

597
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:32,719
<i>He did the Worldwide Plaza building,</i>

598
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,287
<i>he did the Bank</i>
of New York Operations Center,

599
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:37,287
<i>he's done a lot of big buildings.</i>

600
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,807
- [Libeskind] David is a, you know,
very accomplished, very powerful

601
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:43,663
architect running a firm 
of thousands of people.

602
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:48,832
You know, it was really kind of
<i>David and Goliath.</i> [laughs]

603
00:40:48,832 --> 00:40:55,370
- [Childs] It was a functioning, operating
office building in a capitalistic society.

604
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,682
This was not just a piece of 
sculpture there in the air.

605
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:03,938
<i>Some time in the middle of the summer,</i>
we were summoned to a meeting

606
00:41:03,938 --> 00:41:08,404
<i>at the offices of the LMDC</i>
and there was a negotiation.

607
00:41:08,404 --> 00:41:11,945
- [Philip] Libeskind and Childs were
literally thrown into a room together.

608
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:17,381
- [Childs] You've gotta have somebody
in charge. You can't have two generals.

609
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:21,399
You've gotta have one 
that has 51% of the vote.

610
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,266
And so, that's what I insisted on.

611
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:27,792
[people chattering]

612
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:29,911
- [Libeskind] This is not a press 
conference. This is a photo op.

613
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:32,511
<i>- [reporter] Have you ever seen</i>
happier faces in your life?

614
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:35,930
- [Silverstein] Once or twice.
- [Libeskind] It's a great day.

615
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:37,950
<i>Fantastic collaboration. </i>

616
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,619
Wait, we have to roll up our sleeves. 
We gotta get to work.

617
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,540
- [Childs] If body language says anything,
this is the picture.

618
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:46,201
<i>- [reporter] What's the reality?</i>

619
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:47,829
- [Libeskind] It's real, it's real.

620
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:49,324
[cameras clicking]

621
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:50,963
- [Silverstein] Okay, let's go.
Thank you.

622
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:54,146
Right behind you.
Keep going, keep going.

623
00:41:54,804 --> 00:42:00,830
- [Libeskind] David, they want us--- 
[Childs] This is our scheme,

624
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,547
see how well-- 
[Libeskind laughing]

625
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:05,127
<i>- [Lieber] But it was very clear</i>
from the beginning that these guys

626
00:42:05,127 --> 00:42:07,969
<i>did not look at things the same way.</i>

627
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:11,177
Childs and his team would present,
you know, technical issues

628
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:14,685
and how they propose to solve
them or options for solving them

629
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:19,923
and Libeskind's comments tended
to be focused on more ethereal,

630
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:26,420
symbolic and general issues, you know. 
I think Dan said,

631
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,847
"The top has to be more meaningful."
And that you could see

632
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:30,320
that Childs' blood rising.

633
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,765
- [Childs] I think that in fact, that
Libeskind thought that he would have

634
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:42,123
a more of a role than I was gonna be
somehow change and be willing to

635
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:49,523
just execute his role as a designer.
Frankly, Larry wouldn't permit that.

636
00:42:49,657 --> 00:42:53,248
- [Libeskind] He's an industrialist.
He wants to make profits.

637
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,412
He has an empire, you know.
It's not the philanthropic enterprise,

638
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:01,736
it's how to create profits,
which I appreciate.

639
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:05,815
Now, what would New York be 
if people were not entrepreneurial

640
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:12,888
to want make money. But that often came
into tension with other ideas.

641
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:20,978
- [Pataki] When our work is done,
the history of Lower Manhattan

642
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:23,524
would have been written, 
not by the terrorists

643
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:25,572
who attacked our city,

644
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:28,465
<i>but by the millions of New Yorkers,</i>
who stood up to defend it.

645
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:34,127
By the 5th anniversary of the attack,
September 11th 2006,

646
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:40,342
we will top off a new icon.
The 1776-foot tall Freedom Tower.

647
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:43,625
[applause]

648
00:43:44,162 --> 00:43:46,732
- [Raab] My vast--people 
close to the governor,

649
00:43:46,732 --> 00:43:50,349
was that political calculation
or a spur of the moment,

650
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:53,616
naming it, "The Freedom Tower."
And the best answer I've heard

651
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:58,144
is that it had been discussed,
but no one had really signed off on it

652
00:43:58,144 --> 00:44:00,988
and no one was sure of it until it came
out of his mouth during the speech.

653
00:44:00,988 --> 00:44:04,236
- [Pataki] What is 1776?
It's a symbol of our freedom.

654
00:44:04,236 --> 00:44:06,971
It's the year we proclaimed
our independence.

655
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:12,823
So it just made sense that word just
kinda fell in and fit the building.

656
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:16,343
<i>- [Philip] There's a letter in the </i>New York Post<i> that was brilliant.</i>

657
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:20,629
<i>The letter said, "This building is nothing</i>
but a perch for George Pataki

658
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:23,245
<i>to climb up and gaze off</i>
in the direction of Washington."

659
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:29,490
And that was true. Pataki was
actively using the process to further

660
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,155
his political ambition
as any politician would.

661
00:44:33,878 --> 00:44:36,471
- [Pataki] Good morning.
We're here today for the unveiling

662
00:44:36,471 --> 00:44:38,673
of the model of the Freedom Tower.

663
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:44,830
When Daniel Libeskind revealed
his master site plan, the idea was

664
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:48,491
to create a building, the tallest
building in the world, yes,

665
00:44:48,491 --> 00:44:55,997
but symbolically, 1776 feet tall.
But mostly today, is a celebration

666
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:59,874
of the successful collaboration
of two brilliant architects,

667
00:44:59,874 --> 00:45:02,743
who understand that 
this is not just a building,

668
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:04,579
this is a symbol of freedom.

669
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:09,453
So to Daniel Libeskind and to
David Childs, congratulations.

670
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:11,590
[cameras clicking]

671
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:16,543
[applause]

672
00:45:17,973 --> 00:45:19,707
- That's it?
- That's it.

673
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:24,562
Don't trip now as we go on there.

674
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:27,586
[people chattering]

675
00:45:27,586 --> 00:45:30,267
[cameras clicking]

676
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:34,816
[people chatting]

677
00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:38,272
<i>- [Philip] When Libeskind and Childs</i>
allegedly started working together,

678
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:43,400
<i>the kind of face saving design that came</i>
out of that, had this big stick on top.

679
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:49,587
And that stick and the numbers 
1776 were the only thing

680
00:45:49,587 --> 00:45:52,447
that survived of the original
Libeskind concept.

681
00:45:53,575 --> 00:45:56,255
<i>They presented this huge model</i>
that was 10 feet tall or something.

682
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:59,268
<i>It lit from within and who knows</i>
how much money was spent on it.

683
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,364
And as they were moving it 
out of the Federal Hall,

684
00:46:02,364 --> 00:46:06,150
where they had the presentation,
the S-1 guys broke the stick off,

685
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,635
so it could clear the door, you know.

686
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:11,140
And that was the last
we saw of Danny's stick.

687
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:20,120
<i>- [Rosaleen] No matter what people talk about,</i>
buildings or their real estate,

688
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,425
<i>Ground Zero is ground zero</i>
for what happened there.

689
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:25,959
So, the most important thing was
how we were gonna remember

690
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:27,977
what happened there to those people.

691
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:32,262
- [speaker] And this eternal flame
will be visible, just like the tower was,

692
00:46:32,262 --> 00:46:35,498
so you don't have to come to this
memorial to remember what happened here.

693
00:46:35,498 --> 00:46:37,766
- [speaker] The key feature of my design
is that every visitor

694
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:41,250
will clearly visualize and absorb
the enormity of the sacrifice.

695
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,589
Every victim will be represented

696
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:48,700
by his or her own individual
life-sized human statue.

697
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,320
- [speaker] We could then have
two or three foot crystal birds.

698
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,672
One for each life lost.

699
00:46:55,684 --> 00:46:58,970
[applause]

700
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:01,878
<i>- [Pataki] We wanted public involvement,</i>
so we invited submissions.

701
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:02,986
<i>We got thousands.</i>

702
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:07,068
- [Anchorman] More than 5000 people
submitted proposals for a memorial

703
00:47:07,068 --> 00:47:08,737
at the site of the World Trade Center.

704
00:47:08,737 --> 00:47:12,633
<i>Today, a committee chose this one.</i>
It's called, Reflecting Absence.

705
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:15,983
<i>Designed by New Yorker, Michael Arad,</i>
it will include the names

706
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:19,384
<i>of everyone killed in the 9/11 attacks</i>
on the World Trade Center.

707
00:47:27,248 --> 00:47:30,880
- [Michael Arad] I was working as
an assistant architect

708
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,333
for the New York City Housing
Authority, Design Department,

709
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:36,133
when I found out there was a competition
for the design of the memorial,

710
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:39,126
and I had to do this.

711
00:47:39,271 --> 00:47:44,692
There's no sort of rational explanation
for why you get so drawn into it.

712
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:52,580
<i>I came across this quarry in South Orange</i>
and there's just something very beautiful

713
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,470
<i>and evocative about it, because it had</i>
this sort of clearly traced out absence

714
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,971
<i>of all the rock</i>
that had been excavated out,

715
00:47:59,971 --> 00:48:04,906
but was softened by the water
and by the trees and I think that

716
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:09,359
helped me to start thinking about
the Memorial Plaza.

717
00:48:14,243 --> 00:48:18,791
<i>Days after the attack, I remember</i>
biking around Lower Manhattan

718
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,300
<i>at night and I made my way</i>
to Washington Square Park

719
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,114
<i>and I found myself standing</i>
near that central fountain,

720
00:48:25,114 --> 00:48:28,555
<i>the grand fountain.</i>
People placed candles there.

721
00:48:31,146 --> 00:48:33,219
<i>And I felt like I was part of that group.</i>

722
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,359
You know, I came there,
not knowing anybody

723
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,619
and not a word was said.
And I left a few minutes later

724
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,941
without having said anything
to anybody

725
00:48:40,941 --> 00:48:43,194
but, I left completely changed.

726
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:46,641
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
that notion of sort of being

727
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:48,641
<i>cruelly removed from the life of the city,</i>

728
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:53,860
<i>I mean, that just shattered. And we're part of it, a greater all.</i>

729
00:48:53,402 --> 00:48:54,681
<i>You had to be.</i>

730

[cycling sound]

731
00:49:04,122 --> 00:49:07,373
<i>- [Rosaleen] Our neighborhood here</i>
in Yonkers is full of police officers

732
00:49:07,373 --> 00:49:12,316
<i>and fire fighters. So, after 9/11,</i>
I met other family members

733
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:16,745
and they were very, very intent
on making sure that,

734
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,248
as they said, the brothers 
were listed with their ranks,

735
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,874
and I thought that was a no-brainer.

736
00:49:22,874 --> 00:49:26,914
So, they asked me, would I care
to join the group, advocating for 9/11

737
00:49:26,914 --> 00:49:31,727
issues, and they seemed like such
a simple thing to become involved in.

738
00:49:31,786 --> 00:49:36,525
- [Betts] I mean, simple things like,
what's the order of the names?

739
00:49:36,525 --> 00:49:40,727
<i>Is it organized alphabetically</i>
by last name?

740
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:45,346
<i>Is it organized alphabetically by last name</i>
within the firemen's group?

741
00:49:45,346 --> 00:49:47,655
Are the firemen over here 
and the police over here?

742
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:50,132
I mean, these are things 
that were debated for years.

743
00:49:51,063 --> 00:49:54,442
<i>- [Lieber] The Mayor started seeing</i>
the Memorial was not coming together

744
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:57,553
<i>as quickly or as well</i>
as everybody had hoped.

745
00:49:57,553 --> 00:50:00,197
And he took ownership of it.
He literally stepped up,

746
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:04,296
became the Chairman of the Board,
raised the money and started

747
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,274

schedules through.

it's his way or the highway.

<i>That's what I have felt.</i>

750
00:50:11,832 --> 00:50:16,146
He's a man that cast us aside
and made us seem like

751
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,961
we couldn't get over our grief.

CITY HALL

753
00:50:24,393 --> 00:50:26,724
- [Michael Bloomberg] People's views
change with time.

754
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:30,597
There's an emotion that, as soon as
you lose a loved one,

755
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:33,417
that it's very different than 
an emotion that you have

756
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:36,615
five and ten and twenty years later.

757
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:42,493
And we have to make sure we don't
respond to the first and in fact,

758
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:44,692
have a better perspective.
That's not to say,

759
00:50:44,692 --> 00:50:48,530
that you treat people cavalierly
or don't listen to them.

760
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,105
- [Rosaleen] The Mayor and the LMDC,
they were able to say,

761
00:50:53,105 --> 00:50:55,522
"Oh, look at these families."

762
00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:59,165
They're constantly complaining.
And then, when other issues came up,

763
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:03,896
"Oh, look, here comes the families again.
They're slowing the process down."

764
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:08,170
They actually blamed us 
for slowing Ground Zero down.

765
00:51:08,259 --> 00:51:11,379
- [Betts] And so, they actually stopped 
bugging the Mayor.

766
00:51:12,126 --> 00:51:15,520
But they went to Pataki and they found
a very receptive ear in Pataki.

767
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:19,452
- [Pataki] We always try to include
family members every step of the way,

768
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:24,730
as decisions were made and listen
to them and when you have,

769
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:26,601
obviously, thousands and thousands
of family members,

770
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:30,631
you're never going to have unanimity,
you're going to have divergent opinions.

772

of the Governors' race were winding down,

773
00:51:42,588 --> 00:51:45,603
the Republicans announced that
in 2004, they'd be hosting

774
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:48,326
the Republican Convention. 
You know, in Midtown, but within

Ground Zero to be a festering mess

777
00:51:57,153 --> 00:52:01,788
<i>of selfish infighting, as it had become.</i>
We need to show some progress.

778
00:52:02,678 --> 00:52:06,910
- [Pataki] On July 4th, as fireworks
burst in the sky,

779
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:10,670
ephemeral reminders of our liberty,
we will begin to reclaim

780

our skyline with a permanent
symbol of our freedom.

781

don't have cornerstones,

it wasn't a construction event.

the politicians would be in 
the big shot that would end up

base of the Freedom Tower design

Apparently, there were claims

that yes, the NYPD sent a letter,

<i>why are security concerned</i>
just now being presented?

849
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:25,721
- [Bloomberg] Well, they're not just
now being, you couldn't be more wrong.

850
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:29,901
The security concerns 
have been there since 1993.

851
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:32,781
1993, there was a bombing 
at the World Trade Center

852
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:34,994
and we did not learn our lesson.

853
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:37,917
<i>This is a building, particularly,</i>
Freedom Tower,

854

<i>that is built to be a symbol.</i>

855
00:57:40,353 --> 00:57:43,650
And we are not going to rush 
in to doing anything that doesn't

856
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:47,371
take into account the security measures
that the Police Department

857
00:57:47,371 --> 00:57:50,189
and plenty of other people 
think are appropriate.

00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:56,391
<i>- [Lieber] It's impossible to describe</i>
the frustration that we all felt.

859
00:57:56,391 --> 00:58:00,419
In fact, we had to go back
and come up with a new building.

860
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,120
- [Silverstein] I was crushed by it,
literally crushed.

861
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:08,784
I felt it was terribly unfair 
and a tragic waste of time,

862
00:58:08,784 --> 00:58:12,029
effort, energy and money,
that was needed for the purpose

863
00:58:12,029 --> 00:58:13,489
of rebuilding the World Trade Center.

864
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:16,658
- [Childs] That changed 
the game, entirely.

865
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:20,772
Because we couldn't modify the building.
We couldn't move it onto another site,

866
00:58:20,772 --> 00:58:24,165
so we were in effect by that decision

867
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:30,646
given a clean slate of
clean sheet of paper to work on.

868
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:35,546
<i>- [Lieber] The building moved</i>
to the east away from the road.

869
00:58:35,893 --> 00:58:40,361
<i>And then, we came up</i>
with a completely new design.

870
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:44,540
- [Anchorman] New York officials today
unveil the latest redesign

871
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,027
of the Freedom Tower to be built 
in Ground Zero with the reinforced

872
00:58:48,027 --> 00:58:54,420
<i>concrete base for bomb protection.</i>
The tower will be 1776 feet tall,

873
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,994
<i>its proportions and external skin</i>
recalling the lost Twin Towers.

874
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:02,753
<i>- [Ringler] I could remember</i>
shuttling back and forth

875
00:59:02,753 --> 00:59:06,210
<i>between Daniel and David,</i>
trying to get Daniel to say

876
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,205
<i>that this is a beautiful building</i>

877
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:10,929
and you know, and he kept looking in.
Finally, he said,

878
00:59:10,929 --> 00:59:12,817
"Yeah, I think I like it.
I think I like it."

879
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:15,844
So, I said, I called up 
Governor's office and said,

880
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,332
"Dan is gonna say nice things. I think 
we're not gonna have an issue here."

881
00:59:18,332 --> 00:59:20,711
- [Libeskind] The tower that we have now,
after all the efforts,

882
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:23,289
is even a better tower 
than we have before.

883
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:25,920
It is a slender tower,
it's an elegant tower,

884
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,882
it's a tower that rises 
in a crystal-like form--

885
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:29,911
<i>- [Betts] Daniel Libeskind was part</i>
of that in name only.

886
00:59:29,911 --> 00:59:34,224
<i>He had absolutely nothing to do with </i>
what we now know as the Freedom Tower.

887
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,819
<i>All that's left of Libeskind's influence</i>
is the height of the building.

888
00:59:37,858 --> 00:59:38,744
[cameras clicking]

889
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:44,720
<i>- [Lieber] The new design was rolled out</i>
without people criticizing it

890
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,979
<i>and we were back in business,</i>
and in fact, building.

891
00:59:48,594 --> 00:59:51,173
<i>- [Anchorman] Well, today our Federal Jury</i>
decided that for insurance purposes,

892
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:55,149
the destruction of the World Trade Center
was two separate events, not one,

893
00:59:55,149 --> 00:59:57,128
as insurance companies were hoping for.

894
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,958
And this means the lease holder, 
Larry Silverstein can collect twice

895
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:03,480
from some companies because
separate planes hit the two towers.

896
01:00:03,095 --> 01:00:06,640
This decision is the latest twist
to Silverstein's effort to turn his

897
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,369
$3.5 billion insurance policy
on the Trade Center Complex,

898
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:12,660
into a $7 billion payout.

899
01:00:12,774 --> 01:00:16,544
- [Lieber] And in the end, we ended up
recovering the equivalent of about

900
01:00:16,544 --> 01:00:20,442
one and a half, 
$4.5 billion dollars of insurance.

901
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:23,433
And mind you, that $4.5 billion 
sounds like a lot of money,

902
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:27,669
but it's not enough money to rebuild
the office space that was destroyed.

903
01:00:27,954 --> 01:00:30,265
- [Ringer] It was decided 
to approach him and say,

904
01:00:30,265 --> 01:00:35,250
"Can we re-negotiate the deal and 
perhaps, lessen your rental obligations,

905
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,955
and return some of the sites 
to the Port Authority

906
01:00:38,955 --> 01:00:41,382
who would then go on 
and develop them."

907
01:00:42,048 --> 01:00:43,295
2006

908
01:00:43,455 --> 01:00:45,650
<i>- [Anchorwoman] A deal must be reached</i>
today between World Trade Center

909
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,491
<i>lease holder Larry Silverstein</i>
and the Port Authority

910
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:48,891
<i>which owns the land</i>

911
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:51,332
<i>on what to do with the site</i>
beyond the Memorial.

912
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,534
<i>Governor Pataki set</i>
the March 14th deadline last year,

913
01:00:54,534 --> 01:00:56,810
<i>in an effort to get</i>
the rebuilding ball rolling.

914
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:00,475
- [Lieber] We gave them proposal after 
proposal, we couldn't get any response.

915
01:01:00,475 --> 01:01:04,320
And they left everything to, 
literally, the last two days.

916
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,360
- [Ringler] We got to the 
day of the deadline

917
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:10,750
and our teams were working 
all day at our offices.

918
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,315
<i>And I was there. I was going from room</i>
to room and we were progressing.

919
01:01:14,315 --> 01:01:18,640
We broke for dinner and hoped 
everybody would be back

920
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,429
by 7:00 or so, and we were gonna 
continue the discussions

921
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:24,105
and hopefully consummate a deal.

922
01:01:25,134 --> 01:01:28,333
And I ordered pizza out for our folks

923
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,838
and we sat around the
conference table eating pizza.

924
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:34,148
As I read later, Larry 
and his team were so ecstatic,

925
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,376
they ordered from a French restaurant
and had a party.

926
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:39,916
And they didn't come back.

927
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:43,260
<i>We kept calling, asking,"Where are you?"</i>

928
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,220
"We're meeting with our key people.
We'll be there. We'll be there."

929
01:01:46,606 --> 01:01:51,343
<i>- [Lieber] And we came back and it was</i>
about 9:00 or so, 9:00 to 9:30.

930
01:01:51,343 --> 01:01:55,470
Larry Silverstein sat down,
drank two cups of coffee

931
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,977
'cause he thought we were gonna
be there for a long time.

932
01:01:57,977 --> 01:02:02,263
- [Ringler] And I think he and his team,
again, it's only my perception,

933
01:02:02,263 --> 01:02:04,805
felt that because there was a deadline
and that we wanted to honor

934
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:09,520
the Governor's wishes, that perhaps there 
was more nickels on the table for him.

935
01:02:11,005 --> 01:02:15,986
<i>I walked down the hall and Larry</i>
and his team were sitting at the table.

936
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:18,412
Everybody's sitting around there, smiling.

937
01:02:18,412 --> 01:02:25,445
And I think I felt like an ancient Roman
going into the Colosseum with the lions.

938
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:29,740
- [Lieber] Ken Ringler came into that
conference room, where we were sitting.

939
01:02:30,263 --> 01:02:36,876
And in very blue language, told us 
to get the "F" outta his office,

940
01:02:36,876 --> 01:02:42,651
to pay our "effing" rent, and you know, 
we were a bunch of bums

941
01:02:42,651 --> 01:02:45,639
and they were coming after us.

942
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:48,539
- [Silverstein] All I remember
was being surprised as hell.

943
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:50,182
Because we genuinely were there

944
01:02:50,182 --> 01:02:54,331
for the purpose of making a deal
with the Port that night, clearly.

945
01:02:57,714 --> 01:03:01,270
And it made no sense to me, 
literally made no sense.

946
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:03,880
And then of course, the next day,
diffused a lot.

947
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,663
- [Ringler] We thought we were moving
in the right direction.

948
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:08,430
Then at 11:35 was it, Sir?
- [speaker] 11:35.

949
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:11,615
11:35, they came back with a proposal,
where their demands

950
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,987
were just as high as they were before,

951
01:03:13,987 --> 01:03:17,452
they're increasing their demands, 
and quite honestly, in my view,

952
01:03:17,452 --> 01:03:20,142
I think they thought they had leverage 
that we were going to back down

953
01:03:20,142 --> 01:03:22,415
because we wanted to get a deal

954
01:03:22,415 --> 01:03:24,859
and we wanted to move
the Freedom Tower forward.

955
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:27,961
We're not going to make short-sight
a deal with Larry Silverstein.

956
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:31,510
- [Silverstein] Negotiation with 
the Port collapsed.

957
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,881
Next thing I know, <i>New York Times,</i>

958
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:37,100
"Governor to Larry Silverstein:
Stand Aside.

959
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,959
You're obstructing progress at the site."

960
01:03:40,878 --> 01:03:42,402
Oh, my God.

961
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,642
- [Ringler] Larry was losing 
the public battle.

962
01:03:44,642 --> 01:03:47,673
And within days, there was a
<i>New York Times</i> editorial,

963
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:50,357
<i>the political leaders galvanized</i>
around it and said,

964
01:03:50,357 --> 01:03:52,233
<i>"No. Enough is enough."</i>

965
01:03:52,233 --> 01:03:56,785
We decided to put an agreement together
and bring it back to Larry

966
01:03:56,785 --> 01:04:01,130
and basically, not say take it 
or leave it, but as I told Larry

967
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,659
when I brought it up to him,

968
01:04:02,659 --> 01:04:06,123
"It's this close to take it or leave it
as we're gonna get."

969
01:04:06,123 --> 01:04:07,491
- [Chuck Scarborough] Good evening.

970
01:04:07,491 --> 01:04:09,895
An agreement between World Trade Center
developer Larry Silverstein

971
01:04:09,895 --> 01:04:12,856
and the Port Authority, means
construction on the Freedom Tower

972
01:04:12,856 --> 01:04:15,721
could finally begin. 
Perhaps, by week's end.

973
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:18,500
- [Sue Simmons] The deal will give
Port Authority control

974
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,840
of the long-delayed Freedom Tower,
but reward Silverstein with three

975
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,437
other prime developing sites along
the eastern side of Ground Zero.

976
01:04:25,621 --> 01:04:28,603
<i>- [Silverstein] That was when</i>
we relinquished control of

977
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:32,682
<i>The Freedom Tower and Tower 5</i>
and kept Towers 2, 3 and 4.

978
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:35,857
<i>Did we think it was fair? Not necessarily.</i>

979
01:04:35,857 --> 01:04:38,468
<i>But the important thing was</i>
to keep the momentum going.

980
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:42,933
- [Lieber] What we got out of the deal 
was a commitment by the Port Authority

981
01:04:42,933 --> 01:04:46,272
<i>that they would dig the hole</i>
on the east side of the site.

982
01:04:46,272 --> 01:04:49,690
<i>The 80-foot hole and put</i>
in the infrastructure and fully prepare

983
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:53,440
<i>those sites for construction.</i>

984
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:55,517
- [Jon Stewart] If you remember,
New York City was attacked

985
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,761
four and a half years ago
and since that time,

986
01:04:57,761 --> 01:05:03,700
we have been locked in a vicious
battle over construction of the

987
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,631
<i>tallest, shiniest, terrorist,</i>
tauntiest skyscraper in the world.

988
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:07,799
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

989
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:11,152
<i>The 1776 foot tall Freedom Tower!</i>

990
01:05:11,152 --> 01:05:13,266
- [Pataki] Today, we lay the cornerstone

991
01:05:13,266 --> 01:05:16,443
<i>for a new symbol of the city</i>
and of this country,

992
01:05:16,443 --> 01:05:19,986
<i>and of our resolve</i>
to triumph in the face of terror.

993
01:05:20,479 --> 01:05:22,953
<i>- [Stewart] So that was the site</i>
two years ago.

994
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:24,513
<i>And today...Oh!</i>

995
01:05:24,513 --> 01:05:25,976
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

996
01:05:25,976 --> 01:05:27,567
[cameras clicking]

997
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,845
- [speaker] Governor, good morning.
- [Pataki] Good morning.

998
01:05:33,091 --> 01:05:35,948
Good morning. 
This is a great day for New York

999
01:05:35,948 --> 01:05:38,810
and a great day for America.
Today, we begin construction

1000
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,190
on the Freedom Tower,the final element--

1001
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:45,218
- [Betts] When the press would start
ranting and raving about no progress,

1002
01:05:45,218 --> 01:05:49,889
there'd be a ceremony.
I never went to any of them.

1003
01:05:49,889 --> 01:05:52,652
[excavator engine running]

1004
01:05:52,652 --> 01:05:54,787
[applause]

1005
01:05:54,787 --> 01:05:56,355
<i>- [Raab] The cornerstone had to come out </i>

1006
01:05:56,355 --> 01:05:59,859
<i>because the Freedom Tower</i>
had to be redesigned.

1007
01:05:59,859 --> 01:06:02,800
<i>The cornerstone had been</i>
sitting in a plywood box.

1008
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:08,223
<i>They're taking this thing out,</i>
not literally under the cover of night,

1009
01:06:08,223 --> 01:06:10,869
<i>but goddamn close to the cover of night.</i>

1010
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:13,966
No one is supposed to know that
they're pulling the--

1011
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:18,448
it's too much of an embarrassment
to let anyone in the media know

1012
01:06:18,448 --> 01:06:19,944
that this is going to happen.

1013
01:06:20,205 --> 01:06:23,543
<i>- [Reporter] What became</i>
of the cornerstone itself?

1014
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:26,464
- [Pataki] I honestly don't know,
but to me, I thought it would be nice

1015
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:31,452
to have it in the lobby of the actual 
Freedom Tower that's constructed.

1016
01:06:31,452 --> 01:06:36,270
I haven't had a chance to 
talk to David Childs about it.

1017
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,661
- [Raab] My joke was always driving
to Pataki's house.

1018
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,507
You know, and put it down his front lawn.

1019
01:06:40,507 --> 01:06:43,660
Ring the doorbell and drive away
as fast as you can.

1020
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:49,410
[laughs]

1021
01:06:50,768 --> 01:06:56,544
<i>[crowd applauding and cheering]</i>

1022
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:07,160
- <i>[speaker] One , two, done. [crowd cheering]</i>

1023
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:10,750
<i>- [Raab] One of the ironies is</i>
during the middle of all the drama

1024
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:14,755
<i>back in the spring of '06,</i>
we opened 7 World Trade Center.

1025
01:07:14,755 --> 01:07:17,840
- [Betts] That's the best thing Larry did,
was he went in.

1026
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,962
He just plowed ahead, 
rebuilt World Trade Center number 7.

1027
01:07:20,962 --> 01:07:25,308
I think that was important for the public
to see construction and to see action

1028
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:28,919
down there and to see something
coming out of the ground.

1029
01:07:29,426 --> 01:07:33,594
<i>- [Lieber] It saw a finished product.</i>
It saw something that was high-style

1030
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:38,642
<i>that was green and that gave confidence</i>
that downtown could

1031
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,379
<i>and would be reborn</i>
as a business district.

1032
01:07:42,594 --> 01:07:45,177
<i>- [Silverstein] And they looked at</i>
what was going on across the street.

1033
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:48,692
<i>Havoc. I mean, just disaster</i>
across the street, right?

1034
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:52,228
<i> They knowing it was the Port.</i>
Here, we finished a building.

1035
01:07:52,228 --> 01:07:54,100
And all of a sudden, 
people startled and said,

1036
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,953
"What's he doing that's so bad?
What's he doing so wrong?

1037
01:07:56,953 --> 01:07:59,730
Maybe he's the problem."
People started looking and saying,

1038
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:01,650
"Maybe it's he's not the problem."

1039
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:05,894
[water flowing]

1040
01:08:14,668 --> 01:08:17,816
<i>- [Arad] The design initially suggested</i>
these Memorial galleries,

1041
01:08:17,816 --> 01:08:21,486
<i>which would surround the pools</i>
some 30 feet below the plaza.

1042
01:08:21,855 --> 01:08:25,200
And so the idea was that
you would walk up to the--

1043
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:30,187
adrift of these voids, 
sort of peer down below

1044
01:08:30,187 --> 01:08:35,544
and then go on this very,
you know, emotionally fraught

1045
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:39,720
processional experience and sort of 
walking into the area almost

1046
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,865
<i>walking right up to the names,</i>
which would be displayed

1047
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:47,975
<i>behind the waterfalls in this</i>
very sort of quiet, cloister-like space.

1048
01:08:49,605 --> 01:08:53,297
<i>- [Rosaleen] In advocating</i>
for the ranks of the firefighters,

1049
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:57,570
we were invited to Michael Arad's office 
to speak of that

1050
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,206
and we were in the meeting room,
in the conference room,

1051
01:09:00,206 --> 01:09:03,964
and you know, all around were 
aspects of the Memorial.

1052
01:09:03,964 --> 01:09:09,515
<i>But there was a three dimensional model</i>
of the Memorial.

1053
01:09:09,515 --> 01:09:13,724
<i>And up to that point, none of us had really</i>
questioned where the names were going.

1054
01:09:13,724 --> 01:09:17,797
But then we saw the three dimensional 
model and we realized

1055
01:09:17,797 --> 01:09:22,400
the names were gonna be 
underneath the waterfalls

1056
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,379
at the base of the waterfalls,
underground.

1057
01:09:24,379 --> 01:09:29,227
<i>You would have to descend down, almost</i>
as though, you were going into the subway.

1058
01:09:29,227 --> 01:09:34,429
<i>Descend down underground,</i>
into a confined space to view the names.

1059
01:09:34,429 --> 01:09:37,689
<i>And that shocked us.</i>

1060
01:09:38,805 --> 01:09:45,830
Knowing now about 1993, 
about 2001, I will never go down.

1061
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:48,890
I will never bring my children 
underground at Ground Zero

1062
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:54,212
because I feel it's always gonna be the
number one target site of the terrorists.

1063
01:09:54,212 --> 01:09:55,819
<i>They've come twice.</i>

1064
01:09:55,819 --> 01:09:59,624
<i>What better place than to get us</i>
all while we're underground.

1065
01:09:59,624 --> 01:10:02,787
I mean, it just-- 
it never made sense to me.

1066
01:10:03,986 --> 01:10:09,254
<i>- [Arad] It'll be so easy for this design</i>
to be changed in a fundamental way.

1067
01:10:09,254 --> 01:10:13,299
And you know, while every 
suggestion that was made,

1068
01:10:13,299 --> 01:10:15,929
was made by somebody who cares deeply 
about the Memorial,

1069
01:10:15,929 --> 01:10:20,454
was not necessarily consistent
with the design that was selected

1070
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:25,833
and then I felt it was my obligation
to champion and be responsible for it.

1071
01:10:27,209 --> 01:10:30,547
<i>How do you build a moment of silence?</i>
This is what this is.

1072
01:10:35,284 --> 01:10:37,859
- [speaker] Write down the ideas,
because you know, four hours from now--

1073
01:10:39,814 --> 01:10:42,724
This is America's Memorial, 
as they all like to say.

1074
01:10:42,724 --> 01:10:44,723
America doesn't know what she's getting.

1075
01:10:44,723 --> 01:10:47,144
New York is on now, an American self now.

1076
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,427
<i>- [Man] That's insane.</i>
- [Rosaleen] Thank you very much.

1077
01:10:50,427 --> 01:10:53,312
<i>Do you know they're spending</i>
$1.2 billion on this?

1078
01:10:53,312 --> 01:10:55,874
- [speaker] On a Memorial 
that nobody wants.

1079
01:10:55,874 --> 01:10:57,917
- [Rosaleen] We bring out 
the sleeping bags

1080
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:02,361
and we bring out warmer clothes
to spend the night here.

1081
01:11:04,129 --> 01:11:07,086
9/11 families have always been 
somewhat out in the public but

1082
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:11,256
this was taking a step where people 
could really be critical of you saying

1083
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:14,153
that you had flipped your lid, you know.

1084
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:15,578
And you know, you could feel that.

1085
01:11:15,578 --> 01:11:18,850
You could feel that,
"Maybe, I'm so deep into this.

1086
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,527
Maybe, I'm carrying it too far."

1087
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:27,710
But the first nights down there,
I knew that it was the right thing to do.

1088
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:35,999
<i>We looked out into the vast openness</i>
and we could just say

1089
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:37,733
<i>this was their spot</i>

1090
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,817
<i>and we're defending it.</i>

1091
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:49,328
<i>- [Reporter] They're being touted</i>
as the last pieces

1092
01:11:49,328 --> 01:11:51,242
<i>in the rebirth of Lower Manhattan.</i>

1093
01:11:51,242 --> 01:11:56,131
<i>The three towers: 2, 3 and 4 will replace</i>
about 6 million square feet

1094
01:11:56,131 --> 01:11:58,397
<i>of the 10 million destroyed in the attack.</i>

1095
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:01,768
<i>Norman Foster's tower is the largest</i>
of the three buildings.

1096
01:12:01,768 --> 01:12:03,992
<i>It's taller than the Empire State Building</i>

1097
01:12:03,992 --> 01:12:06,483
<i>and has diamond-like paneling</i>
along the top.

1098
01:12:06,483 --> 01:12:09,424
<i>Richard Roger's tower</i>
is far sleeker in design.

1099
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:11,787
<i>Fumihiko Maki's is the first to be built,</i>

1100
01:12:11,787 --> 01:12:13,900
<i>will have a restaurant</i>
with panoramic views.

1101
01:12:14,423 --> 01:12:16,400
- [Silverstein] Good morning.
- [speaker] Mr. Damian, you know.

1102
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,475
- Hello, Damian.
- [Damian] Hi.

1103
01:12:17,475 --> 01:12:20,569
- HI, buddy. How are you?
Okay.

1104
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,331
- [speaker] We're in deep discussion
with the Board

1105
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:25,324
and the transit authority's
about that.

1106
01:12:25,324 --> 01:12:29,174
- [Silverstein] We have less congestion
by pulling this in

1107
01:12:29,174 --> 01:12:31,163
and having these out here.

1108
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:36,331
All during this time, we're plowing ahead,
plowing ahead.

1109
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:39,450
Because we have--Governor said
we design, finish plans,

1110
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,666
specification and so forth 
for Towers 2, 3 and 4.

1111
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:45,646
We did them, 18 months we finished
the plans, specifications, done.

1112
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:48,139
All right. Ready to go.
Ready to shovel the ground.

1113
01:12:48,139 --> 01:12:51,395
Is this width the same
as this width?

1114
01:12:51,395 --> 01:12:55,306
And guess what?
No ground on which to put a shovel.

1115
01:12:55,306 --> 01:12:57,330
Why? Because the sites aren't ready.

1116
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:59,201
The sites the Port Authority's 
suppose to deliver to us.

1117
01:12:59,201 --> 01:13:00,549
Not ready.

1118
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:02,843
<i>We know what it takes to dig a hole.</i>

1119
01:13:02,843 --> 01:13:05,487
<i>But for some reason, your people,</i>
they're taking longer.

1120
01:13:05,487 --> 01:13:08,877
Much longer than it has
 ever been taken, right?

1121
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:10,420
What's taking so long?

1122
01:13:12,898 --> 01:13:15,728
<i>- [Lieber] What happened was they had</i>
another groundbreaking.

1123
01:13:16,866 --> 01:13:21,313
And they started construction of
this PATH Train Station,

1124
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,715
<i>designed by Santiago Calatrava.</i>

1125
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,144
<i>- [Pataki] And I remember</i>
the Port Authority had,

1126
01:13:28,144 --> 01:13:30,310
<i>going to Santiago and saying,</i>

1127
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:34,344
"Is it expensive?" and he said,
"Of course, it is."

1128
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:41,809
<i>- [Raab] Okay, build me the world's</i>
most expensive subway stop.

1129
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:46,666
Two billion dollar?
No, make it $4 billion.
The wings are going to open

1130
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:50,625
like a dove twice a year
or maybe not.

1131
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:55,440
<i>- [Lieber] And what increasingly became clear</i>
is that this train station,

1132
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,591
which they called, "The Oculus,"
because of its shape,

1133
01:13:58,591 --> 01:14:02,817
was actually an octopus that was
killing all the other projects around it

1134
01:14:02,817 --> 01:14:06,358
<i>because they were sticking</i>
all their mechanical system,

1135
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:09,612
<i>their air condition, their heating,</i>
to support this train station,

1136
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,688
<i>were being pushed into other buildings.</i>

1137
01:14:12,688 --> 01:14:15,566
<i>It was creating all kinds</i>
of complexities and delays.

1138
01:14:17,734 --> 01:14:19,787
2008

1139
01:14:19,987 --> 01:14:23,434
<i>- [David Paterson] In my perusal,</i>
just in the first days of my administration,

1140
01:14:23,434 --> 01:14:28,797
I couldn't really find anyone that
knew what was being built,

1141
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:31,885
who was building it,
when it would be completed

1142
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:36,880
and how and what fashion
it would actually be erected.

1143
01:14:39,702 --> 01:14:42,086
- [worker] Wonderful time.
- [Chris Ward] Sir. Good.

1144
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:46,820
<i>- [Lieber] And one of the first things</i>
that Paterson did when he came in,

1145
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:51,310
<i>was to replace the head</i>
of the Port Authority

1146
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,366
<i>with a new guy named, Chris Ward.</i>

1147
01:14:54,499 --> 01:14:56,608
- [Ward] It's great they're all tied off.

1148
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:03,192
We wanted it to be symbolic.

1149
01:15:03,192 --> 01:15:05,634
We wanted it to be monumental.

1150
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:09,372
That could've and should've
remained at a certain level,

1151
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:12,330
but it became to dominate
the whole project literally

1152
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:16,502
right down into the ground and when 
it dominated it down into the ground,

1153
01:15:16,502 --> 01:15:22,802
the project lost its logic,
it lost its constructability.

1154
01:15:22,802 --> 01:15:25,339
- [Raab] Chris Ward's a guy who's
smart enough to come into the office

1155
01:15:25,339 --> 01:15:27,694
and recognize that 
everyone had been lying.

1156
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:30,377
Everyone had been 
bullshitting for years.

1157
01:15:30,377 --> 01:15:32,849
Everyone had held press conferences,
and made promises,

1158
01:15:32,849 --> 01:15:36,896
and none of those press conferences
meant a goddamn thing

1159
01:15:36,896 --> 01:15:38,945
and none of those promises 
could be kept.

1160
01:15:38,945 --> 01:15:41,489
- [Paterson] After looking at the
construction solutions,

1161
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:45,404
that Chris Ward and the staff of
the Port Authority

1162
01:15:45,404 --> 01:15:50,955
have been able to establish,
I am comfortable today

1163
01:15:50,955 --> 01:15:54,633
by telling you that on 
September 11th, 2011,

1164
01:15:54,633 --> 01:16:00,670
ten years to the date of that disaster,
there will be an open memorial

1165
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:03,805
at Ground Zero to those
 who lost their lives that day.

1166
01:16:04,745 --> 01:16:08,438
<i>- [Ward] We made a major commitment</i>
that the plaza would be open

1167
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,658
<i>on the ten-year anniversary.</i>

1168
01:16:10,658 --> 01:16:13,115
<i>The fountains would be functioning,</i>
the water would fall

1169
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:15,924
<i>and that was the commitment we made.</i>

1170
01:16:15,924 --> 01:16:21,180
But it was a lot more complicated
and there was some real fundamental

1171
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:26,674
disconnects in what had to get built
and how it would get built

1172
01:16:26,674 --> 01:16:30,778
and who would build it, that had
to really get completely sorted out.

1173
01:16:30,778 --> 01:16:34,250
- [Silverstein] Things were sliding
further and further and further behind

1174
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:37,507
as we progressed, right? As the days 
went by, the days, the months.

1175
01:16:38,968 --> 01:16:43,157
<i>- [Ward] The Mayor, advocate for the city,</i>
saw that things were in fact, stalled,

1176
01:16:43,157 --> 01:16:47,183
took it upon himself to bring us 
together in a Gracie Mansion Summit.

1177
01:16:47,398 --> 01:16:50,841
<i>He brought the Governors together</i>
from both States.

1178
01:16:50,841 --> 01:16:53,633
<i>He brought Larry and he brought me there.</i>

1179
01:16:54,586 --> 01:16:57,320
- [Bloomberg] When they're not
making progress, just shake things up.

1180
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,646
You put them in a room with a 
big pot of coffee

1181
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:02,889
and lock the doors with no bathroom.
You'd be surprised how quickly

1182
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:04,229
they come to an agreement.

1183
01:17:05,543 --> 01:17:07,710
<i>- [Ward] It was one of those moments</i>
that I'm sure the Mayor

1184
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:10,350
<i>was very, very disappointed,</i>
if you go to Gracie Mansion,

1185
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:13,368
<i>the whole idea is you have success</i>
when you leave.

1186
01:17:13,368 --> 01:17:16,435
But you couldn't on that day, 
solve all the problems

1187
01:17:16,435 --> 01:17:18,649
as the Mayor had hoped we would.

1188
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:24,993
- [Lieber] At some point, you know,
the anger gives way to just depression

1189
01:17:24,993 --> 01:17:27,925
because you think, "How are we gonna
ever get out of this?"

1190
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:31,771
[crowd cheering and applauding]

1191
01:17:32,048 --> 01:17:34,264
- [speaker] Let me hear you 
one more time.

1192
01:17:34,264 --> 01:17:36,599
Wouldn't we want these jobs?
[crowd shouting] No!

1193
01:17:36,599 --> 01:17:39,451
Wouldn't we want these jobs?
[crowd shouting] No!

1194
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:42,990
<i>- [speaker] The finger pointing</i>
has got to stop.

1195
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:48,334
That's almost nine years after 9/11,
instead of a shiny symbol of

1196
01:17:48,334 --> 01:17:52,786
American resilience and strength,
we have a hole in the ground.

1197
01:17:52,786 --> 01:17:55,381
[cheering and applause]

1198
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:59,627
<i>- [Lieber] The construction workers</i>
in New York were so out of work.

1199
01:17:59,627 --> 01:18:03,947
<i>At this point, this six months</i>
after Lehman Brothers went down

1200
01:18:03,947 --> 01:18:07,815
<i>and we're in the middle</i>
of this incredible economic collapse.

1201
01:18:07,815 --> 01:18:11,459
- [Ward] And you could take a 
pessimistic view and go,

1202
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:15,215
<i>"You know, maybe this worldwide recession</i>
is gonna be deep.

1203
01:18:15,215 --> 01:18:18,715
<i>It's gonna be long and that we're not</i>
gonna come out of it quickly."

1204
01:18:18,715 --> 01:18:21,620
<i>We had a study that said,</i>
"Maybe the market's not back

1205
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,253
all the way until 2037.

1206
01:18:24,253 --> 01:18:30,480
- [Lieber] People were not down for
waiting another 25 years

1207
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,687
to get the World Trade Center rebuilt.

1208
01:18:33,687 --> 01:18:36,431
[crowd chanting] Build it now!
Build it now!

1209
01:18:36,431 --> 01:18:39,779
Build it now!
Build it now!

1210
01:18:39,779 --> 01:18:44,853
- [Ward] It was kind of a great moment
because everybody's chanting,

1211
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:48,937
<i> "Build it now!" And I was like,</i>
"Who are they talking to?"

1212
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:54,200
They were talking to me because 
I was the one guy who was there

1213
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,847
that would answer the question,
"Could you build it now?"

1214
01:18:56,847 --> 01:19:00,772
<i>They were convinced that we were</i>
the ones who were slowing it down.

1215
01:19:01,386 --> 01:19:09,659
- [speaker] We need the Hirsch, Chris,
Larry, the city, to get back at the table

1216
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:14,505
to find a solution so that these 
two towers can be built

1217
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:17,386
and they can be built now.

1218
01:19:17,614 --> 01:19:21,595
- [Lieber] No more excuses. It's time 
for us to all put our shoulders

1219
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:24,119
so that we all work together
to get the job done.

1220
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:26,663
And I think that was a game changer.

1221
01:19:27,331 --> 01:19:29,302
- [Paterson] And today, we have found
an agreement

1222
01:19:29,302 --> 01:19:35,130
that we feel will allow us 
to complete the reconstruction

1223
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:37,676
of the World Trade Center's site.

1224
01:19:40,044 --> 01:19:43,226
- [Ward] Wow. This is progress.

1225
01:19:44,195 --> 01:19:48,363
This is probably the most important
part of the project from the

1226
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:52,999
Port Authority's commitment to
deliver the plaza for the anniversary.

1227
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:56,961
We have to have this done or
the plaza will not be completed.

1228
01:19:56,961 --> 01:19:58,942
But you stand here and think,

1229
01:19:58,942 --> 01:20:01,650
"Are they gonna be able 
to get it all done?"

1230
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:09,634
We're doing really well. I have no 
expectation that we won't deliver

1231
01:20:09,634 --> 01:20:13,894
but, imagine it if we don't?

1232
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:37,509
- [Jim] What's up, V.?
- [V.] How's it going, Jim?

1233
01:20:37,509 --> 01:20:38,526
How are you, buddy?

1234
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:40,894
- [worker] I got it right here.

1235
01:20:40,894 --> 01:20:44,207
The one coming through 
from this way here is sided.

1236
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:46,200
- [Jim] Okay, all right.

1237
01:20:46,938 --> 01:20:49,803
[crackling metal sound]

1238
01:20:56,527 --> 01:20:59,941
I gotta get all the way out to the street
 five feet by today, alright?

1239
01:21:00,462 --> 01:21:03,515
Bob, we need those two
beehive strainers.

1240
01:21:06,468 --> 01:21:08,111
When you look at it like this,

1241
01:21:08,111 --> 01:21:11,620
it's just amazing how many 
people killed that day.

1242
01:21:14,235 --> 01:21:17,570
Well, I lost my mother on 9/11.
She was on the 94th floor

1243
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:21,567
of the North Tower. 
I don't know what to say.

1244
01:21:21,567 --> 01:21:26,460
That's just hard to imagine
it's ten years already. It really is.

1245
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:29,945
It's what we have right here.

1246
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:50,628
- [Arad] Reading the names
 up to the plaza,

1247
01:21:50,628 --> 01:21:53,650
when that decision was made
against my wishes,

1248
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:56,600
it felt like a tremendous blow.

1249
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:04,504
And you know-- but if it is a child,
if it is your child and it's injured,

1250
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:09,323
you don't walk away from it,
 you stay involved. You keep caring.

1251
01:22:15,091 --> 01:22:19,647
My hope is when the memorial opens up,
whatever dissatisfaction's had been

1252
01:22:19,647 --> 01:22:23,175
expressed up until now, some of this
here's might be assuaged.

1253
01:22:24,882 --> 01:22:28,400
We'll see, I mean that's the missing 
ingredient for the memorial right now,

1254
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,430
it's that interaction between 
the public and the memorial.

1255
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:39,700
And what you have right now is 
the stage that's set for that encounter.

1256
01:22:41,747 --> 01:22:45,234
SEPTEMBER 11, 2011

1257
01:22:47,059 --> 01:22:49,523
[crickets chirping]

1258
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,924
Bye, sweetie. I'm leaving now.

1259
01:22:54,486 --> 01:22:58,069
[door opens
then closes]

1260
01:23:00,546 --> 01:23:06,323
<i>You know, last night at 11:00 or so,</i>
all of a sudden I sort of had this urge

1261
01:23:06,323 --> 01:23:09,712
<i> to jump in the car and drive to see the site</i>
to make sure that everything's there.

1262
01:23:11,204 --> 01:23:13,186
You know, sort of last minute--

1263
01:23:16,678 --> 01:23:19,372
You wanna make sure 
everything is just right.

1264
01:23:23,969 --> 01:23:25,975
[Sean giggling]

1265
01:23:25,975 --> 01:23:28,658
- [Sean] Ahh...

1266
01:23:30,042 --> 01:23:31,503
- [Rosaleen] Sean?

1267
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:34,815
[scraping sound]

1268
01:23:36,055 --> 01:23:39,890
You put on Uncle Sean's shirt?
You can put on Uncle Sean's shirt.

1269
01:23:47,488 --> 01:23:50,820
<i>- [Arad] Today's gonna be</i>
really difficult.

1270
01:23:51,398 --> 01:23:53,224
<i>But it's the moment I've been waiting for.</i>

1271
01:23:55,121 --> 01:23:57,849
<i>- [Judey] I want that one, please.</i>

1272
01:23:57,849 --> 01:23:59,396
<i>- [Rosaleen] Please have</i>
a couple of bites, Sean.

1273
01:23:59,396 --> 01:24:02,347
I'll give Panny then, a little bit 
of your English muffin.

1274
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:04,540
- [Sean] They had a truck in those 
bunks in the truck

1275
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,828
and they move it into the garage.

1276
01:24:06,828 --> 01:24:09,291
- [Rosaleen] You know, Daddy went 
over there to see

1277
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:11,573
if he could find Uncle Sean. 
I don't know if you ever knew that.

1278
01:24:11,573 --> 01:24:13,276
- [Judey] He did?

1279
01:24:13,276 --> 01:24:14,752
- [Rob Tallon] Yeah.
- I never knew that.

1280
01:24:16,107 --> 01:24:18,662
<i>- [Rosaleen] It would be nice</i>
to see Uncle Sean's name, right?

1281
01:24:18,662 --> 01:24:20,084
- [Judey] Yeah.

1282
01:24:40,084 --> 01:24:40,983
- [Silverstein] Thank you.

1283
01:24:40,983 --> 01:24:41,899
[car door closes]

1284
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:01,700
<i>- [Rosaleen] Guys,</i>
ain't it a beautiful day?

1285
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,163
<i>- [Eileen] Oh, yes.</i>
- They had predicted rain for

1286
01:25:03,163 --> 01:25:05,194
yesterday and today.

1287
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:14,568
<i>- [Silverstein] Go on,</i>
just go pass them slowly.

1288
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:17,006
Go further.

1289
01:25:17,006 --> 01:25:21,549
You're gonna go straight to Denmar.

1290
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,303
<i>- [woman] Good morning.</i>
- [driver] Good morning, ma'am.

1291
01:25:23,303 --> 01:25:25,485
- <i>How are you?</i>
- [Silverstein] Silverstein!

1292
01:25:25,485 --> 01:25:27,150
<i>- Straight ahead, Sir.</i>
- Thank you.

1293
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:28,065
<i>- Okay. - [driver] Thank you. </i>

1294
01:25:28,065 --> 01:25:29,235
<i>- Have a great day.- Likewise, ma'am.</i>

1295
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:38,647
- [Eileen] He was just beaming that
morning. He was all lit up

1296
01:25:38,647 --> 01:25:44,285
in the house, had such a smile.
He was wearing his lovely shirt

Where's Grandma?
Keep Grandma with us.

1300

01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:31,664
- [Arad] It's easy to think about all the
strife, all the disagreement,

1310
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:35,607
<i>to sort of focus on, "Well, you know,</i>
this didn't go right, that didn't go right."

1311
01:27:35,607 --> 01:27:39,049
<i>Actually, the big picture is something</i>
went right, really right.

1312
01:27:55,102 --> 01:27:58,149
- [Silverstein] At the end of the day, 
it's a good thing to see,

1313
01:27:58,149 --> 01:28:01,232
everything out moving down the track

1314
01:28:01,232 --> 01:28:04,996
and getting built because
this is important to New York.

1315
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:10,340
You have to develop very thick skin,

1316
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,461
really take a long view,
a very long view.

1317
01:28:15,454 --> 01:28:17,679
And praises? White noise.

1318
01:28:31,309 --> 01:28:33,290
<i>- [Rosaleen] That's Sean's name.</i>

1319
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:37,223
I mean, he's one of these people 
listed on this memorial.

1320
01:28:37,223 --> 01:28:40,102
That's the shocker, I think.
You know, you say,

1321
01:28:40,102 --> 01:28:44,960
"God, that was my flesh and blood
that got caught up in all of this."

1322
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:52,464
<i>- [Lieber] I don't know if the city</i>

1323
01:28:52,464 --> 01:28:55,751
<i>The people who are lost,</i>
the families who experienced that.

1324
01:28:55,751 --> 01:29:03,773
<i>You can never put that back or replace,</i>
but there's a part of the city's self respect

1325
01:29:03,773 --> 01:29:05,613
<i>that I think is gonna be restored.</i>

1326
01:29:08,596 --> 01:29:11,266
<i>- [Childs] This is not Rome,</i>
in which you wanna hold it as it now is,

1327
01:29:11,266 --> 01:29:13,844
<i>as a great historic monument,</i>

1328
01:29:13,844 --> 01:29:15,392
<i>but something which evolves and changes.</i>

1329
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:17,224
<i> That's the nature of New York.</i>

1330
01:29:23,547 --> 01:29:27,172
<i>- [Philip] It's an incredibly healthy thing</i>
that the city responded

1331
01:29:27,172 --> 01:29:30,963
<i>to September 11th in sort of,</i>
classic New York fashion

1332
01:29:30,963 --> 01:29:35,190
<i>by beating each other up and</i>
grandstanding in political manipulation

1333
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:38,281
<i>and you can say, "Oh, that's awful."</i>

1334
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:42,118
<i>Or you can say, "What a wonderful thing</i>
that New York

1335
01:29:42,118 --> 01:29:44,910
<i>healed this big wound with more New York."</i>

1336
01:29:56,152 --> 01:29:59,140
Citing marketing concerns,
the Port Authority renamed

1337
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,929
the "Freedom Tower"
1 World Trade Center.

1338
01:30:02,083 --> 01:30:05,204
Soon after, the agency signed
a lease for 1 million square feet

1339
01:30:05,204 --> 01:30:08,756
of office space with magazine
publisher Condé Nast.

1340
01:30:09,387 --> 01:30:13,179
The building will be the tallest
in the city and is expected

1341
01:30:13,179 --> 01:30:16,121
to open in 2014, ten years after
the cornerstone ceremony.

1342
01:30:16,549 --> 01:30:20,334
Chris Ward was pushed out
of his job at the Port Authority

1343
01:30:20,334 --> 01:30:24,058
and replaced by a top aide
to Governor Andrew Cuomo.

1344
01:30:24,511 --> 01:30:29,715
7 World Trade Center reached
full occupancy in October 2011.

1345
01:30:30,869 --> 01:30:34,915
Larry Silverstein hopes to complete
the World Trade Center project

1346
01:30:34,915 --> 01:30:37,954
by 2016, when he'll be 85 years old.

1347
01:30:38,277 --> 01:30:41,929
4 WTC will be the first tower
to open on the site in 2013.

1348
01:30:42,514 --> 01:30:45,717
The completion dates for 2 and 3 WTC
depend on the success of

1349
01:30:45,717 --> 01:30:47,747
Silverstein's leasing efforts.

1350
01:30:47,939 --> 01:30:50,956
Since winning the master-plan 
competition in 2003, Daniel Libeskind

1351
01:30:50,956 --> 01:30:53,807
has designed more than 40 projects
around the world,

1352
01:30:53,807 --> 01:30:56,951
including several skyscrapers.

1353
01:30:57,330 --> 01:31:01,433
The cornerstone now rests
behind the headquarters of the

1354
01:31:01,433 --> 01:31:05,983
company that engraved it,
in Hauppauge, Long Island.
