<i>when you begin to see things more clearly.</i>

70
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:52,712
<i>When I found out I was pregnant</i>
with a girl, everything came into focus.

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,297
<i>But I looked around me</i>
and I was really frightened for her.

72
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,170
I couldn't imagine
that my daughter could grow up

73
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:06,881
to be emotionally healthy and fulfilled,
given our modern culture.

74
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:11,546
<i>So I'm compelled to make sense</i>
of all of this for her.

75
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:15,525
And I know I have to start 
by looking at my own life.

76
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:20,367
The mistakes I've made
and the traps I've fallen into.

77
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,027
<i>Because even though</i>
I've had many privileges,

78
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:29,468
<i>I haven't been immune to the damage</i>
our culture does to women and girls.

79
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,945
<i>When I was a young girl, I felt secure</i>
in my place in the world.

80
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:40,281
<i>But as with most girls,</i>
things changed as I got older.

81
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,486
<i>A few days before my 7th birthday,</i>

82
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:49,110
<i>my older sister, Stacy </i>
died in an accident.

83
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:55,594
I blame myself for her death.
And out of guilt and sadness,

84
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,606
I tried to be two daughters,
instead of one.

85
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:05,381
I channeled my pain into 
excelling in sports and school.

86
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,281
But no matter how hard I tried,
I somehow felt inadequate.

87
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:16,603
I became increasingly susceptible
to peer pressure.

88
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:18,651
And the bombardment 
of media messages,

89
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:23,075
telling me that being strong, smart,
and accomplished was not enough.

90
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:28,991
To be a woman meant constantly striving
for an unattainable ideal of beauty

91
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,932
and approval in the eyes of men.

92
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:36,289
So when a trusted peer 
and later a coach,

93
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,747
preyed upon my vulnerability
and violated me,

94
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,305
I was so frightened and ashamed.

95
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,616
I completely shut down.

96
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:50,214
My self worth was at an all-time low.
And I developed an eating disorder

97
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,903
that consumed two years of my life.

98
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,800
It took a lot of love and support for me
to find my strength again.

99
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:05,706
And although my experiences are unique,
my struggle is all too common.

100
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:11,009
<i>It's always hard being a teenage girl,</i>

<i>Is it any wonder teen girls feel</i>
more powerless than ever?

104

53% of 13 year old girls

Their number increases to 78%

106
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:36,603
65% of women and girls

107
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:42,138
17% of teens engage in cutting
and self-injurious behavior

108
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:45,235
Rates of depression among
girls and women have

109
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:48,850
doubled between 2000 and 2010

110

I want a different world for my daughter
and her generation.

111
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,135
But a lot has to change first.

112
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:03,526
- [Ariella] We see so much in the media
that there's so much negativity

towards women and their way
and how they look.

114
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:08,905
And it's just a representation 
of the pressure we feel

115
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:11,271
to conform to men's ideals.

116
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:16,450
There's this concept of the perfect woman 
who looks this certain way,

117
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:20,110
and because women may not look that way,
they're scrutinized.

Or like, "Go get a hamburger."

122
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:35,339
Because people thought 
I was like, anorexic or something.

123
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:39,210
So, I would like, eat a lot.

I don't have an eating disorder.

127
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,981
- [Alexis] I have close friends that

128
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:54,215
they would go to the bathroom

She cuts herself because

young men who are shown

about all of these images

158
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:27,869

until you're into your early twenties.

165
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:48,970
So, the idea that kids at eight or ten
or fifteen have the same level

166
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,078
of intellectual and emotional maturity

They have different

177
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,155
I had a lot of problems 
with the network

178
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:34,599
because they were constantly
telling me that I was too fat.

179
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,002
You know, I became
very anorexic trying to

somehow keep this job
that I really wanted to keep.

181

And you know, they ended up 
canceling the television show.

<i>Most media get their revenues</i>
from advertising, you know.

188
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:09,582
so, the non advertising content

feel anxious and feeling insecure.

194
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:26,728
For men, there's a lot of anxiety

198

because those are the body types

199

<i>and thus are a futiled pursuit </i>
of this idealized body.

201
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,962
It's a hugely profitable pursuit 
for these media industries

202
00:12:47,962 --> 00:12:49,351
and for all of the advertisers.

203
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:54,925
Advertisers spent 
$235.6 billion in 2009

204
00:12:55,262 --> 00:13:00,015
80% of the countries in the world

205
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:02,773
American women end up spending
much more money on beauty

<i>it's completely disempowering women.</i>

210
00:13:14,062 --> 00:13:17,482
US women spend $12,000
to $15,000 a year

211
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:20,116
on beauty products and salon services

212
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:24,068
The number of cosmetic surgical 
procedures performed on youth

213
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,413
under age 19 more than tripled
from 1997 to 2007

214
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:31,401
The average adult facelift 
costs $11,429

215
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:34,830
That's enough money to pay for:
5 years at a community college

216
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,769
2 years at a state university
1 year at the University of California

<i>The American Psychological Association</i>

220
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:50,611
<i>has found in recent years </i>
that self-objectification

221
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:53,972
<i>has become a national epidemic.</i>
A national problem.

222
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,194
- The more women and girls 
self-objectify,

223
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:02,714
the more likely they are to be 
depressed, to have eating disorders.

224
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:06,351
They have lower confidence.
They have lower ambition.

225
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,537
<i>They have lower</i>
cognitive functioning.

226
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:10,639
<i>They have lower GPAs.</i>

227
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:13,211
How does this connect 
to women and leadership?

228
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,757
Women who are high self-objectifiers
have lower political efficacy.

229
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:22,113
Political efficacy is the idea that 
your voice matters in politics

230
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:24,229
and that you can bring about 
change in politics.

231
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:28,463
<i>So, if we have a whole generation </i>

232
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:33,067
<i>where women's objectification is just part</i>
for the course, it's normal, it's okay,

233
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,793
we have a whole generation of women 
who are less likely to run for office

234
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,275
and less likely to vote.

<i>If the media sending girls the message</i>
that their value lies in their bodies,

feeling disempowered

238
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:57,007
<i>and distract them</i>
from making a difference

239
00:14:57,215 --> 00:14:58,554
<i>and becoming leaders.</i>

240
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:01,674
Women make up 
51% of the U.S. population

Yet comprise only 
17% of Congress

women have not made
gains in Congress since 1979

244
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:19,480
At this rate, women may not
achieve parity for 500 years

245
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,697
Only 34 women have
ever served as governors

the rest of the world a better balance.

249
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:42,457
67 countries in the world have had

The U.S. is not one of them

The U.S. is 88th in the world in terms
of women in national legislatures

00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:18,730
in every state and community
of this country.

296
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,735
The living wage campaigns,
Micro-Enterprise, safety,

297
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:25,011
everything that needed different thinking,
women have been doing it,

298
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:27,080
so we gotta get them
in the tables of power.

299
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,996
- [Condoleezza Rice] Well, two things 
have to happen when you talk about

300
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:33,572
women moving to the next rung
or minorities moving to the next rung.

301
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:35,882
First, we have to have the candidates.

302
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,128
You have to have people
who are in the pools

303
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,074
from which these positions are drawn.

304
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:43,161
But you also have to have a kind 
of psychological breakthrough

305
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,254
or can an American see a woman
born African-American in that position?

306
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,213
Now I think with women,
we still have a bit to go.

307
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:59,643
- [Jennifer] I knew these obstacles 
still existed from my generation,

308
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,473
<i>but I wanted to find out </i>
if things were any better

309
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:04,787
for young women
seeking leadership positions.

310
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:09,252
So I spent time with an exceptional 
young woman named, Devanshi Patel,

311
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,302
who aspires to have 
a career in public service.

312
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,634
- [Devanshi Patel]
"Well, welcome to Bill Hearing.

313
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:16,728
Tonight is the bill hearing night for

314
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:20,118
The Central Silicon Valley YMCA 
Youth and Government Delegation."

315
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:24,351
So, first time I ran for public office 
was in 4th grade.

316
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:27,344
My parents award with me.
We made all these flyers

317
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:31,133
with all these cute little slogans
and we campaigned all over the school,

318
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,220
and I was actually the runner-up 
by a handful of votes.

319
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,198
I think everyone is born with something

320
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:39,651
that they have to do 
and for me, this was it.

321
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:42,401
Every time that I could run for something,
I didn't run for anything less.

322
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:44,938
I didn't run for Vice President 
or Treasurer. I ran for President.

323
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,681
- <i>[Ranna Patel] I asked her one day. </i>
I think it was in 5th grade.

324
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:50,249
<i>I said, "Devanshi, you always want</i>
to be a leader,

325
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:52,243
<i>but do you know what a leader is?"</i>

326
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:55,401
She says, "It's very simple, Mama.
They are just servants to people.

327
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:58,933
Leaders are just servants to people."

328
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:02,219
- [Devanshi] I loved the Youth 
and Government program.

329
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:05,784
The best way I can give back
is by running for Youth Governor.

330
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,912
- [speaker] How would you solve 
the California Budget Crisis?

331
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,070
Starting with Ms. Patel.

332
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:12,034
- [Devanshi] I would cut 
unnecessary spending.

333
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,610
Well, when I was running for office, 
there were a lot of--

334
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,550
if not outward shows of sexism,
little remarks here and there, like

335
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:20,456
you know, "Oh, she speaks well 
for a woman.

336
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:22,329
She's smart for a woman."

337
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,988
There were also a couple instances
with some of my friends

338
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:28,007
<i>when they were going to speak </i>
in front of a large audience

339
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,847
<i>and the only thing people could</i>
focus on was their body,

340
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,208
<i>what they looked like,</i>
what they were wearing.

341
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,511
I thought, you know, 
"We're better than this."

342
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:41,983
Devanshi lost the election to one of 
her male opponents, coming in second.

343
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:48,561
- [Ranna Patel] She said,"Mama,
looks like I'm another Hilary Clinton."

344
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,028
- [Oliver Mittelstaedt] 
Guys will vote for guys.

345
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:51,882
And girls would vote for guys,
but some other time,

346
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:55,004
girls have a harder time getting
the girls do vote girls because

347
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,537
I feel like, girls are 
kinda harder on other girls.

348
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:00,777
65% of the 2000 teens who vote
in California's YMCA

349
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:04,915
Youth &amp; Government program are girls.

350
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,796
<i>- [Jennifer] Devanshi's story made me </i>
think about how early

351
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:11,131
<i>girls face a deep gender bias.</i>

352
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:14,642
<i>And how things have not changed</i>
as much as we'd like to think.

353
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,047
- [Gavin Newsom] One of the first things
I did when I became Mayor of San Francisco

354
00:21:19,063 --> 00:21:22,688
is I appointed a female police chief
and then a female fire chief.

355
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,230
When they both show up at the podium,
in a disaster, a lot of national media

356
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,494
would look there and say,
"Well, where is the police chief?"

357
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,946
"She's right here."

358
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,610
"And where's the fire chief?"
"Well, she's right here."

359
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,473
People thought I was trying 
to make some grand statement,

360
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:40,282
when in fact, I was actually just hiring 
the most qualified two candidates.

361
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:44,804
The incredible opposition
was coming mostly from women.

362
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:48,213
And those that feel it's much
too soon, too fast,

363
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:51,030
they never would've question 
at how they've been men.

364
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:53,405
- [Caroline Heldman]
Little boys and little girls

365
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:54,486
when they're seven years old,

366
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:57,148
an equal number want to be
President of the United States

367
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:58,966
when they grow up, about 30%.

368
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:02,226
<i>But then, you ask the same</i>
question when they're 15

369
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:04,156
<i>and you see this massive gap emerging.</i>

370
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:06,247
<i>So, we have this gendered socialization,</i>

371
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:08,348
<i>where politics is considered</i>
to be for men.

372
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:10,571
<i>Leadership is considered to be</i>
a masculine pursuit

373
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:15,109
and women are discouraged
from pursuing ambitious positions.

374
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:23,780
You can't be what you can't see.
-Marian Wright Edelman

375
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:26,900
- [Carol Jenkins] I think what happens is
that if you do not have women there,

376
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:30,721
then girls do not see
that they can be that.

377
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:35,841
So, it's really what you see 
that inspires your idea of

378
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:37,770
what's possible for you in the world.

379
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:40,331
- [Krystal Ball] "I do disagree
with Sarah Palin on a lot of issues,

380
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:43,514
but seeing her up on stage there
with her young family

381
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:46,135
and her young baby was just beautiful.

382
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:48,755
And I thought, 'You know what? 
Maybe I could give this a shot as well.'"

383
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:54,445
68% of viewers were more likely
to accept a female president

384
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:58,402
- [Marie Wilson] Having this opportunity 
to see women, to see women leadership,

385
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,352
to see women's leadership in reality
and on the screen

386
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:04,708
and on the television, 
is huge for women. Huge.

387
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:08,214
Because you don't have that 
many women really in leadership.

388
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:10,916
So the way that it gets done
to a certain extent

389
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:14,327
and way problems get solved 
often have to do with Hollywood.

390
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:17,738
And the films that get made. 
The documentaries, the television shows,

391
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:21,714
start where people are
and people are watching television.

392
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:26,398
- <i>[Jennifer] There are some examples</i>
of films and TV shows

393
00:23:26,398 --> 00:23:28,298
<i>that portray powerful women.</i>

394
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:32,617
<i>But in general, the situation</i>
in Hollywood is pretty bleak.

395
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:35,988
CANCELLED AFTER ONE SEASON

396
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:39,827
I decided to pursue acting
professionally at the age of 28.

397
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,721
And was hopeful I could find
complex roles to play.

398
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:46,939
My first reality check came when 
my agent told me to lie about my age

399
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:50,259
and remove my Stanford MBA 
from my resume

400
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,885
because it might be threatening.

401
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:54,426
Well, I didn't do either.

402
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:56,608
But my confidence was really shaken.

403
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:00,833
My second reality check came when
I learned that there were very few

404
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,530
multi-dimensional roles
to even audition for.

405
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:06,017
I shouldn't have been surprised.

406
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:07,965
<i>Because when you really look</i>
at Hollywood

407
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:09,838
<i>and the films that are being made,</i>

408
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:11,591
you see the same stereotypes

409
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:14,913

- [Ilian] Women are never the protagonist.
They're the ones who,

424
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,138
if they are the protagonist, 
it's something drama about

425
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:13,815
<i>getting a guy or something.</i>

426
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:16,427
It's never really about 
finding your destiny or whatever,

427
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:17,656
how they stayed for the guys.

428
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:21,024
<i>Like in the </i>Star Trek,<i> on this</i>
is your destiny and you know,

429
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:22,478
<i>being powerful,</i>
being the captain.

430
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:26,401
<i>But for girls, they wouldn't say that.</i>
And then, what's weird about it

431
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:30,135
is that it seemed normal for us,
like, we don't question it.

432
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:33,102
We don't say, "Oh, why isn't the girl 
being the protagonist for this?

433
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:34,506
Why can't a girl be powerful?"

434
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:39,617
Only 16% of protagonists
in films are female

435
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,275
- [Geena Davis] I hear this all the time.
Well, things are getting better.

436
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:46,339
I mean, things are getting better, 
you know. But, they're not.

437
00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:49,795
- [Caroline Heldman] Mainstream movies 
are genuinely stories of men's lives

438
00:25:49,891 --> 00:25:53,372
which revolve around men. 
And then we have this sub-genre

439
00:25:53,372 --> 00:25:55,831
<i>called, Chic Flicks, which are stories </i>
of women's lives,

440
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:59,471
<i>which when you look at them</i>

<i>They revolve around trying to get a man,</i>

443
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:06,986
<i>trying to get love, get married </i>
and get pregnant.

444
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:10,501
- "It's my fault that I'm

447
00:26:17,006 --> 00:26:20,365
- [Geena Davis] Between 1937 and 2005,

448
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:25,382
there were only 13 female protagonists
in animated movies.

449
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:30,482
All of them, except one,
had the aspiration of finding romance.

450
00:26:30,987 --> 00:26:33,713
- [Lisa Ling] As a culture, women are
brought up to just be kind of

451
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:36,630
fundamentally insecure 
and always looking for the time

452
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:42,795
when that knight on a horse will come
and rescue us or provide for us.

<i>- [Caroline Heldman] When it comes to</i>
female leaders in entertainment media,

454
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,986

455
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,771

<i>Hire the smart, fat girl."</i>

457
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:02,082
- The whole movie is about 
bringing her down a peg

458
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:05,385
and this is generally done by someone
who is under her, a subordinate,

459
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:08,876
typically a male, so that image 
doesn't bode well,

460
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:12,403
when it comes to ideas 
of women in leadership.

461
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:15,864
- <i>[Paul Haggis] We had many more</i>
interesting characters on screen

462
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:18,623
in the 20s, 30s, 40s
than we do now.

463
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:22,809
And we allowed women to really
embody all the conrtadictions

464
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,651
<i>that make up a human being</i>
back then.

465
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:27,273
<i>They could be the</i> femme fatale

<i>and then turn around </i>

467
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,723
<i>And then turn around </i>
and be the seductress.

468
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:36,242
And then turn and be the saint.
And we accepted that.

469
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:38,971
They were complex human beings.

470
00:27:38,982 --> 00:27:41,729
Now we really like to put people in boxes.

471

Witch and Sexy Kitten."

472
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,851
- "Oh, you just said 
a mouthful there, sister."

473
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:50,539
- <i>As men, we do it because</i>
we don't understand characters

474
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:53,397

willing to put ourselves

475
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:57,503
in the skin of those characters
and women, I think, terrify us.

476
00:27:58,091 --> 00:28:00,091
<i>We tend not to write women </i>
as human beings.

477

<i>It's cartoons we're making now.</i>

478
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,588
And that's a shame.

479

480
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,576

of women as sex objects.

481
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:16,014
<i>In rock videos, rapping, hip hop videos.</i>
in all the summer blockbusters,

482
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:20,368
women are basically just body props there
for young male viewers.

483
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:23,233
- [Joshua] I think when they 
do put in the part,

484
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:28,156
she's used as a sexual object or the
object of desire a lot toward the men,

485
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:29,642
which I think should change a lot

486
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:32,949
because there's still a lot more 
to women than just a body.

487
00:28:34,274 --> 00:28:37,005
- <i>[Jackson Katz] We're socializing boys</i>

That's learned behavior.

496

yet are 26% of women on TV

546

It's like when a female

she simply needs to go away.

that I had heard about others getting

549
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,772
and that was this. 
I had just gotten a series

550
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:03,267
and it was presented to me 
by my managers,

"Daphne, you're part is secure.

553
00:32:10,124 --> 00:32:11,873
Well, just like them,

"What do you mean Botox

00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:27,508
needles in my forehead, 
bleeding and I'm crying

"There's something wrong here."

less of a woman with integrity.

I felt like I was cheating and lying 
with this stuff in my face.

00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:52,310
So maybe I'll stop working. 
I don't know.

My very first movie,

that he wanted me to wear falsies

00:33:21,227 --> 00:33:25,715
and my director, Josh Logan, asked me
to have my back teeth pulled out.

You know, I wasn't good enough

Women exist to be stupid.

- "Or what?"

587
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,088
- "You motherfucking whore!"

588
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:21,475
- <i>This notion that women </i>
are natural enemies vying for

589
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:26,423
<i>the prize of being more beautiful</i>
than the rest or the love of whoever,

590
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,880
is so counter to women in real life.

591
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:34,228
- <i>"Please, pick me, pick me, pick me. </i>
See how beautiful I am."

592
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:37,523
<i>- [M. Gigi Durham] There's a really </i>
unequal power relationship going on there,

593
00:34:37,537 --> 00:34:39,822
<i>where it's the girls whose bodies </i>
are on display and the boys

594
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:41,437
<i>get the power to arbitrate and judge,</i>

595
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:43,723
whether their bodies
are acceptable or not acceptable,

596
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:45,289
<i>desirable or not desirable. </i>

597
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,760
So, I think there's 
a whole lot going on there

598
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,490
that actually puts girls in 
a really disempowered position.

599
00:34:50,903 --> 00:34:53,696
- <i>[Jennifer Pozner] These shows over</i>
the course of the last decade,

600
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:57,996
have tried to portray a world in which, 
the only options available to women

601
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:01,976
mimic the 1950s model of femininity, 
in which women's only power

602
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:05,189
was her beauty, in which women
not only had no choices,

603
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:09,041
<i>but shouldn't have even wanted any, </i>
in which men wore burdens

604
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,471
<i>with the responsibility of being</i>
the prince charming,

605
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:15,014
<i>who comes in and whisks women away </i>
to happily ever after.

606
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:17,508
<i>Then has to provide for their </i>
financial security.

607
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:23,055
Nobody wins in this model, but
women particularly, lose in this model,

608
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:26,242
where they're expected to look
like Miss USA, have sex

609
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:29,029
like Samantha on <i>Sex and the City</i>
and think like June Cleaver.

610
00:35:34,242 --> 00:35:37,400
- <i>[Jennifer] And here's something I find </i>
even more disheartening.

611
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,348
<i>Watching the news.</i>

612
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:43,720
<i>So many female journalists</i>
are objectified or sexualized.

613
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:51,505
- <i>♪ [CBS theme music ] ♪ This is the CBS</i>
Evening News with Katie Couric.

614
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,755
- "Hi, everyone. I'm very happy
to be with you tonight."

615
00:35:57,067 --> 00:36:00,415
<i>- [Carol Jenkins] Katie Couric was </i>
the very first national experience

616
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:04,858
we had all together viewing.
The woman who was not entertaining us,

617
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:07,064
<i>but whose presence and presentation</i>

618
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,655
<i>was vital for anything information </i>
that we needed.

619
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:12,495
- [Katie Couric] The three major
evening newscasts had been

620
00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:14,517
dominated by white males.

621
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:16,982
<i>They had very similar faces </i>

622
00:36:16,982 --> 00:36:19,871
<i>and very similar backgrounds</i>
for the most part.

623
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:23,170
I thought this is an opportunity 
to mix it up a little bit.

624
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,543
I also thought it was an important message
that a woman could be as confident

625
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:30,650
as a man in an important powerful role.

626
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,071
- [Carol Jenkins] And I remember 
in the early days,

627
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:34,133
when I would get calls 
from reporters about,

628
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:35,752
"Ah! That we have our
first woman anchor.

629
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:37,093
What do you think about that?"

630
00:36:38,261 --> 00:36:40,874
Inevitably, the questions 
that they would ask first, were,

631
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:42,130
<i>"What about those legs?"</i>

632
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,079
<i>"Do you think she was </i>
showing too much leg?", or

633
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:47,343
"What about that winter white, 
wasn't that a big mistake?"

634
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:50,911
<i>They were all observations</i>
that had to do with her physicality

635
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:52,892
and not really about the content at all.

636
00:36:52,892 --> 00:36:55,388
But again it's because 
as I've always said,

637
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:57,779
"We are a nation of teenage boys."

638
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:01,051
We don't know, you know, 
what to make of this woman

639
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:04,572
sitting in front of us and so you know,
we look at her legs, her boobs,

640
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:08,368
her hair, her whatever, you know.
Then maybe way down the line,

641
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,776
we'll get to listen to what she's saying.

642
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:13,732
- [Rachel Maddow] Ever since
I've been in media at all,

643
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,385
even since, you know, 
the first morning show that I was on

644
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:20,124
in Holyoke, Massachusetts, you know,
I was this sidekick newsgirl.

645
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:24,263
There's been like 
a really consistent proportion of--

646
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:28,005
I don't even know if I call it criticism.
Essentially, it's hate mail.

647
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:31,771
As I've become sort of better known
and I get more feedback,

648
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,953
the amount of 
"I hate you, homophobic.

649
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:39,237
I hate what you look like.
I'm gonna kill you."

650
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,569
Like threatening mail stuff, 
it's like the proportions

651
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:44,896
has stayed exactly the same.

652
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:50,038
It's always 14% of the feedback
and it's almost all of the hate mail

653
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,704
is about gender and sexuality.
I mean, who has the time

654
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:57,397
if that's really what you think
and you really are that bad a speller,

655
00:37:57,397 --> 00:38:00,371
like you really, you're still gonna 
take this time to let me know

656
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:04,450
what you 'thunk' about--
[laughs] about what I look like?

657
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:10,716
- [Lisa Ling] It's the scrutinization 
that women get

658
00:38:11,344 --> 00:38:15,149
that far surpasses 
the scrutinization that men get.

659
00:38:15,313 --> 00:38:20,416
I don't ever see gossip columns 
or tabloids reporting

660
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,914
on Brian Williams' personal life, 
yet Katie Couric

661
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:30,405
and what she is wearing
or who she's dating is headline news.

662
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:33,841
- [Katie Couric] I think whenever there
are two women who are working

663
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:39,496
in similar professions, it's
automatically positioned as a cat fight.

664
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:43,024
Diane Sawyer and I were pitted
against each other as if, you know,

665
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:46,216
we were gonna be in a mud wrestling
competition on the weekends.

666
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:50,579
And you never saw that with say, 
Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings.

667
00:38:51,017 --> 00:38:53,374
- "Take it away with the red hot boys
in blue, which--"

668
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,611
- "I got this one down."

669
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:55,424
- "Okay, good."

670
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:57,749
- Sometimes I look on 
the cable news channels.

671
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:02,880
I see women wearing very low cut shirts
and lots of makeup

672
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:06,972
and you know, their hair is kind of
tussled and they look like

673
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:10,652
they're working as cocktail waitresses,
instead of newscasters.

674
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:14,043
It's just a very mixed message.

675
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:15,623
- [Jay Leno] "Folks, we're gonna 
play a game.

676
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,153
I'm gonna show you
a photo of a woman.

677
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:18,348
You have to guess,
whether she is

678
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:21,690
a professional newscaster
or a Hooters waitress.

679
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,098
Are you ready? Here we go."
[audience laugh]

680
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,621
- [Jennifer Pozner] The local news 
anchorships look like,

681
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:29,004
you know, somebody's grandfather
and his second wife.

682
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,914
- [Katie Couric] Television's a 
very visual medium, obviously,

683
00:39:32,914 --> 00:39:35,803
and it's kind of how do you 
walk the fine line

684
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:40,754
of looking pleasing and attractive,
but also looking professional.

685
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:43,928
I look back on my <i>Today's Show</i>
interviews then I think,

686
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,269
"Geez, my skirt is way too short."

687
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:50,432
I sometimes worry that I started 
this thing with my legs and everything

688
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,031
that I have sort of started this trend
of trying to look, you know...

689
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,233
I don't know.

690
00:39:58,627 --> 00:40:02,732
- [Lisa Ling] There is so much pressure
to look a certain way.

691
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:08,233
When I'm on television, I never try 
and explicitly dress sexy.

692
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,398
I don't want to distract from 
the stories that I'm telling.

693
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:13,262
- [Rachel Maddow] I want you 
to focus on what I'm saying.

694
00:40:13,262 --> 00:40:15,308
There's a lot of words in my show
and I work really hard

695
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:17,711
on getting them in the right order.
[laughs]

696
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:19,295
For some people, I will always be

697
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:22,153
too hideous a creature
to be on television. That's fine.

698
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,393
But if you can get over that on day one,
it's gonna stay the same

699
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:27,023
for the whole time that I'm on the air.

700
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:29,532
- [Katie Couric] I think it's really hard 
for women today.

701
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,133
- <i>[Jennifer] The emphasis on </i>
women's appearance affects

702
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,367
<i>more than just women on screen.</i>

703
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:42,363
<i>It's affecting women's ability</i>
to participate in the political process.

704
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:49,236
<i>Ironically, the more power women gain,</i>
the stronger the backlash against them.

705
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:51,933
- <i>And this phenomenon is most evident </i>

706
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:55,415
<i>in the way the media disrespects </i>
our female leaders.

707
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:59,373
- "She's irresistibly cute. 
Let's put it that way.

708
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,720
In the way she presents herself, 
obviously, she's attractive and all that."

709
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,747
- "Sarah Palin looks 
really hot in that hat.

710
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:10,154
She's just sad that she
doesn't know how cars work.

711
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:12,809
Aww, that's crazy.
Have you seen the hat on her?"

712
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:16,856
- "Both you and Sarah Palin 
are good looking women.

713
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,030
I mean, you're attractive, young,
relatively young women.

714
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,432
-"Kagan is gonna put on the
US Supreme Court

715
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,374
as there's such a thing about
the aesthetics of the appointee.

716
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:26,948
Let's put that here that so 
she's not your type of face

717
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:28,614
you'd wanna see 
on the five dollar bill."

718
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:31,603
- "I think I'm gonna send
Sotomayor and her club

a bunch of vacuum cleaners

720
00:41:33,218 --> 00:41:35,172
to help them clean up
after their meetings."

721
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:38,757
- "Cynthia McKinney, the former 
congresswoman from Georgia

722
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:40,643
was another angry black woman."

723
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:42,988
- "Look at these ugly skanks who make up

724
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:46,288
the big female leadership 
of the democratic party."

725
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:48,690
- "You know that ugly hag,
Madeleine Albright, remember her?

726
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:52,138
A psycho. She was the Secretary 
of State under Clinton, remember?

727
00:41:52,138 --> 00:41:53,627
Like a fat moron."

728
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:57,592
- "And now we have the wicked witch
of the west, you know, that Nancy Pelosi."

729
00:41:57,628 --> 00:42:00,811
- "I think if speaker Pelosi were still 
incapable of human facial expression,

730
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:02,472
we'd see she'd be embarrassed."

731
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,345
- "Nancy Pelosi, that--
Get another face lift, lady.

732
00:42:05,345 --> 00:42:08,054
Another reason why it's very rare.

733
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,549
The final woman worthy
of serving in political off--"

734
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:14,430
<i>♪ Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead ♪</i>
- "And it's bye bye, Pelosi."

735
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:17,832
- "And Hilary Rodham Clinton,
her thighness, is no better

736
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:19,465
than Dumbo with the big ears."

737
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:22,794
- "When she raises her voice
and when a lot of women do, you know,

738
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:26,678
it's as I say, it reaches a point where--
- "Yeah, well, look, you know what?"

739
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:29,159
--with every husband in America
has heard it one time or another."

740
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,278
- "You get a woman in the oval office, 
the most powerful person in the world,

741
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:34,590
what's the downside?"

742
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,180
- "You mean, besides the PMS 
and the mood swings."

743
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:42,261
- [Pat Mitchell] There's probably 
no more powerful influence

744
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:45,920
in the way we view power than 
the way media treats power.

745
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:50,114
And media treats power 
as defined by men,

746
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:53,737
because it has been
throughout our generation

747
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,339
and the ones before 
generally define that way.

748
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:59,097
- [Erika Falk] When press representations 
of women who are, you know,

749
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:01,957
running for the highest office 
in the land are focusing, for example,

750
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:06,464
on how women look, 
instead of what they've done

751
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:10,222
or their issue positions. 
That's got to impact the audience

752
00:43:10,222 --> 00:43:12,797
in terms of how they evaluate 
and judge those women.

753
00:43:12,986 --> 00:43:15,293
One of the things it does 
is it trivializes them.

754
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:17,697
It makes women seem less powerful.

755
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:20,798
- [Jennifer Pozner] During the
Democratic National Convention in '84,

756
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:22,907
when Geraldine Ferraro was running,

757
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:25,367
she was introduced on
national television as,

758
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:29,155
"The first female vice presidential
candidate. Size six!"

759
00:43:30,437 --> 00:43:32,360
So this is not new.

760
00:43:32,754 --> 00:43:35,631
- [Debbie Walsh] My colleague did a study 
looking at Elizabeth Dole

761
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:39,275
and her race for President,
she was coming in second in Iowa

762
00:43:39,275 --> 00:43:43,655
at the time after George Bush 
and there was much more coverage

763
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:48,918
of her appearance than there was of the 
substance of what she was talking about.

764
00:43:49,996 --> 00:43:52,223
- [Jennifer Lawless] When I ran for
Congress, I was campaigning

765
00:43:52,223 --> 00:43:56,781
at grocery stores and a woman came up 
to me and she put her arms around me

766
00:43:56,817 --> 00:43:59,959
and she whispered, "Don't worry, 
you don't look nearly as fat in real life

767
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:03,335
as you do on TV." 
The week before the election,

768
00:44:03,335 --> 00:44:06,018
a man came up to me and he said, 
"You know, you seem great,

769
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,820
but I don't feel like
I could vote for you for Congress.

770
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,702
I feel like I should hire you
as a babysitter."

771
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:13,602
- [Nancy Pelosi] When I first ran for
public office, which is now

772
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:17,653
over 20 years ago, although my 
youngest was a senior in high school,

773
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:19,666
the question I was most 
frequently asked was,

774
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:21,782
"Who's gonna be taking care 
of your children?"

775
00:44:21,983 --> 00:44:24,021
And of course it's one of
those questions that

776
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:27,654
I don't think a man has ever been asked
when he has run for office.

777
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:29,474
- [Erika Falk] If you look at
the women who ran,

778
00:44:29,474 --> 00:44:32,325
who had honorary titles like, 
Senator Clinton,

779
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,475
if the press drops that title and 
instead refers to them as Mrs. Clinton,

780
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:40,380
this is a way to kind of diminish 
some of her accomplishments.

781
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,679
In John Boehner's first four weeks 
as Speaker of the House

782
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,715
he was on the cover of five 
national weekly magazines.

783
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:50,637
In Nancy Pelosi's four years
as Speaker of the House

784
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:52,377
she was on the cover of zero
national weekly magazines.

785
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:55,122
- [Dianne Feinstein] There is such a thing
as a media bias.

786
00:44:55,122 --> 00:45:00,130
For example, media will write in the
same way about a man and a woman.

787
00:45:01,185 --> 00:45:04,323
Senator X is a woman, 
complained that--

788
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:09,090
and in the same thing, 
Senator Y, stated that--

789
00:45:09,651 --> 00:45:11,600
So the man will get the <i>stated</i>

790
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,545
and the woman will get
the negative verb, <i>complained.</i>

791
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:20,431
- [Erika Falk] Women were twice as likely 
to be described emotionally as were men.

792
00:45:20,627 --> 00:45:26,206
And by painting women as more emotional
than men, we perpetuate this stereotype

793
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:28,415
that women are emotional. 
Therefore, they're irrational.

794
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:30,244
Therefore they can't handle a crisis.

795
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:32,501
Therefore, they should not be
in leadership positions.

796
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,245
- [Condoleezza Rice] I remember 
so many times during the campaign,

797
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:39,467
people asking, "Will she tough enough
to be Commander-in-Chief?"

798
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:42,677
Well, I've know plenty of men who aren't 
tough enough to be Commander-in-Chief

799
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:44,880
and nobody asked that question.

800
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,237
- "Making sure that these kids 
have a shot at the American dream...

801
00:45:50,237 --> 00:45:54,714
[sobbing]
...my God, it's important."

802
00:45:54,936 --> 00:45:57,639
- "Gosh. What do you think 
they would have done to Nancy Pelosi

803
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:01,353
if she hadn't gotten all worked up?
They would've said she's unstable,

804
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,557
couldn't do the job. 
Ooh, yes. Welcome to America."

805
00:46:08,668 --> 00:46:12,357
- [Pat Mitchell] A woman in power 
is often seen as a negative thing.

806
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:17,892
We associate all the worst aspects 
of power and we translate those

807
00:46:17,953 --> 00:46:21,164
to a woman seeking to achieve power.

808
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:23,266
- [Caroline Heldman] One of the key ways

809
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:28,317
in which media played a role 
in the primary, was to talk about

810
00:46:28,317 --> 00:46:31,578
Hillary Clinton's ambition 
as though it were a bad thing.

811
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:37,031
- "When Barack Obama speaks, 
men hear, 'Take off for the future'.

812
00:46:37,434 --> 00:46:41,650
And when Hillary Clinton speaks,
men hear, 'Take out the garbage.'"

813
00:46:41,853 --> 00:46:45,289
- "When she reacts the way she reacts
to Obama with just a look,

814
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:46,677
the look toward him, 
looking like,

815
00:46:46,677 --> 00:46:49,956
everyone's first wife standing 
outside a probate court."

816
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:51,561
- <i>"I don't know what they're </i>
getting at here, Tuck.

817
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:52,870
<i>But what do you think are</i>
they saying about Hillary?"

818
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:57,227
- "I don't know, but that is so perfect, 
a guy would have often said." [both laugh]

819
00:46:57,227 --> 00:47:00,839
"When she comes on television,
I involuntarily cross my legs."

820
00:47:00,893 --> 00:47:02,122
- "I know you do."

821
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:06,551
- Hillary Clinton had hecklers
following her saying, "Iron my shirt."

822
00:47:06,714 --> 00:47:09,215
- "And some people think
- [Hecklers shouting] <i>"Iron my shirt!"</i>

823
00:47:09,215 --> 00:47:13,258
- we bring about saying, I--"
- <i>"Iron my shirt! Iron my shirt!"</i>

824
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:16,615
- She was frequently called 
a bitch in mainstream media.

825
00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:20,324
- "She's a stereotypical bitch,
you know what I mean?"

826
00:47:20,472 --> 00:47:24,066
- "Obama did great in February that was
because it was black history month.

827
00:47:24,164 --> 00:47:27,581
And now Hillary is doing much better
because it's white bitch month, right?"

828
00:47:28,418 --> 00:47:31,886
- "If she knew how it made her look,
so alternately sappy and bitchy,

829
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:34,584
she'd stop it, but she can't
help herself, can she?"

830
00:47:34,671 --> 00:47:36,777
- Her credentials were 
constantly questioned.

831
00:47:36,777 --> 00:47:40,187
- "Let's not forget and I'll be brutal.
The reason she's a US Senator,

832
00:47:40,187 --> 00:47:43,320
the reason she's a candidate
for President, the reason she may be

833
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,006
a front runner, is her husband
messed around." -"Yeah, but--"

834
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:47,956
"That's how she got to be Senator 
for New York. We keep forgetting it.

835
00:47:47,956 --> 00:47:49,409
She didn't win there on her merit."

836
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:55,047
<i>- [Carololine] Sarah Palin presented </i>
a very different image.

837
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:59,271
She is the first national high profiled
female candidate

838
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:04,659
who presented herself in very
feminine terms as a "real woman."

839
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:07,070
- "She's the American dream. 
Women want to be her.

840
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:10,301
Men want to mate with her.
I wanna lay her next to me in bed."

841
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:15,652
- There were pictures shot 
between her legs of folks

842
00:48:15,652 --> 00:48:17,678
at the Republican National Convention.

843
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,738
In a nutshell, she was
<i>pornified</i> and <i>ditzified</i>

844
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:25,368
"I don't wanna say she's a ditz,
but last night,

845
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:28,057
my stripper's fake name 
was Sarah Palin." <i>[crowd laughs]</i>

846
00:48:28,444 --> 00:48:31,445
- "Yo, let me tell you somethin' 
'bout Sarah Palin, man, [all laugh]

847
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:35,098
she's good masturbation material."
- [Together] Oh! [all laugh]

848
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,825
- So, Hillary Clinton tried to be 
properly masculine

849
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:40,463
and properly feminine and she lost.

850
00:48:40,672 --> 00:48:45,203
Sarah Palin puts out this different image 
of, shall we say hyper femininity,

851
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:48,438
and she gets beaten up in
really degrading gendered ways.

852
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:54,994
- "But tonight we are crossing party lines
to address the now very ugly role

853
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:58,044
that sexism is playing in the campaign."

854
00:48:58,255 --> 00:49:03,090
- "An issue which I am frankly, surprised 
to hear, people suddenly care about."

855
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,542
<i>[crowd laughs]</i>

856
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,214

that diminish us, like pretty, 
attractive, beautiful--"

858
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:17,823

<i>[crowd laughs and applauds]</i>

860
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:27,079
- [Cory Booker] My worry is now that 
there are millions of people watching

861
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,711
Sarah Palin, Hillary Clinton... 
I could talk to about a lot of women

862
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:33,121
there in New Jersey politics.
There are millions of young women

863
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:36,091
watching this and the messages 
that they're getting are just not

864
00:49:36,091 --> 00:49:40,187
conducive to encouraging them
to put up with this kind of abuse.

865
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:44,034
- [Gavin Newsom] When you're not
treated the same, you are dehumanized.

866
00:49:44,078 --> 00:49:47,270
When you're not given the same
opportunity, you're dehumanized.

867
00:49:47,354 --> 00:49:50,472
When people look at you differently 
because you happen to be a woman

868
00:49:50,472 --> 00:49:55,955
and you happen to be in a position 
of some influence that someone who is a man,

869
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:59,631
would naturally be in based
on tradition or history

870
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:03,337
and people question your qualifications, 
that's dehumanizing.

871
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:09,370
- [Thomas] Empowered women in general,
threaten men because they feel

00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,721
that an empowered woman 
is just putting down a man

873
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:16,634
as opposed to trying 
to sort of raise herself.

874
00:50:16,997 --> 00:50:20,187
- [Jackson Katz] As women have been 
challenging men's power, in business,

875
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:22,338
in the professions, in education,

876
00:50:22,338 --> 00:50:26,463
and in politics and other areas
of social life,

877
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,266
the images of women that have
been flooding their culture,

878
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:33,187
have been showing women 
as taking up less space.

879
00:50:33,187 --> 00:50:36,021
They're less threatening.
They're highly sexualized.

880
00:50:36,218 --> 00:50:39,704
And therefore, a certain kind of power
has been taken away from them,

881
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,632
which is a power of being
a whole person.

882
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,844
And I don't think those things
are coincidental. I think that the way

883
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:51,005
that the symbolic realm has been acting 
as to take power away from women,

884
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:54,296
while women have been challenging
men's power in the concrete realm.

885
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:00,542
- <i>[Jennifer] It seems we become numb</i>
to the insidious ways

886
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:04,045
<i>the media holds women back </i>
when it misrepresents them.

887
00:51:06,332 --> 00:51:10,167
<i>I can't help but wonder, who are </i>
the people behind the scenes

888
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,089
<i>making these crucial decisions </i>
about what we see?

889
00:51:14,346 --> 00:51:18,225
<i>And what are the consequences </i>
for my daughter and her generation?

890
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,539
- [Barbara J. Berg] The media
has always been,

891
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,917
overwhelmingly,
in the hands of men.

892
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:53,430
Women own only 5.8% of all television
stattions and 6% radio stations.

893
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:57,225
- [Jennifer Pozner] As you go up the ranks
in media, fewer and fewer women

894
00:51:57,225 --> 00:52:00,413
and people of color exist
at every rung of the ladder.

895
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:02,253
Women hold only 3% of clout positions
in telecommunications, entertainment,

896
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:04,272
publishing and advertising.

897
00:52:04,272 --> 00:52:07,623
- [Carol Jenkins] That means that 97% 
of everything you know about yourself

898
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:10,688
and about your country and your world,
comes from the male perspective.

899
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:13,547
It doesn't mean that it's wrong,
it just means that in a democracy,

900
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,877
where you talk about equality 
and full participation,

901
00:52:16,877 --> 00:52:19,036
you've got half of the population,

902
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:21,296
more than half of the population,
not participating.

903
00:52:21,537 --> 00:52:26,119
- [Pat Mitchell] Many years ago, I said, 
"Why don't we just create our own network,

904
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:31,551
other than continuing to try and get our
stories told by other people's networks?"

905
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:36,042
So, we put together an idea.
We went to various distributors,

906
00:52:36,042 --> 00:52:39,272
including the broadcast networks, 
the cable companies, etcetera,

907
00:52:39,272 --> 00:52:42,814
pitched the idea 
and one person said to me,

908
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:44,832
"Well, why do we need
another women's network?

909
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:47,676
We already have one.
We have lifetime."

910
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:54,307
Meanwhile, there are 
22 ESPN sports channels

911
00:52:54,662 --> 00:52:58,079
- [Martha Lauzen] There's a fairly 
pervasive sense of denial

912
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,728
about the status of women working 
in both television and film.

913
00:53:03,371 --> 00:53:07,507
Peter Bart wrote a column in <i>Variety</i>,
talking about the glass ceiling

914
00:53:07,547 --> 00:53:09,887
and how it no longer exists.

915
00:53:09,964 --> 00:53:13,759
<i>Putting that kind of information </i>
out there is really troublesome.

916
00:53:14,195 --> 00:53:16,593
Women comprise only 16% 
of all writers, directors, producers,

917
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:20,089
cinematographers and editors.

918
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:24,840
And only 7 % of directors and 
10% of writers in film are women.

919
00:53:25,138 --> 00:53:27,420
- [Lisa Ling] For so long it has been
an industry dominated

920
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,198
by men who just don't leave.

921
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,671
- [Lindy DeKoven] People who employ 
other people tend to hire people

922
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:36,553
who are a reflection of themselves.

923
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,178
- [Barbara J. Berg] This impacts hiring. 
It impacts the news, directors,

924
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:43,103
the journalists, the people who are 
gonna cover the news,

925
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:45,087
and of course, who reports the news?

926
00:53:45,261 --> 00:53:49,785
Very much is the factor
in what kind of news is reported.

927
00:53:50,373 --> 00:53:55,046
The average number of news stories 
about women and girls is less than 20%

928
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:59,931
- [Martha Lauzen] When any group
is not featured in the media,

929
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:04,552
they have to wonder, "Well,
what part do I play in this culture?"

930
00:54:04,593 --> 00:54:07,232
There's actually an 
academic term for that.

931
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:09,678
It's called, symbolic annihilation.

932
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:16,528
[nuclear explosion]

933
00:54:26,357 --> 00:54:31,222
- [Geena Davis] All of Hollywood 
is run on one assumption

934
00:54:31,222 --> 00:54:36,391
that women will watch stories about men,
but men won't watch stories about women.

935
00:54:37,082 --> 00:54:45,506
And all the decisions are made 
based on this concrete fact

936
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:49,307
and nobody's ever really proved
that that's true.

937
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:52,476
I think it's a horrible indictment 
of our society, if we assume

938
00:54:52,476 --> 00:54:57,394
that one half of the population
is just not interested in the other half.

939
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,796
- [Catherine Hardwicke] The first couple 
of scripts that I wrote, of course,

940
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:06,053
had a female, you know, as a lead
character and people will look,

941
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,845
"Well, there's hardly 
any bankable actresses."

942
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:12,786
So, they can't carry a film. 
So, it has to be super low budget

943
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:16,619
or we wouldn't bankroll it and no one's 
gonna show up in the theaters

944
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:22,401
and I finally wrote the lowest
budget movie I could ever write.

945
00:55:22,468 --> 00:55:25,757
I co-wrote <i>Thirteen</i> 
with a 13-year old girl

946
00:55:25,942 --> 00:55:28,723
<i>and it was about people </i>
of lower income.

947
00:55:28,723 --> 00:55:30,911
<i>They could wear my clothes.</i>
We could shoot in my house.

948
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:34,161
<i>We could use my car. </i>
We made the movie and it went on

949
00:55:34,161 --> 00:55:38,119
<i>to Sundance and it went on to win awards</i>
and get international distribution

950
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:41,598
<i>and I think it was the same</i> Twilight.
like, with

951
00:55:41,815 --> 00:55:46,765
<i>Two major studios turned it down. </i>
Finally, a new upstart company showed me

952
00:55:46,765 --> 00:55:50,968
<i>the project and it turned into </i>
obviously, a phenomenon making

953
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:55,036
<i>over half a billion dollars so far.</i>
So, it is proved the theory

954
00:55:55,036 --> 00:55:58,349
<i>that girls and women</i>
wouldn't go to see a movie,

955
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:02,355
but they did go see the movie in droves.
And over and over and over.

956
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:05,272
And bought the DVD 
and even bought pillowcases.

957
00:56:06,986 --> 00:56:10,577
But there is a flip side to that, 
which is kind of astonishing to me.

958
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:14,211
On the next two <i>Twilight,</i>
they've hired guys.

959
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:17,990
<i>They did not seek out a female director</i>
and on the same side,

960
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:22,964
I've gone after some jobs that I've been
told flat out to myself and my agent,

961
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:25,807
"Oh no, we think a guy
should direct this."

962
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:28,737
<i>And to me, I think,</i>
"Okay, can a man direct, you know,

963
00:56:28,737 --> 00:56:30,651
Sex and the City, Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants,

964
00:56:30,651 --> 00:56:34,536
<i>the </i>Miley Cyrus<i> movie?"</i>
Nobody ever questions that.

965
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:38,571
But I, a very successful female 
director, cannot direct a movie

966
00:56:38,571 --> 00:56:40,325
that should be done by a man.

967
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:42,102
- [Jennifer Todd] But nobody says,
"I'm not gonna hire a female director."

968
00:56:42,102 --> 00:56:46,181
On their list, there's just 25 names
and none of them are women.

969
00:56:46,181 --> 00:56:49,547
- [Paul Haggis] What happens is, 
these studio chiefs who--

970
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:53,564
or people like myself, you know,
writer, producers or directors,

971
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,506
we see the world in a certain way

972
00:56:57,557 --> 00:57:02,208
and we don't really challenge that often
and so we just replicate the world

973
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:08,315
that we grew up in without
really asking why we're doing it.

974
00:57:08,777 --> 00:57:11,341
- [Martha Lauzen] What is the first thing 
that they tell people when they're,

975
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:14,423
you know, in a screen writing class?
Create what you know.

976
00:57:14,602 --> 00:57:16,728
<i>When you have greater diversity </i>
behind the scenes,

977
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:20,224
not only do you get more
female characters on screen,

978
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,637
<i>but you get a different kind </i>
of female character.

979
00:57:22,834 --> 00:57:26,601
<i>You get a more powerful and </i>
multi dimensional female character.

980
00:57:26,786 --> 00:57:29,400
- "You should have seen the way 
those men looked at me."

981
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,107
"For them, they discovered,
I was fearless!"

982
00:57:33,351 --> 00:57:35,869
<i>- [Rosario Dawson] That's why it's </i>
extremely important for women

983
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,951
<i>to be writing their own stories.</i>
Truly crafting those stories,

984
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:42,147
writing them down, directing them, 
and giving them to people

985
00:57:42,147 --> 00:57:47,623
to really emotionally become impacted by 
because when my mom tells me a story

986
00:57:47,623 --> 00:57:48,733
or my grandmother tells me a story, 
I'm riveted.

987
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:50,859
[women laughing]

988
00:57:50,859 --> 00:57:54,512
- [Geena Davis] None of us had any idea
what the response was gonna be

989
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,985
to <i>Thelma and Louise.</i>
One time I was at a red light

990
00:57:57,493 --> 00:58:00,207
and I heard this honking
and I looked next to me, and it's

991
00:58:00,222 --> 00:58:03,466
a car full of women who are
popping out of all the windows

992
00:58:03,466 --> 00:58:06,849
and the sunroof and going, 
"Whoo-hoo!"

993
00:58:06,899 --> 00:58:10,080
[laughs] I'm like,
"Well this is certainly never been

994
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,178
a reaction to my any of my other movies."

995
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:18,956
Then the very next movie I made was
<i>A League of Their Own</i>, where I had

996
00:58:18,956 --> 00:58:23,299
13 or 15 year old girls coming up to me
with the same kind of reactions,

997
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,377
"Oh my God. You have no idea 
that movie changed my life.

998
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,638
I played sports 
because of that movie."

999
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:34,036
And it really struck me how few
opportunities we give women to have

1000
00:58:34,036 --> 00:58:36,362
that kind of experience 
watching a movie.

1001
00:58:36,685 --> 00:58:39,337
- [Katie Couric] The media can be
an instrument of change.

1002
00:58:40,673 --> 00:58:45,618
It can maintain the <i>status quo</i>
and reflect the views of the society.

1003
00:58:46,006 --> 00:58:51,095
Or it can hopefully awaken people 
and change minds.

1004
00:58:51,938 --> 00:58:55,239
I think it depends on
who's piloting the plane

1005
00:58:59,934 --> 00:59:02,428
- <i>[Jennifer] I don't want it undervalued,</i>
the tremendous progress

1006
00:59:02,428 --> 00:59:04,346
women have made in America.

1007
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:10,435
<i>But if we look closely at the way </i>
our history has been recorded,

1008
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:14,399
<i>we start to understand the crucial role </i>
media has played

1009
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:16,157
<i>in defining who we are.</i>

1010
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:20,469
<i>- [Barbara J. Berg] Patriarchy really </i>
is America's default setting,

1011
00:59:20,746 --> 00:59:24,736
<i>where men hold the positions</i>
of privilege and power.

1012
00:59:25,721 --> 00:59:29,208
And where women very often
are treated as second-class citizens.

1013
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,089
It's always been problematic
in American society

1014
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:34,590

that marketers have dictated
our cultural norms and values.

1168
01:07:45,577 --> 01:07:48,759
And this is made possible by 
the relaxation of rules on advertising

they felt that they had a very major 
public interest commitment.

It's actually enforced by the
Federal Communications Commission,

Period. End of story.

Today, it is the wild, wild west.
It is a free-for-all.

2004 The Centers for Disease Control

2007 The FCC unanimously recommends
Congress regulate TV violence

1230

2007 Congress holds special hearing

2009 Studies prove exposure to sexually
implicit video games and music videos

1233

but are largely in the pocket 
of the media industry.

1239

<i>Because their fortunes</i>
as politicians are dependent

<i>Media has not been held accountable </i>
by our elected representatives

01:11:34,343 --> 01:11:37,264
and it's not a liberal
or conservative issue,

1244
01:11:37,268 --> 01:11:39,886
it's an American issue 
and an American problem.

01:11:40,104 --> 01:11:41,785
- [Malkia Amala Cyril] 
Without a media sense,

1246
01:11:41,785 --> 01:11:43,368
when that's publicly accountable,

1247
01:11:43,368 --> 01:11:46,682
what you have is not only 
widespread content bias,

1248
01:11:46,994 --> 01:11:51,204
but what you have is a completely 
inaccessible public conversation.

- [Jim Steyer] For years, 
the media industry

1250
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:55,992
hid behind the label of censorship.

1251
01:11:56,194 --> 01:11:59,064
<i>It's not censorship to say</i>
to a media company

1252
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:02,842
that's producing an image or a website
that's really offensive

1253
01:12:02,842 --> 01:12:05,628
and really inappropriate. 
That's the essence of free speech.

1254
01:12:05,832 --> 01:12:10,163
But in a world of a million channels 
like we have today, people try to do

1255
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:12,926
more shocking and shocking things
to break through the clutter.

1256

<i>And often times, they resort </i>
to violent images

or sexually offensive images
or demeaning images,

1258
01:12:18,107 --> 01:12:19,942
'cause they know it'll get attention.

1259
01:12:20,138 --> 01:12:24,482

01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:28,563
it's not fair to put the burdens on the
shoulders of boys or even young men.

1301
01:15:28,563 --> 01:15:30,977
Even though, they're part of the solution,
there's no question.

1302
01:15:30,977 --> 01:15:32,715
This is about adult men.

- [Calvin] I definitely am not one 
to conform to the--

1304
01:15:36,428 --> 01:15:40,896
we need to be hyper masculine and 
we need to be misogynistic stereotypes.

1305
01:15:43,033 --> 01:15:48,287
It really puts a lot of pressure on me 
when I have relatives who have grown up

1306
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:53,299
with this phenomenon, who attempt 
to put me on that path,

1307
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:54,685
but I'm not ready for it.

1308
01:15:54,785 --> 01:15:57,787
- [Cory Booker] I remember sitting down
having this conversation with a woman

1309
01:15:57,787 --> 01:16:00,872
far wiser than me 
and stories to talk about,

1310
01:16:00,872 --> 01:16:05,003
"Oh, how bad it is for women in America,"
and she just looked at me

1311
01:16:05,003 --> 01:16:06,657
and listened to me 
for a while and she said,

1312
01:16:06,657 --> 01:16:07,692
"Well, I have to tell you, Cory,

1313
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:09,851
I actually think it's really bad 
for men in America."

1314
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:11,608
And I go, "What do you mean?" 
She started talking to me

1315
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:15,461
and really putting the spotlight on me
and talking about how emotionally

1316
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:17,459
constipated men are taught 
to be very early on,

1317
01:16:18,689 --> 01:16:23,494
how we don't have-- haven't learned 
how to express ourselves in healthy ways,

1318
01:16:23,494 --> 01:16:28,364
it often does manifest itself in such 
awful and violent ways.

1319
01:16:28,509 --> 01:16:32,452
But she talked about a spiritual healing
that was needed for guys.

1320
01:16:43,636 --> 01:16:45,320
- <i>[Jennifer] I've been trying to imagine</i>

1321
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,967
<i>a better world for my </i>
daughter's generation.

1322
01:16:49,078 --> 01:16:51,242
<i>And I'm beginning to get some ideas.</i>

1323
01:16:51,869 --> 01:16:53,843
"The numbers of women 
in leadership positions

1324
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:56,508
in our country are still very low."

1325
01:16:57,288 --> 01:16:59,963
<i>We have to find a way</i>
to change this culture.

1326
01:17:00,892 --> 01:17:03,560
We need to shift our focus
from the bottom line

1327
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:07,263
<i>to one of social responsibility. </i>
We need to challenge

1328
01:17:07,263 --> 01:17:09,691
<i>the media conglomerates</i>
to value women

1329
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,947
<i>for more than their youth, </i>
beauty and sexuality.

1330
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:15,889
<i>And we must hold</i>
these companies accountable.

1331
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:18,283
<i>We need to encourage women </i>

1332
01:17:18,283 --> 01:17:21,611
<i>to discover their true power,</i>
so they can become leaders.

1333
01:17:22,127 --> 01:17:23,872
<i>And we must support them </i>
on their journey.

1334
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:28,100
70% of women in the workforce 
are mothers

1335
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:32,357
yet we have no national paid family 
leave, childcare or flex time policy

1336
01:17:32,434 --> 01:17:37,307
<i>And ultimately, we need to live our </i>
own vision of what a woman can be.

1337
01:17:37,398 --> 01:17:40,904
Be the change you want 
to see in the world.

1339
01:17:44,324 --> 01:17:47,635
- [Condoleezza Rice] We make a mistake 
when we say, you have to find

1340
01:17:47,635 --> 01:17:49,635
role models who look like you.

1341
01:17:50,556 --> 01:17:55,403
If Sally Ride, my dear friend,
first female astronaut had been waiting

1342
01:17:55,403 --> 01:18:00,086
for a female astronaut role model,
she would never have done it.

1343
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:03,744
And so, I'm a big believer 
in finding your role models

1344
01:18:03,744 --> 01:18:05,481
wherever you can find them.

1345
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:08,801
In people who inspire and
stimulate you for whatever reason.

01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:10,872
- [Jan Yanehiro] Growing up,
there was nobody

1347
01:18:10,872 --> 01:18:12,509
who looked like me on television,

1348
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:15,503
so I never dreamed 
that I could be on television.

1349
01:18:15,644 --> 01:18:20,233
I would love to say, "Yeah, there were
some great women role models back then."

1350
01:18:20,233 --> 01:18:22,311
Actually, there were none.

1351
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:27,585
Years later, Connie Chung went on
television to report in Watergate,

1352
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,272
and I would say to her, 
"Connie, you're my role model."

1353
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:32,601
She would say to me,
"Jan, but I'm not that old."

1354
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,131
And I say, "Yeah, you're a year 
older than I am, Connie

1355
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:36,486
and that's good enough for me."

1356
01:18:36,777 --> 01:18:39,426
- [Katie Couric] In terms of my
role models in television news,

01:18:39,452 --> 01:18:41,812
of course, Barbara Walters,
Lesley Stahl,

1358

and believe it or not,
Mary Tyler Moore.

1359
01:18:44,482 --> 01:18:47,828
<i>I grew up watching that show </i>
and the notion of a woman

1360
01:18:47,828 --> 01:18:51,610
making it on her own
and working at that TV station,

1361
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:54,435
I think was, very, very influential.

1362
01:18:54,839 --> 01:18:56,134
- [Rachel Maddow] One of the things
that really surprised me

1363
01:18:56,134 --> 01:19:00,870
was the number of women
in positions of power in television

1364
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:02,335
who reached out to me and said,

1365
01:19:02,335 --> 01:19:04,717
"Can I take you out to breakfast?" 
"Can I take you out to lunch?"

1366
01:19:04,717 --> 01:19:07,067
"Can I make sure that you have 
my phone number or my email address,

1367
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:11,912
so that if anything comes up--" and
it definitely wasn't like a gender mafia

1368
01:19:11,912 --> 01:19:15,971
going on in the media, 
but there was an over effort

1369
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:20,797
to both welcome me and make me know
that women who had gone before me,

1370
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:23,674
who had fought to get where they were,
were both happy that I was there

1371
01:19:23,674 --> 01:19:25,460
and wanted to be resources to me.

1372
01:19:25,663 --> 01:19:28,322
And there's an expectation that 
I will be a resource to other women.

01:23:24,622 --> 01:23:27,857
for Montana that any parents
have for their child.

1443
01:23:28,594 --> 01:23:32,129
We want her to pursue her purpose 
and passions in life

1444
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:35,076
and to understand 
that what's really important

1445
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,711
is who she is on the inside.

1446
01:23:38,729 --> 01:23:41,679
And it's critical to us 
that all girls grow up in a world

1447
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,802
where their voice counts,

1448
01:23:43,933 --> 01:23:47,294
where our culture embraces them 
in all of their diversity

1449
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:50,786
and where they're afforded 
equal opportunities to succeed in life.

1450
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:55,773
I keep coming back to my early years.

1451
01:23:56,602 --> 01:24:00,907
Too often, we girls and women 
don't recognize our own internal strength.

1452
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:08,921
I now know that we can't let anyone
or anything take our power away from us.

1453
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,177
What do you think, Montana?

1454
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:18,111
Are you ready?

1455
01:24:20,953 --> 01:24:24,900
Join the Movement
www.missrepresentation.org

1456
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:27,747
- If we really want things 
to change around you,

1457
01:24:27,747 --> 01:24:29,655
here's what you can do.

1458

Text REPRESENT to
313131

1459
01:24:33,411 --> 01:24:36,160
- Measure yourself by accomplishments
and not by how you look.

1460
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,746
- If you and I, every time
we pass a mirror,

1461
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:42,270
downgrade on how we look,
or complain about our looks,

1462
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:46,759
if we remember that a girl is watching us,
and that's what she's learning.

1463
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,648
- Reflect on the ways you 
may contribute to sexism.

1464
01:24:49,848 --> 01:24:53,596
- I include myself in this. 
We scrutinize the women.

1465
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:56,223
"God, look how old she's gotten,
look how gray she's gotten.

1466
01:24:56,223 --> 01:24:57,482
What is she wearing?"

1467
01:24:57,695 --> 01:25:01,259
I think that as women, we need to stop 
that destructive behavior

1468
01:25:01,259 --> 01:25:05,389
that we inflict upon each other
and ultimately onto ourselves.

1469
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:08,529
- Support media that champions 
accomplished women.

1470
01:25:09,043 --> 01:25:13,530
- We need strong women role models who
in the media because they did something,

1471
01:25:13,687 --> 01:25:16,004
because they're doing great work, 
not because they have

1472
01:25:16,004 --> 01:25:20,142
the most bangin' body
and they're sexiest woman of 2010.

1473
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:22,027
They're the best philanthropists.

1474
01:25:22,064 --> 01:25:25,467
They're the best in the medical field
and it's not about the way they look,

1475
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:27,462
it's about who they are inside.

1476
01:25:28,521 --> 01:25:32,543
- Boycott magazines, TV shows and movies 
that objectify and degrade women.

1477
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:36,545
- Speaking your mind and criticizing
media companies when you think

1478
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:38,639
they're doing things that are 
inappropriate at your children,

1479
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,810
is not just your God-given right
as an American, as a parent,

1480
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:45,828
but it's also entirely consistent 
with the First Amendment.

1481
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,925
- Go see movies written 
and directed by women.

1482
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:53,883
- And it's important to go on opening 
weekend and Friday is best

1483
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:57,106
because these are the numbers 
that Hollywood tracks.

1484
01:25:57,526 --> 01:26:00,260
- Write your own stories 
and create your own media

1485
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:03,205
about powerful women
in non-traditional roles.

1486
01:26:03,568 --> 01:26:05,758
- My daughter, when she was nine, 
she wrote this little screenplay

1487
01:26:05,758 --> 01:26:07,995
and she shot a movie you know,
with our little video camera,

1488
01:26:07,995 --> 01:26:11,512
with her you know, casting her friends 
and it was just so much fun for her

1489
01:26:11,512 --> 01:26:14,674
and it teaches them that the media 
are a construction.

1490
01:26:14,827 --> 01:26:15,937
And they start to understand

1491
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,983
that these are stories that people
are telling them and they can come up

1492
01:26:17,983 --> 01:26:20,706
with their own stories to tell back
and very often, they can be you know,

1493
01:26:20,706 --> 01:26:22,732
subversive stories, resistant stories.

1494
01:26:23,007 --> 01:26:25,936
- Teach those around you 
to look at the media critically.

1495
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:31,128
- Well, one thing that I do with my kids, 
is I watch these shows with them,

1496
01:26:31,128 --> 01:26:35,104
I say, "Hey, did you notice 
there's only one female in that group?"

1497
01:26:35,172 --> 01:26:39,427
and, "What if that character 
had been a girl, instead?"

1498
01:26:39,503 --> 01:26:43,560
and, "Why is she wearing that when
she's trying to rescue somebody?"

1499
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:47,256
- Ask your school to start 
a media literacy course

1500
01:26:47,256 --> 01:26:49,074
focused on gender issues.

1501
01:26:49,429 --> 01:26:53,884
- We need media literacy as much I think, 
as we need to learn to read.

1502
01:26:54,023 --> 01:26:57,506
Our responses should be, "Whose 
perspectives are framing this story?"

1503
01:26:57,744 --> 01:27:00,630
"There are always more than 
two sides to every story."

1504
01:27:00,993 --> 01:27:03,012
"Are we being sold here?"

1505
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:05,110
- Don't be afraid
to challenge your friends

1506
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:08,031
if you hear them saying 
derogatory things about women.

1507
01:27:08,243 --> 01:27:12,638
- King said it very eloquently, "The
problem today is not the vitriolic words

1508
01:27:12,638 --> 01:27:14,542
and the evil actions
and the bad people,

1509
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:17,834
it's the appalling silencing 
and inaction of the good people."

1510
01:27:18,031 --> 01:27:21,052
- Find healthy role models
and be a mentor to others.

1511
01:27:21,744 --> 01:27:25,419
- Encourage women to become leaders
- and support them in the process.

1512
01:27:25,771 --> 01:27:29,799
- If we see women who we think
would be excellent at any political job,

1513
01:27:29,799 --> 01:27:32,872
whether it's dog catchers, 
school board member,

1514
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:36,845
or member of Congress, 
we need to make that known.

1515
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,812
- "Whatever women do, they must do 
twice as well as a man

1516
01:27:40,812 --> 01:27:43,507
to be thought of as half as good.

1517
01:27:43,699 --> 01:27:46,569
Luckily, that's not too difficult."

1518
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:51,102
Miss Representation 
would not be possible

1519
01:27:51,102 --> 01:27:53,514
if one woman had not
initially believed in another.

1520
01:27:53,806 --> 01:27:57,321
Thank you Regina for your trust
in me and our team.

1521
01:27:57,977 --> 01:28:02,962
May we all make empowering 
other women and girls a priority.
