[Gidon:] Many people ask me, what is the difference between

4
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:16,199
steam cleaning and dry cleaning methods.

5
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:22,050
Steam cleaning is basically extracting or washing your carpet

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,416
and extracting the dirt with a carpet cleaning machine back into a machine.

7
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:31,665
So, you're basically having...a process of wash,

8
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:36,998
they're getting down on your carpet where there is a detergent applied,

9
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:43,839
water applied, and then a suction appliedas well to extract the dirt out of your carpet.

10
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:48,319
With a dry cleaning system, all you do is spray detergent down

11
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:56,054
and go with an agitating machine with a pad to try and pick up as much dirt out of the carpet.

12
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:58,890
So, there is no extraction down the road.

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,345
It's basically just cleaning the toe part of the carpet

14
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:07,855
without going deep down into the bottom of the fibre.

15
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,672
The reason they created the dry cleaning system

16
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:17,298
is because steam cleaning used to take a lot longer to dry than the dry cleaning system.

17
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:23,395
A lot of people mistake the dry cleaning of carpets with dry cleaning of clothes,

18
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:25,624
but it's completely different methods.

19
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:31,962
Different detergents are getting used betweendry cleaning the carpet and dry cleaning clothes.

20
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:35,450
With dry cleaning clothes, you use solvents.

21
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:39,521
When you dry clean carpets, you use alkaline detergents,

22
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:44,720
you would use the dry cleaning process in the maintenance system

23
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:52,112
where you steam clean the carpet once ayear and then dry clean the carpet once a month.

24
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:56,638
I would only recommend using the dry cleaning system in a commercial job

25
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:59,000
and not in a residential job.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,276
We do use the steam cleaning methodbecause it is a better method to clean your carpets.
