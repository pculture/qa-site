﻿- [Cara Waters]<i>Good afternoon,<br/>everyone</i>

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>and welcome to Smart Company’s<br/>first webinar of the year</i>

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>which is “How to Deal With Customers<br/>Who Won’t Pay”</i>

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>I think you agree it’s a<br/>pretty important topic for all S.M.E.’s</i>

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>My name is Cara Waters,<br/>I’m the editor of Smart Company</i>

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>and today I’m joined with our--<br/>virtually</i>

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>because they're in a different<br/>place from me. </i>

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>But Andrew Baird, who is a Principal in Accounting and Business Advisory at WHK</i>

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>and Emily Jaksh, whose task is<br/>Head Guru at HR Gurus.</i>

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>So for the webinar, if you haven’t<br/>logged in to one of these before,</i>

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>just to let you know, the way to<br/>participate is firstly by listening.</i>

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>The audio will automatically be<br/>streamed through your computer speakers,</i>

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>and another way is by</i> Twitter.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>So you can use the</i> @SmartCompany<br/><i>or the</i> #smartcowebinar.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>Now the major way though if you want<br/>to get really interactive</i>

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>is to ask questions via the questions pane, which is,</i>

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>you’ll see on your computer screens.</i>

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>What you’ll do is you type in your questions</i>

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>in the space at the bottom and click on send.</i>

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>I’ll then be asking our two presentors<br/>Andrew and Emily all your queries.</i>

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>So I really encourage you to send<br/>them through because--</i>

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>it is an important topic and something<br/>that I’m sure a lot of you</i>

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>do have questions about.</i>

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>Also, I just want to thank our<br/>partners for today’s webinar, who--</i>

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>business victor –<br/>which is Business Victoria,</i>

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>providing big help for<br/>small business.</i>

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>And one final reminder before I hand over to Andrew and Emily is that,</i>

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>you don’t have to worry about<br/>furiously copying down notes</i>

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>because we will send you copy<br/>of the slides to the webinar</i>

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>and recording of the webinar<br/>as well.</i>

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>So you can relax a little bit, although<br/>you're free to take notes if you want to.</i>

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>So, I'll now hand over and let them<br/>introduce themselves properly<i></i></i>

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
<i>to Andrew and Emily. </i>

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
