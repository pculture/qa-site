- [Philip Nobel] Larry Silverstein
was vilified immediately

65
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,840
as the greedy developer,
because people in New York

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,231
don't know any other kind of developer.

67
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,150
- [Silverstein] It wouldn't surprise me,

68
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,881
if the replacement of the
Twin 110-storey towers

69
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:11,360
ultimately results in the
creation of four towers.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,314
Perhaps, 50, 55--
maybe 60 storeys in height.

71
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:19,285
- [Philip] The first thing he did was
he came out with a plan for the site.

72
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:25,479
A kind of a sketch plan for the site
that rebuilt all of the square footage

73
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,774
to the inch and then
threw in a little park.

74

And that was a week after the attack.
You know, too early.

75
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,798
Then, he told the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

that it would be a tragedy
for him not to rebuild.

it was awful. It was awful.

I mean, it was excruciating.

- [Philip] One of the things people forget
about the event and the re-development

83
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:24,850
is this little special period of time,
between the Tuesday of the attack

standing on this pile of God knows what,

in addition to all the other things

101

<i>No commercial office building </i>
that I know of,

106

<i>in the history of offices </i>

107

to also be a symbol of defiant renewal
or a symbol of vengeance,

108
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:07,112
or a symbol of healing, you know.
That's just not what skyscrapers do.

109

right behind us, right here,

This could be a place

a hundred and a thousand 
years from now.

116

<i>We have to be able to create something</i>

[crowd applauding]

119
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,658

his farewell address, he suggested

120
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:03,961
<i>that nothing should be rebuilt here,</i>
that it'd simply become a memorial.

121

<i>A large, serene memorial </i>

122

There was never any chance of that
happening. I think the Mayor knew it.

123
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:18,274
I think the proof that he knew it 
was to create the LMDC,

the Lower Manhattan Development
Corporation, in order to pass that

125

along to George Pataki, for fear that
a mayor, who was not a Republican,

was going to succeed Guiliani.

ALBANY

128

right after September 11th.

129
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:41,162
Mayor Guiliani and I sat down and said,
"We're gonna need massive assistance.

We're gonna have help from Washington.
We're gonna have insurance proceeds.

is central to what eventually happens

134
00:09:56,727 --> 00:10:00,361
in Lower Manhattan. Here's why.
Two agencies, the Lower Manhattan

135
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:03,188
Development Corporation and 
the Port Authority control the process

136
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:06,392
and New York's Governor 
controls half of each.

137
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,602
- [Philip] There's no single person 
involved with the re-development

138
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:13,590
who had his much sway 
on it as George Pataki.

139
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:18,443
<i>He achieved that position </i>
by creating the LMDC

140
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:25,821
and initially packing it with his cronies
and using it as almost like, control rods

141
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:29,788

At some point, he would slow it down,

142

at some point, he would speed it up,

143

several insurance companies claiming,

150
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,731
<i>the attack on Twin Towers</i>
was two separate events.

151
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,902
<i>The insurers say it was one.</i>

152
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,346
<i>Billions of dollars are at stake</i>
on the outcome.

153
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:10,610
- [Silverstein] First issue. One event,
two events. We needed, as it turns out,

154
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,318
we needed two events, 
because to rebuild the Trade Center,

155
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:15,318
the cost to rebuild the Trade Center

156
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:21,098
would require, not just $3.5 billion,
it would require closer to $7 billion.

157
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,810
Right? We needed more money.

158
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,400
<i>- [Roland Betts] I think</i>
he was preoccupied with this

159
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,521
<i>bizarre legal theory</i>
that there were two buildings,

160
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,408
<i>so therefore it was two separate incidents</i>
and therefore,he had to double his return.

161
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:37,536
Most of us in the LMDC thought just
logically, that would be a silly result.

162
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:40,640
You know, you have insurance policy
on two buildings for a set number.

163
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:44,712
I don't see mathematically, how you're
gonna end up with more than a set number.

164
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:48,948
<i>- [Janno Lieber] People argued about it</i>
a little bit, like it was common sense,

165
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,585
<i>but believe me, anyone who has read</i>
an insurance policy knows

166
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,343
<i>it's not a common sense industry,</i>
it's all about the specific language

167
00:11:55,343 --> 00:12:01,435
and what it means. And in fairness, that 
was essential to protect the possibility

168
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:03,343
of rebuilding, that somebody talked about,

169
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,344
"How are we gonna get 
the money to do this?"

170
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:11,710
The result was that Larry was a typecast,
I think, early on in the process,

171
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,303
as somebody who was fighting about money,
while people were worrying about

172
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:20,710
human loss and then about whether we
were gonna build something great.

173
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,379
And Larry was off fighting about money.

174
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,653
- [Silverstein] They did everything 
they possibly could to excoriate,

175
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:36,349
to criticize, to denigrate. 
It was just a constant flow.

176
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:40,249
Talk about, needing a thick skin 
for that, let me tell you,

177
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:43,136
I just had to get thick fast.

178
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:51,210
<i>Born in Brooklyn, it was not</i>
a very pretty part of Brooklyn.

179
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,968
<i>So, probably not one of the best,</i>
probably one of the worst.

180
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,212
I remember we lived at the top of a--
either a six or a seven story walk-up.

181
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:03,490
It had the best view, 
but you had to walk up.

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,857
It was not a very luxurious existence.

183
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:11,744
My parents, obviously, were struggling.
And then after that, I went to NYU.

184
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:16,602
And by this time, my father gravitated
into the real estate business.

185
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:19,470
He became a real estate broker. 
He read someplace that real estate

186
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,511
was a foundation of wealth,
so he decided to become a broker.

187
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,258
I said, "The guys who make the money
are the guys who own the buildings."

188
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:27,160
I said, "We could become an owner."

189
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,826
<i>I remember finding a building</i>
down on East 23rd street,

190
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:34,370
so I remember finding how much it was.

191
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,370
Six-hundred thousand
it was for the building.

192
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:41,283
Six-hundred thousand,
where do you get $600,000?

193
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,322
<i>So what we did, we went to the people</i>
my father had successfully leased

194
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:52,297
stores and lofts to. And then,
I had made the pitch.

195
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:57,760
They only joined us for a 
small investment in the building.

196
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:01,585
And one after one another,
finally said, "yes."

197
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:05,673
<i>And we bought buildings, bought larger buildings</i>
and we renovated buildings,

198
00:14:05,673 --> 00:14:09,820
<i>we altered them, we modernized them.</i>
And then, ultimately, it led to finally

199
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,545
being the foundation. Pour in the slab
and building the building.

200
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:19,155
<i>- [Lieber] 7 World Trade Center</i>
was developed in the early 1980s,

201
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:21,410
<i>because the Port Authority</i>
had a piece of land,

202
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,596
<i>just north of the World Trade Center site</i>
and they decided to develop it.

203
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:26,697
And Silverstein won the bid.

204
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:29,580
And so, all of a sudden, 
Silverstein was at a new level.

205
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:33,668
<i>- [Silverstein] I remember</i>
at the topping out ceremony of 7,

206
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,887
looking up at the Twin Towers,
and saying to myself,

207
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,451
"God, look at this."

208
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:41,530
But my building's big.
It's a 2 million foot building.

209
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,995
It's a big building. 
But, look at that stuff, huge.

210
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,724
<i>And there are two of them, right? Massive.</i>

211
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,138
<i>I said, "Wouldn't it be fantastic</i>
if someday I'll own those?"

212
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:03,314
Got it done. Hence, therein started 
the odyssey, six weeks before 9/11.

213
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,407
<i>- [speaker] I think the Tower</i>
should be built back.

214
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:15,800
<i>I think it should be built tall,</i>
as tall, if not taller.

215
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,236
I like to comment earlier about a
library. I always said I wanted a school.

216
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,280
- [speaker] You could also have
an exhibition hall.

217
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,317
You could have a concert hall.
There's enough room there.

218
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:30,948
- [speaker] How could you build
on sacred grounds?

219
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:34,129
The whole site should be a memorial.

220
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:41,442
- [speaker] Our new World Trade Center
Towers must be at least 111 storeys tall.

221
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:45,987
[crowd applause and cheers]

222
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:50,272
- [Lieber] People are starting to think
about what's going to be created there.

223
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:55,655
<i>And ultimately, there's a debate</i>
about what should happen

224
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,331
at the World Trade Center site, 
which is classic New York,

225
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:00,650
with everybody taking very strong opinions

226
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,891
that pull in totally opposite directions,

227
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:07,760
<i>where a lot of different people are</i>
fighting for the one thing that they want.

228
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:11,890
What ought to be rebuilt there?
How do we respond to 9/11?

229
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,648
- [Rosaleen Tallon] I should call Sally 
and tell them I'm two minutes away.

230
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:23,320
Excuse me. Sorry.

231
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:26,545
See, if you get behind 
these slow people, you know.

232
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,670
- <i>How are you doing, Rosaleen?</i>
- Good to see you. Hi, Dorman.

233
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:39,590
[people chattering]

234
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,885
Good morning. 
My name is Rosaleen Tallon.

235
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,462
This is my mother, Eileen.

236
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:52,525
We lost my brother, Sean Patrick Tallon.
He was a probationary firefighter

237
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:56,472
at Ladder 10, which is the firehouse
at the World Trade Center.

238
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:02,813
If you look at Oklahoma City,
those families are really an integral

239
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:06,470
part of the process to
decision-making process.

240
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,522
So, to say at a minimum,
that's what we're asking.

241
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,362
Include us in the process.

242
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:13,572
Because to this point, 
we have not been included.

243
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,615
[dog barking in distant]

244
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:18,007
[kids playing in distant]

245
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:21,880
<i>We knew he was always going to be</i>
either a policeman or fireman.

246
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,944
<i>It was just, you know,</i>
as they say,"It's in the Irish."

247
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:29,602
The first tower collapsed. 
And then, we arrived home

248
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:35,283
and we watched the tower on TV
and we knew that Sean was up there

249
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:38,123
because his company 
would've been first on the scene.

250
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,812
So, there was no doubt in our minds
that he was in there.

251
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:53,959
<i>I remember standing at the precipice,</i>
right outside the firehouse door.

252
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:58,793
<i>These people are buried inside there.</i>

253
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:02,160
I mean, loved ones. I mean,
knowing Sean was in there,

254
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,258
I mean, my God, 
like looking at that pile,

255
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:07,607
and knowing that my little brother
was in there

256
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:09,800
and there wasn't anything 
I could do about it.

257
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:16,666
<i>Because of the enormity of what happened</i>
and all of these people died in there,

258
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:21,691
<i>my parents were definitely hoping</i>
that the site could, say,

259
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:24,450
<i>be a green field of remembrance.</i>

260
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,883
But we realized that wasn't going to be.

261
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:30,529
There were too many commercial
and real estate interests that

262
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:34,844
you know, they had to build back up
their square footage.

263
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:41,151
<i>- [Pataki] One of the things</i>
that people don't appreciate is that

264
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:45,313
<i>there was an enormous economic fallout</i>
after September 11th.

265
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:49,647
We lost a 100,000 private sector jobs
that morning.

266
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:53,245
<i>We lost millions of square feet</i>
of office space.

267
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:58,261
<i>Companies were leaving New York,</i>
so it had to get built.

268
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:02,180
<i>And the initial plan was,</i>
let the Port Authority do it.

269
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:07,512
THE PORT AUTHORITY

270
00:19:07,878 --> 00:19:10,812
- [Kenneth Ringler] I was having dinner
at a local pub around the corner

271
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:13,440
from my apartment and somebody was
sitting next to me and they said,

272
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,902
"So, what do you do?" and I said,
"Well, I run the Port Authority."

273
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,351
And they said, "Does that mean you
do the bus scheduling?"

274
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,439
And I had to explain that 
the Port Authority

275
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,944
was a little more
than the bus terminal.

276
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:27,729
- [Lieber] Port Authority built 
the Lincoln Tunnel

277
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:31,800
and George Washington Bridge

278
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,749
and many of our biggest
transportation facilities

279
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:36,914
and also built the World Trade Center.

280
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:44,125
<i>- [Silverstein] I obligated myself to pay</i>
the ground rent of $120 million a year

281
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,795
<i>to the Port Authority for 99 years,</i>

282
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:51,745
which is like in perpetuity with 
no abatements of any kind

283
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:53,394
'cause no one anticipated the 9/11 event.

284
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:56,169
- [Kenneth] You know, it stuck in his
craw that he had to do that.

285
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:00,100
But, the fact of the matter is,
he was insured to do that.

286
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,658
It's called business 
interruption insurance.

287
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,230
And you continue paying your rent.

288
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,213
- [Raab] Here is Larry Silverstein paying,

289
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:09,294
I think, $10 million a month 
ground rent at nothing.

several hours after the Twin Towers fell.

294
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:25,523
<i>The owner of the 47-storey building</i>
hopes to break ground on a new structure

295
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:26,865
<i>on September 11th.</i>

296
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,110
<i>- [Silverstein] So, once we started</i>
designing the building,

297
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,312
<i>people came out of the woodwork and said,</i>

298
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:36,723
"Silverstein, you're crazy.
No one's gonna come back down.

299
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,812
I mean, this is foolhardy. Second of all, 
you got that burning mass

300
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:43,913
immediately to the South area,
it's ground zero. It's a mess.

301
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:49,473
I mean, how is anybody gonna 
come back around? It's foolishness.

302
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:53,240
I mean, you're really doing yourself
irreparable harm."

303
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:57,283
<i>- [Lieber] 7 World trade Center,</i>
we wereable to get the building going

304
00:20:57,283 --> 00:21:00,832
<i> very quickly, because it was</i>
just us and the Port Authority

305
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:03,940
and that was it. 
We didn't have to deal with

306
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,123
a ton of different government agencies.
Across the street was totally different.

307
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:13,636
<i>On the city side, we had the Mayor,</i>
the Economic Development Corporation,

308
00:21:13,636 --> 00:21:15,400
<i>the Industrial Development Agency,</i>

309
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,381
<i>the Department</i>
of Environmental Protection,

310
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:20,928
<i>the Department of Transportation,</i>
Department of Design and Construction,

311
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:23,152
<i>the Police Department,</i>
the Fire Department,

312
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:26,675
<i>the Buildings Department,</i>
the City Council and

313
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:28,574
<i>the Local Community Board.</i>

314
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:32,260
<i>On the State level, we had</i>
the Empire State Development Corporation,

315
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,101
<i>the Department</i>
of Environmental Conservation,

316
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:36,869
<i>the State Historic Preservation Office,</i>

317
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,243
<i>the New York State Department</i>
of Transportation,

318
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:42,150
<i>the New York State Office</i>
of Emergency Management,

319
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,680
<i>and then, even at the Federal level,</i>
we had Congress,

320
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,450
<i>we had the White House,</i>

321
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,838
<i>Department of Housing</i>
and Urban Development

322
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:51,284
<i>the Federal Department</i>
of Homeland Security,

323
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:55,390
<i>FEMA, SBA, EDA, OSHA,</i>

324
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,376
<i>and not to forget</i>
the Army Corps of Engineers,

325
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:02,102
<i>so it just went on and on and on.</i>

326
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:08,278
- [Betts] I started calling meetings
of the heads of all the agencies

327
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:14,370
and Silverstein's is on. And the meetings
had 50, 60 people in the room.

328
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:18,334
It was completely unworkable.
Tremendous cross currents.

329
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:25,937
Silverstein and the Port Authority
wanted a 10 million square feet of

330
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:30,187
<i>office space and at the other end,</i>
some victim families wanted this

331
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:31,917
<i>to be hollowed ground.</i>
They wanted nothing.

332
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,407
<i>There was another group</i>
that said that they wanted to see the

333
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:37,935
<i>Twin Towers rebuilt exactly</i>
as the Twin Towers.

334
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:41,297
From the beginning,
I was pretty pessimistic

335
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:44,214
that this could actually be coralled.

336
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,264
<i>- [Raab] Once the site was cleaned up,</i>
people expected something to arise

337
00:22:51,264 --> 00:22:53,804
<i>magically from the dust. Hey,</i>
it's New York City,

338
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:55,804
<i>let's get it done yesterday.</i>

339
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:58,607
But I don't think people 
get the complexity of the site

340
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:03,231
especially below grade and the fact
that it's literally a couple hundred feet

341
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:06,967
from a big river and that it ain't easy
to keep that river from pushing

342
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:10,202
through the earth on this site.
And in fact, that was one of the

343
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:14,110
most daunting, if not the most daunting
challenge of the original building,

344
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,659
the original Twin Towers was,
how do you keep the Hudson River out?

345
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,661
<i>- [Announcer] The site actually consisted</i>
of water log landfill,

346
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:28,475
<i>which had accumulated over two centuries</i>
out of old wharves and debris.

347
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:33,365
<i>To support the great weight of the towers,</i>
foundations had had to be dug

348
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:37,309
<i>down 70 feet to bedrock.</i>
An underground wall was built

349
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:41,895
<i>completely sealing the site.</i>
Excavation began.

350
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,468
- [Pataki] Given the ownership,
given the emotion,

351
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:48,447
given that the technical 
engineering challenges,

352
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:52,290
you couldn't have a more difficult site.
But everybody knew that.

353
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:55,230
And it's what you have.

354
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:09,126
- [Betts] What we decided to do was,
engage a firm called, Beyer Blinder Belle.

355
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:13,958
And so, Beyer Blinder Belle came in
and they became the architects of record.

356
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:19,311
- [Philip] They were hired by the LMDC
to just crunch the numbers

357
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:24,614
<i>and show what could happen spatially</i>
in that place, using these numbers

358
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:26,313
<i>dictated by Larry Silverstein's lease.</i>

359
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:29,173
<i>With this big pile of square footage</i>
and this kinda little area,

360
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:31,457
<i>what are we gonna doand what's possible?</i>

361
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:35,606
So, Beyer Blinder Belle was working 
on these designs and the public

362
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:41,178
desire for a meaningful, symbolic
architectural solution reserved

363
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:44,746
building through the months and they
happen to converge in public

364
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:49,429
in the Javits Center, in this 
very hi-tech, super managed,

365
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:51,742
so-called 21st century town meeting.

366
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:56,921
- [Reporter] Six proposals are on
the table. Today, 5000 New Yorkers

367
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:59,497
will have a chance to voice 
their opinions about those plans

368
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,111
at a meeting called,
<i>Listening to the City.</i>

369
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:07,497
[people chattering]

370
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:10,330
- [speaker] The footprints is not to
sort of acknowledge some great

371
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,117
architecture, but the place is 
sort of charged with meaning

372
00:25:13,117 --> 00:25:19,251
and so many loved ones in layers,
that it is one way to have a somber,

373
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,970
yet, not offensive memorial.

374
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:31,296
- [speaker] I just wanna see as much left 
that was there before September 11th,

375
00:25:31,477 --> 00:25:36,513
still there after this 
scariest memory constructed.

376
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,597
<i>- [Betts] And everybody could participate.</i>

377
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:40,837
<i>They had little computer boards there.</i>
Everybody could vote for anything.

378
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:43,519
And everybody could talk and so on.

379
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,507
<i>- [speaker] Sometimes, when you look</i>
at all of this, you wonder,

380
00:25:45,507 --> 00:25:47,290
<i>"Where's the memorial?"</i>

381
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,397
Have we just moved on and 
created tax-free shopping days?

382
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:52,924
- [speaker] We don't like the fact
that green as an isolated rectangle

383
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:56,200
with buildings around it.
- Not enough green.

384
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,195
<i>- Go back to this drawing book.</i>
- Strongly, this is strongly helpful.

385
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:01,294
<i>- Get new architects.</i>

386
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,262
<i>- [Betts] And the comments in real time,</i>
would show up on a screen

387
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:07,731
<i>'cause the typing</i>
would show right up there.

388
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,242
<i>And then people would vote</i>
for what they like and didn't like.

389
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:14,609
And somewhere about two-thirds the way
through the meeting,

390
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,925
a comment showed up on the screen saying,

391
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:20,248
"I hate all these plans.
They look like Albany."

392
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:24,219
Okay, and I really think 
that captured the day

393
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:27,498
because I think everybody looked as if,
"Yeah, they kinda do."

394
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:32,472
- [Pataki] It was a perfectly good plan
for a site that didn't have

395
00:26:32,472 --> 00:26:36,386
the emotional and historic 
importance to America.

396
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:41,528
But from that sense, it was unacceptable.
So at that point, we said no.

397
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:46,900
- [Philip] After the Beyer Blinder Belle
plans were essentially shut down,

398
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:53,667
you know, publicly, at the Javits Center,
the Pataki messaging machine

399
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:57,358
was in a little bit of a crisis
because the election was approaching

400
00:26:57,358 --> 00:27:02,882
and the idea that he "wasn't doing
enough at Ground Zero fast enough."

401
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:04,577
had already been injected
into the campaign.

402
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:08,470
And then, there was a moment of the LMDC

403
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,645
sort of casting around, saying, 
"What now?"

404
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:15,440
- [Betts] I called an emergency meeting
of the LMDC and I said,

405
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,642
"Look, we gotta scrap this thing.
This is nowhere. These plans stink.

406
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:25,752
Everybody knows they stink.
And we gotta do something."

407
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:27,118
"Okay, well what do you wanna do?"

408
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:30,680
I said, "I wanna have an architectural
competition. A true competition."

409
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:33,220
- [Pataki] We are going to go out
and have a process

410
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,194
and engage some of the 
world's greatest architects.

411
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,550
<i>- [Philip] And the next step</i>
was to seek out the visionaries.

412
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:07,235
<i>- [Announcer] The LMDC is now looking</i>
for new international design teams

413
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:11,316
<i>to come up with still more concepts</i>
using broad guidelines that include,

414
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:14,870
<i>a tall symbol or structure</i>
seen in the skyline,

415
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,430
<i>the footprints of the original Twin Towers</i>
would remain undeveloped.

416
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:23,359
<i>- [Philip] By the following December,</i>
every network in the world,

417
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,829
<i>set up to film this dramatic unveiling</i>
of the new future of Ground Zero.

418
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,691
<i>- [Betts] We're about to see</i>
seven very different visions

419
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:36,506
by some extraordinary thinkers
in their approach to the restoration

420
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,234
of hope and optimism to Lower Manhattan.

421
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:42,109
- [Architect] We tried to make with
these united towers,

422
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:46,456
<i>what we call, "The City in the Sky,"</i>
which at the 60th floor.

423
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:48,848
<i>These towers come together and join.</i>

424
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:52,219
- [Architect] The two tall towers in
the middle are at least 1400 feet tall.

425
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:56,021
They symbolize triumph. 
They're sort of universal.

426
00:28:56,021 --> 00:28:58,370
They're standing there on big shoulders
with their hands in the air.

427
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,109
- [Architect] A natural fact. 
It's two towers, which kiss

428
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,665
and touch and become one.

429
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:07,522
<i>- [Daniel Libeskind] When I first started</i>
on the competition, everybody had an idea.

430
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:11,321
Every New Yorker, every member 
of the family, every uncle, aunt, niece,

431
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:16,150
nephew, every acquaintance. 
When they found out that I was doing it,

432
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:20,838
"I have an idea. Do this, do this."
And it suddenly occurred to me

433
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:24,446
that this was really not just 
an architectural issue,

434
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:27,460
it was an issue of the soul of people,

435
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,582
because everyone was somehow,
part of that day.

436
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:34,907
- [Betts] We had a broad spectrum,

437
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:38,300
but it was clear that there 
were two that emerged.

438
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:42,314
One was Daniel Libeskind 
and one was Rafael Viñoly.

439
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:48,926
- [Rafael Viñoly] We started 
this process, essentially by defining

440
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:54,312
for ourselves a principle, what we felt
was moral obligation,

441
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:58,760
which was not only to remember
the ones that perished in this tragedy,

442
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,931
but also, to use their memory 
to elevate our memory

443
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:06,633
to become the inspiration
for a better future.

444
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,706
- [Betts] The Viñoly plan was 
very, very different.

445
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:17,597
<i>The Viñoly plan had these round cylinders,</i>
if you will, that you could see through.

446
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:22,155
<i>The idea was that they were preserving</i>
as a hollowed ground

447
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:27,360
the space in which people died.
Well, this was spunky.

448
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:31,648
This was really different
and really interesting.

449
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:35,453
<i>- [Viñoly] The skyland of Manhattanis</i>
re-structured, re-constructed

450
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:40,300
with the icons of the public life.Thanks.

451
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:43,567
[crowd applause]

452
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:49,879
<i>- [Betts] I'm now happy</i>
to present Daniel Libeskind.

453
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:52,026
[applause]

454
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:55,000
- [Libeskind] Thanks.Thank you very much.

455
00:30:55,688 --> 00:31:00,213
<i>I arrived by ship to New York</i>
as a teenager, an immigrant.

456
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:05,748
and like millions of others before me,
my first sight was that of the

457
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:09,159
Statue of LIberty and the 
amazing skyline of Manhattan.

458
00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:14,245
I have never forgotten that sight
or what it actually stands for.

459
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:16,969
This is what this project is all about.

460
00:31:17,383 --> 00:31:19,995
- [Philip] Everyone had been looking
for a leader or you know,

461
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:23,480
someone to put a non-political,
non-bureaucratic face in the process

462
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,171
and all of a sudden, arrives this guy
with the perfect back story

463
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:30,855
and you know, the ability to present
it, you know, super effectively.

464
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:34,894
- [Libeskind] I grew up in Poland. 
Then to America, where my father had

465
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:39,016
his only surviving sisters who
were an Al Fritz, from a family

466
00:31:39,016 --> 00:31:43,548
of ten brothers and sisters, so he was 
determined to come to New York.

467
00:31:43,957 --> 00:31:47,253
<i>It represented everything that people</i>
dreamed about and it still does.

468
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:54,458
Those who are lost have become heroes.
To commemorate those lost lives,

469
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:00,993
I created two large public spaces.
The park of heroes and the wedge of light.

470
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:10,550
The sky will become home again to
a towering spire 1776 feet tall,

471
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:16,102
creating an icon that speaks to our
vitality in the face of danger

472
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,818
and our optimism in the 
aftermath of tragedy.

473
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:23,326
- [Philip] When asked to do this thing,
which is so impossible

474
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:27,993
that it's almost magic, you know, 
architects can fill in the difference

475
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:31,729
by attaching words to the project.
People understand words.

476
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:39,175
And Libeskind's architecture always 
comes heavily loaded with words.

477
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:43,743
<i>And the design he presented at Ground Zero</i>
with the matrix of heroes

478
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:47,838
<i>and the wedge of light and the tower</i>
that through a tight, somehow spoke

479
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:49,786
<i>about the Declaration of Independence.</i>

480
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:54,717
<i>All of that stuff bridges the gap between</i>
what can be, you know,

481
00:32:54,717 --> 00:32:58,789
<i>very funny looking architecture and things</i>
that real people can actually understand,

482
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:01,819
because "I'm gonna make you feel better
about September 11th,"

483
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:03,528
is not a thing
that a building can say.

484
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:07,383
- [Libeskind] It's 1776 feet high,
very important and it is not just about

485
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:10,213
nations, it's about ecological zones,
ecological regions.

486
00:33:10,213 --> 00:33:13,633
The twenty upper storeys will be 
developed into very spectacular--

487
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:15,804
it's like a park standing vertically
and of course--

488
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:19,880
<i>- [Philip] Daniel Libeskind read</i>
the political landscape perfectly

489
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,439
<i>and pitched to the city in the world</i>
and the powers that be, kind of merging

490
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:28,620
of you know, a hip architecture 
that was also flag-waving.

491
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,528
[crowd applause]

492
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:36,133
<i>- [Betts] I was so engaged in it.</i>
I thought it was phenomenal.

493
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:38,239
<i>But I didn't know</i>
what other people would think.

494
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:42,700
So, I went home that night 
and I started looking at newspapers

495
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,266
and I looked around tomorrow
morning's papers.

496
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:49,345
I looked, there's a site where you
can find every newspaper in the world.

497
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:54,849
<i>And I must've looked at 300 that night.</i>
I did it almost all night just looking.

498
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,115
<i>I just can't believe it. I tell my wife,</i>
"Look at this, God."

499
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:02,163
You know, in the middle of nowhere,
Malaysia... and here it is.

500
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:05,863
<i>One or more of those images</i>
was on the front page

501
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:08,867
<i>of every newspaper in the world.</i>

502
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:13,210
And I think that wasn't lost 
on Viñoly and Libeskind

503
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,414
and somebody was gonna win and therefore,
the stakes were unbelievably high

504
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:21,933
and they wanted to win. 
So, it did get a little naughty.

505
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:26,560
- [Philip] After Libeskind and THINK were
sort of selected as finalist,

506
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,680
there was, you know, 
campaigns of muttering.

507
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:37,467
- [Libeskind] You know, everybody wants
to win and you know, if you're naive,

508
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:40,148
you don't know what kind of forces
are arrayed against you.

509
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:44,353
There was not a minute
that it was just, "Go, relax."

510
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:50,547
You know, meditate. It was a constant
passionate sort of struggle.

511
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:53,753
<i>- [Philip] And the kind of things,</i>
you know, that sort of rovey

512
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:57,218
<i>on political tactics,</i>
taken into the world of architecture

513
00:34:57,218 --> 00:35:01,812
and being propagated by amateurs.
So it was a good time for all.

514
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:06,646
- [Lieber] It was blood sport and these
guys were going for the biggest prize

515
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:11,125
<i>the architecture had ever seen.</i>
And there's a lot at stake for that.

516
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,473
- [Philip] Libeskind had chosen to leave
the pit empty, preserved as a memorial,

517
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:21,785
<i>so his opponents started whispering</i>
that it was a pit of death

518
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:24,534
<i>and an open grave and kind of,</i>
you know, there's a lot of ways

519
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:27,548
<i>to see how that gesture</i>
could be perceived as inappropriate.

520
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:34,199
And then, the THINK team went 
you know, very high up in the air

521
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:38,182
with these open steel-- 
kind of Eiffel towers, so the Libeskinds

522
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:41,330
<i>started saying that they were</i>
skeletons in the sky.

523
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:55,182
- [Betts] So, we finally came to the
point of determining who we wanted to win

524
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:57,918
and we chose Viñoly's plan.

525
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:04,380
<i>- [Libeskind] It was early in the morning.</i>
I remember being in a car,

526
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,214
taxi in New York, going somewhere
Lower Manhattan and the headline,

527
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:10,856
the day before the competition
was to be judged in the <i>New York Times</i>

528
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:15,940
<i>was "Scheme selected, scheme ex-selected."</i>

529
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:17,676
<i>Was that my scheme?</i>

530
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,691
And of course, when I read that headline, 
I was crushed.

531
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:25,341
- [Pataki] I remember waking up
in the morning seeing the front page

532
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:29,913
of the <i>Times</i> that the LMDC is going
to choose the Viñoly plan and going,

533
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:35,450
"No, this can't be." 
Because I thought, the Viñoly plan,

534
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,520
one was, unbuildable, two was,
economically unsound and three,

535
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,879
<i>were the footprints where had these</i>
skeletons really rising into the sky

536
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:48,887
that to me symbolize 
the destruction of the past,

537
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:54,307
instead of the hope of the future.
And I just thought it was a terrible idea.

538
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:59,228
- [Betts] He just ripped Viñoly's plan.
And he said it looks like these oil tanks

539
00:36:59,228 --> 00:37:03,784
<i>in New Jersey and no one's ever</i>
gonna want to walk in there,

540
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:07,140
<i>or they're gonna fall down,</i>
just all this stuff.

541
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:11,763
So now, we were in a pretty awful position
here because the LMDC had voted,

542
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:15,502
not just as a site committee,
but as the full LMDC

543
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:19,616
and expressed a clear preference
for Viñoly and basically,

544
00:37:19,616 --> 00:37:24,410
Pataki came in and kinda just pulled
the rug out from under the LMDC

545
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,523
and you know, he just 
reversed the decision.

546
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:29,250
- [Pataki] How are you? Good to see you.

547
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,729
- [Libeskind] Great day. 
This is a great day.

548
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:34,859
- [Betts] And so, in a sense,
the Libeskind plan became his plan.

549
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:39,989
- [Libeskind] It suddenly dawned on me
what immense responsibility I have.

550
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:46,366
It wasn't just all great. Oh my, God. 
Now, with these few lines on paper,

551
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:52,564
how am I going to be able to do
what I promised to do?

552
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:55,965
<i>- [Announcer] Out of this gaping wound</i>
in of the heart of

553
00:37:55,965 --> 00:37:59,885
<i>the New York Financial Center, where</i>
the 1300 foot tall Twin Towers once stood,

554
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:03,775
<i>an even taller building will rise.</i>

555
00:38:04,555 --> 00:38:08,533
- [Pataki] The design plan 
has an inspiring spire.

556
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,450
- [Libeskind] It is the biggest challenge.
The most profoundly moving

557
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,265
emotionally intellectual, 
architecturally spiritual project

558
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:15,700
I've ever done here, of course.

559
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,261
<i>- [Philip] For three months, Libeskind</i>
gave Pataki everything he needed.

560
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:21,636
[Libeskind laughs]

561
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:26,910
<i>He got in front of any camera</i>
and told a gripping story

562
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,455
<i>and there was imagery to attach to it.</i>

563
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:30,500
[bell ringing]

564
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,432
<i>And he was ringing</i>
the right political bells

565
00:38:32,432 --> 00:38:34,373
<i>and everyone was happy.</i>

566
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:36,611
Except for Larry Silverstein.

567
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:43,413
- [Lieber] Larry actually preferred 
Libeskind's entry to the others.

568
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:48,518
<i>But once it became clear that Libeskind</i>
wanted to design the building,

569
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:52,945
in addition to being the master planner,
we did get into a little conflict with him

570
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:57,362
<i>because Libeskind had done a couple</i>
of buildings of moderate size,

571
00:38:57,362 --> 00:39:02,621
<i>some architecturally dramatic ones,</i>
including the museum in Berlin.

572
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,453
But he had not done a skyscraper,
he had not done very tall tower,

573
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:08,750
which is a completely different exercise.

574
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:13,420
- [Betts] What Libeskind was picked for
was the master plan.

575
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,886
He was not picked to design and build 
skyscrapers, something he had never done.

576
00:39:19,764 --> 00:39:22,462
<i>- [Lieber] So, as Larry Silverstein</i>
explained to Libeskind once when

577
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:25,346
<i>we were having a meeting, he said,</i>
"Dan, if I'm gonna have open heart

578
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:29,114
<i>surgery, I wanna have somebody</i>
who's done it before.

579
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:35,163
And a building of 1700 feet in height,
is the architectural equivalent

580
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:36,785
of open heart surgery."

581
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:42,388
And Dan's wife, who is his partner,
you know, in his practice said,

582
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:45,360
"He's a quick learner," and Larry said,

583
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,559
"Not on my heart, you're not gonna learn
how to do open heart surgery."

584
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:50,757
- [Silverstein] This meeting's over.
We're done.

585
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:52,358
She says, "Don't get excited."

586
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:55,367
I said, "I'm not excited," I said,
"Just wanna say this meeting's over.

587
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,321
I'm having no further discussion
about the redesign.

588
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,400
It's off the table. Finished.

589
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:04,420
- [Libeskind] Here's a man with money,
with power, with the idea that

590
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,187
it belongs to him, he had his own ideas
with his own architects.

591
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,773
- [David Childs] Larry came to me 
and he said, "Your trade in life,

592
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:17,874
what you're a specialist is, 
is tall office buildings.

593
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,520
I need you to do this."

594
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:23,879
- [Lieber] Larry announced the truth,
which is he's gonna do the building

595
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:28,325
with the architect he chose,
which is David Childs,

596
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,988
from Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

597
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:32,719
<i>He did the Worldwide Plaza building,</i>

598
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,287
<i>he did the Bank</i>
of New York Operations Center,

599
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:37,287
<i>he's done a lot of big buildings.</i>

600
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,807
- [Libeskind] David is a, you know,
very accomplished, very powerful

601
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:43,663
architect running a firm 
of thousands of people.

602
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:48,832
You know, it was really kind of
<i>David and Goliath.</i> [laughs]

603
00:40:48,832 --> 00:40:55,370
- [Childs] It was a functioning, operating
office building in a capitalistic society.

604
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,682
This was not just a piece of 
sculpture there in the air.

605
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:03,938
<i>Some time in the middle of the summer,</i>
we were summoned to a meeting

606
00:41:03,938 --> 00:41:08,404
<i>at the offices of the LMDC</i>
and there was a negotiation.

607
00:41:08,404 --> 00:41:11,945
- [Philip] Libeskind and Childs were
literally thrown into a room together.

608
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:17,381
- [Childs] You've gotta have somebody
in charge. You can't have two generals.

609
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:21,399
You've gotta have one 
that has 51% of the vote.

610
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,266
And so, that's what I insisted on.

611
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:27,792
[people chattering]

612
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:29,911
- [Libeskind] This is not a press 
conference. This is a photo op.

613
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:32,511
<i>- [reporter] Have you ever seen</i>
happier faces in your life?

614
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:35,930
- [Silverstein] Once or twice.
- [Libeskind] It's a great day.

615
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:37,950
<i>Fantastic collaboration. </i>

616
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,619
Wait, we have to roll up our sleeves. 
We gotta get to work.

617
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,540
- [Childs] If body language says anything,
this is the picture.

618
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:46,201
<i>- [reporter] What's the reality?</i>

619
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:47,829
- [Libeskind] It's real, it's real.

620
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:49,324
[cameras clicking]

621
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:50,963
- [Silverstein] Okay, let's go.
Thank you.

622
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:54,146
Right behind you.
Keep going, keep going.

623
00:41:54,804 --> 00:42:00,830
- [Libeskind] David, they want us--- 
[Childs] This is our scheme,

624
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,547
see how well-- 
[Libeskind laughing]

625
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:05,127
<i>- [Lieber] But it was very clear</i>
from the beginning that these guys

626
00:42:05,127 --> 00:42:07,969
<i>did not look at things the same way.</i>

627
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:11,177
Childs and his team would present,
you know, technical issues

628
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:14,685
and how they propose to solve
them or options for solving them

629
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:19,923
and Libeskind's comments tended
to be focused on more ethereal,

630
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:26,420
symbolic and general issues, you know. 
I think Dan said,

631
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,847
"The top has to be more meaningful."
And that you could see

632
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:30,320
that Childs' blood rising.

633
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,765
- [Childs] I think that in fact, that
Libeskind thought that he would have

634
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:42,123
a more of a role than I was gonna be
somehow change and be willing to

635
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:49,523
just execute his role as a designer.
Frankly, Larry wouldn't permit that.

636
00:42:49,657 --> 00:42:53,248
- [Libeskind] He's an industrialist.
He wants to make profits.

637
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,412
He has an empire, you know.
It's not the philanthropic enterprise,

638
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:01,736
it's how to create profits,
which I appreciate.

639
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:05,815
Now, what would New York be 
if people were not entrepreneurial

640
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:12,888
to want make money. But that often came
into tension with other ideas.

641
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:20,978
- [Pataki] When our work is done,
the history of Lower Manhattan

642
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:23,524
would have been written, 
not by the terrorists

643
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:25,572
who attacked our city,

644
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:28,465
<i>but by the millions of New Yorkers,</i>
who stood up to defend it.

645
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:34,127
By the 5th anniversary of the attack,
September 11th 2006,

646
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:40,342
we will top off a new icon.
The 1776-foot tall Freedom Tower.

647
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:43,625
[applause]

648
00:43:44,162 --> 00:43:46,732
- [Raab] My vast--people 
close to the governor,

649
00:43:46,732 --> 00:43:50,349
was that political calculation
or a spur of the moment,

650
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:53,616
naming it, "The Freedom Tower."
And the best answer I've heard

651
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:58,144
is that it had been discussed,
but no one had really signed off on it

652
00:43:58,144 --> 00:44:00,988
and no one was sure of it until it came
out of his mouth during the speech.

653
00:44:00,988 --> 00:44:04,236
- [Pataki] What is 1776?
It's a symbol of our freedom.

654
00:44:04,236 --> 00:44:06,971
It's the year we proclaimed
our independence.

655
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:12,823
So it just made sense that word just
kinda fell in and fit the building.

656
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:16,343
<i>- [Philip] There's a letter in the </i>
New York Post <i>that was brilliant.</i>

657
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:20,629
<i>The letter said, "This building is nothing</i>
but a perch for George Pataki

658
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:23,245
<i>to climb up and gaze off</i>
in the direction of Washington."

659
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:29,490
And that was true. Pataki was
actively using the process to further

660
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,155
his political ambition
as any politician would.

661
00:44:33,878 --> 00:44:36,471
- [Pataki] Good morning.
We're here today for the unveiling

662
00:44:36,471 --> 00:44:38,673
of the model of the Freedom Tower.

663
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:44,830
When Daniel Libeskind revealed
his master site plan, the idea was

664
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:48,491
to create a building, the tallest
building in the world, yes,

665
00:44:48,491 --> 00:44:55,997
but symbolically, 1776 feet tall.
But mostly today, is a celebration

666
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:59,874
of the successful collaboration
of two brilliant architects,

667
00:44:59,874 --> 00:45:02,743
who understand that 
this is not just a building,

668
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:04,579
this is a symbol of freedom.

669
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:09,453
So to Daniel Libeskind and to
David Childs, congratulations.

670
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:11,590
[cameras clicking]

671
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:16,543
[applause]

672
00:45:17,973 --> 00:45:19,707
- That's it?
- That's it.

673
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:24,562
Don't trip now as we go on there.

674
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:27,586
[people chattering]

675
00:45:27,586 --> 00:45:30,267
[cameras clicking]

676
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:34,816
[people chatting]

677
00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:38,272
<i>- [Philip] When Libeskind and Childs</i>
allegedly started working together,

678
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:43,400
<i>the kind of face saving design that came</i>
out of that, had this big stick on top.

679
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:49,587
And that stick and the numbers 
1776 were the only thing

680
00:45:49,587 --> 00:45:52,447
that survived of the original
Libeskind concept.

681
00:45:53,575 --> 00:45:56,255
<i>They presented this huge model</i>
that was 10 feet tall or something.

682
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:59,268
<i>It lit from within and who knows</i>
how much money was spent on it.

683
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,364
And as they were moving it 
out of the Federal Hall,

684
00:46:02,364 --> 00:46:06,150
where they had the presentation,
the S-1 guys broke the stick off,

685
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,635
so it could clear the door, you know.

686
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:11,140
And that was the last
we saw of Danny's stick.

687
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:20,120
<i>- [Rosaleen] No matter what people talk</i>
about, buildings or their real estate,

688
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,425
<i>Ground Zero is ground zero</i>
for what happened there.

689
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:25,959
So, the most important thing was
how we were gonna remember

690
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:27,977
what happened there to those people.

691
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:32,262
- [speaker] And this eternal flame
will be visible, just like the tower was,

692
00:46:32,262 --> 00:46:35,498
so you don't have to come to this
memorial to remember what happened here.

693
00:46:35,498 --> 00:46:37,766
- [speaker] The key feature of my design
is that every visitor

694
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:41,250
will clearly visualize and absorb
the enormity of the sacrifice.

695
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,589
Every victim will be represented

696
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:48,700
by his or her own individual
life-sized human statue.

697
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,320
- [speaker] We could then have
two or three foot crystal birds.

698
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,672
One for each life lost.

699
00:46:55,684 --> 00:46:58,970
[applause]

700
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:01,878
<i>- [Pataki] We wanted public involvement,</i>
so we invited submissions.

701
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:02,986
<i>We got thousands.</i>

702
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:07,068
- [Anchorman] More than 5000 people
submitted proposals for a memorial

703
00:47:07,068 --> 00:47:08,737
at the site of the World Trade Center.

704
00:47:08,737 --> 00:47:12,633
<i>Today, a committee chose this one.</i>
It's called, Reflecting Absence.

705
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:15,983
<i>Designed by New Yorker, Michael Arad,</i>
it will include the names

706
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:19,384
<i>of everyone killed in the 9/11 attacks</i>
on the World Trade Center.

707
00:47:27,248 --> 00:47:30,880
- [Michael Arad] I was working as
an assistant architect

708
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,333
for the New York City Housing
Authority, Design Department,

709
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:36,133
when I found out there was a competition
for the design of the memorial,

710
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:39,126
and I had to do this.

711
00:47:39,271 --> 00:47:44,692
There's no sort of rational explanation
for why you get so drawn into it.

712
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:52,580
<i>I came across this quarry in South Orange</i>
and there's just something very beautiful

713
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,470
<i>and evocative about it, because it had</i>
this sort of clearly traced out absence

714
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,971
<i>of all the rock</i>
that had been excavated out,

715
00:47:59,971 --> 00:48:04,906
but was softened by the water
and by the trees and I think that

716
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:09,359
helped me to start thinking about
the Memorial Plaza.

717
00:48:14,243 --> 00:48:18,791
<i>Days after the attack, I remember</i>
biking around Lower Manhattan

718
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,300
<i>at night and I made my way</i>
to Washington Square Park

719
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,114
<i>and I found myself standing</i>
near that central fountain,

720
00:48:25,114 --> 00:48:28,555
<i>the grand fountain.</i>
People placed candles there.

721
00:48:31,146 --> 00:48:33,219
<i>And I felt like I was part of that group.</i>

722
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,359
You know, I came there,
not knowing anybody

723
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,619
and not a word was said.
And I left a few minutes later

724
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,941
without having said anything
to anybody

725
00:48:40,941 --> 00:48:43,194
but, I left completely changed.

726
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:46,641
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
that notion of sort of being

727
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:48,641
<i>cruelly removed from the life of the city,</i>

728
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:53,860
<i>I mean, that just shattered.</i>
And we're part of it, a greater all.

729
00:48:53,402 --> 00:48:54,681
<i>You had to be.</i>

[cycling sound]

731
00:49:04,122 --> 00:49:07,373
<i>- [Rosaleen] Our neighborhood here</i>
in Yonkers is full of police officers

732
00:49:07,373 --> 00:49:12,316
<i>and fire fighters. So, after 9/11,</i>
I met other family members

733
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:16,745
and they were very, very intent
on making sure that,

734
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,248
as they said, the brothers 
were listed with their ranks,

735
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,874
and I thought that was a no-brainer.

736
00:49:22,874 --> 00:49:26,914
So, they asked me, would I care
to join the group, advocating for 9/11

737
00:49:26,914 --> 00:49:31,727
issues, and they seemed like such
a simple thing to become involved in.

738
00:49:31,786 --> 00:49:36,525
- [Betts] I mean, simple things like,
what's the order of the names?

739
00:49:36,525 --> 00:49:40,727
<i>Is it organized alphabetically</i>
by last name?

740
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:45,346
<i>Is it organized alphabetically</i>
by last name within the firemen's group?

741
00:49:45,346 --> 00:49:47,655
Are the firemen over here 
and the police over here?

742
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:50,132
I mean, these are things 
that were debated for years.

743
00:49:51,063 --> 00:49:54,442
<i>- [Lieber] The Mayor started seeing</i>
the Memorial was not coming together

744
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:57,553
<i>as quickly or as well</i>
as everybody had hoped.

745
00:49:57,553 --> 00:50:00,197
And he took ownership of it.
He literally stepped up,

746
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:04,296
became the Chairman of the Board,
raised the money and started

747
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,274

schedules through.

it's his way or the highway.

<i>That's what I have felt.</i>

750
00:50:11,832 --> 00:50:16,146
He's a man that cast us aside
and made us seem like

751
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,961
we couldn't get over our grief.

CITY HALL

753
00:50:24,393 --> 00:50:26,724
- [Michael Bloomberg] People's views
change with time.

754
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:30,597
There's an emotion that, as soon as
you lose a loved one,

755
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:33,417
that it's very different than 
an emotion that you have

756
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:36,615
five and ten and twenty years later.

757
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:42,493
And we have to make sure we don't
respond to the first and in fact,

758
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:44,692
have a better perspective.
That's not to say,

759
00:50:44,692 --> 00:50:48,530
that you treat people cavalierly
or don't listen to them.

760
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,105
- [Rosaleen] The Mayor and the LMDC,
they were able to say,

761
00:50:53,105 --> 00:50:55,522
"Oh, look at these families."

762
00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:59,165
They're constantly complaining.
And then, when other issues came up,

763
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:03,896
"Oh, look, here comes the families again.
They're slowing the process down."

764
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:08,170
They actually blamed us 
for slowing Ground Zero down.

765
00:51:08,259 --> 00:51:11,379
- [Betts] And so, they actually stopped 
bugging the Mayor.

766
00:51:12,126 --> 00:51:15,520
But they went to Pataki and they found
a very receptive ear in Pataki.

767
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:19,452
- [Pataki] We always try to include
family members every step of the way,

768
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:24,730
as decisions were made and listen
to them and when you have,

769
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:26,601
obviously, thousands and thousands
of family members,

770
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:30,631
you're never going to have unanimity,
you're going to have divergent opinions.

of the Governors' race were winding down,

773
00:51:42,588 --> 00:51:45,603
the Republicans announced that
in 2004, they'd be hosting

the Republican Convention. 
You know, in Midtown, but within

allow Ground Zero to be a festering mess

777
00:51:57,153 --> 00:52:01,788
<i>of selfish infighting, as it had become.</i>
We need to show some progress.

778
00:52:02,678 --> 00:52:06,910
- [Pataki] On July 4th, as fireworks
burst in the sky,

779
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:10,670
ephemeral reminders of our liberty,
we will begin to reclaim

our skyline with a permanent
symbol of our freedom.

don't have cornerstones,

it wasn't a construction event.

00:54:29,381 --> 00:54:32,648
the politicians would be in 
the big shot that would end up

base of the Freedom Tower design

Apparently, there were claims

that yes, the NYPD sent a letter,

<i>why are security concerned</i>
just now being presented?

849
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:25,721
- [Bloomberg] Well, they're not just
now being, you couldn't be more wrong.

850
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:29,901
The security concerns 
have been there since 1993.

851
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:32,781
1993, there was a bombing 
at the World Trade Center

852
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:34,994
and we did not learn our lesson.

853
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:37,917
<i>This is a building, particularly,</i>
Freedom Tower,

854

<i>that is built to be a symbol.</i>

855
00:57:40,353 --> 00:57:43,650
And we are not going to rush 
in to doing anything that doesn't

856
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:47,371
take into account the security measures
that the Police Department

857
00:57:47,371 --> 00:57:50,189
and plenty of other people 
think are appropriate.

00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:56,391
<i>- [Lieber] It's impossible to describe</i>
the frustration that we all felt.

859
00:57:56,391 --> 00:58:00,419
In fact, we had to go back
and come up with a new building.

00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,120
- [Silverstein] I was crushed by it,
literally crushed.

861
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:08,784
I felt it was terribly unfair 
and a tragic waste of time,

862
00:58:08,784 --> 00:58:12,029
effort, energy and money,
that was needed for the purpose

863
00:58:12,029 --> 00:58:13,489
of rebuilding the World Trade Center.

864
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:16,658
- [Childs] That changed 
the game, entirely.

865
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:20,772
Because we couldn't modify the building.
We couldn't move it onto another site,

866
00:58:20,772 --> 00:58:24,165
so we were in effect by that decision

867
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:30,646
given a clean slate of
clean sheet of paper to work on.

868
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:35,546
<i>- [Lieber] The building moved</i>
to the east away from the road.

869
00:58:35,893 --> 00:58:40,361
<i>And then, we came up</i>
with a completely new design.

870
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:44,540
- [Anchorman] New York officials today
unveil the latest redesign

871
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,027
of the Freedom Tower to be built 
in Ground Zero with the reinforced

872
00:58:48,027 --> 00:58:54,420
<i>concrete base for bomb protection.</i>
The tower will be 1776 feet tall,

873
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,994
<i>its proportions and external skin</i>
recalling the lost Twin Towers.

874
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:02,753
<i>- [Ringler] I could remember</i>
shuttling back and forth

875
00:59:02,753 --> 00:59:06,210
<i>between Daniel and David,</i>
trying to get Daniel to say

876
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,205
<i>that this is a beautiful building</i>

877
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:10,929
and you know, and he kept looking in.
Finally, he said,

878
00:59:10,929 --> 00:59:12,817
"Yeah, I think I like it.
I think I like it."

879
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:15,844
So, I said, I called up 
Governor's office and said,

880
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,332
"Dan is gonna say nice things. I think 
we're not gonna have an issue here."

881
00:59:18,332 --> 00:59:20,711
- [Libeskind] The tower that we have now,
after all the efforts,

882
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:23,289
is even a better tower 
than we have before.

883
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:25,920
It is a slender tower,
it's an elegant tower,

884
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,882
it's a tower that rises 
in a crystal-like form--

885
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:29,911
<i>- [Betts] Daniel Libeskind was part</i>
of that in name only.

886
00:59:29,911 --> 00:59:34,224
<i>He had absolutely nothing to do with </i>
what we now know as the Freedom Tower.

887
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,819
<i>All that's left of Libeskind's influence</i>
is the height of the building.

888
00:59:37,858 --> 00:59:38,744
[cameras clicking]

889
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:44,720
<i>- [Lieber] The new design was rolled out</i>
without people criticizing it

890
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,979
<i>and we were back in business,</i>
and in fact, building.

891
00:59:48,594 --> 00:59:51,173
<i>- [Anchorman] Well, today our Federal Jury</i>
decided that for insurance purposes,

892
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:55,149
the destruction of the World Trade Center
was two separate events, not one,

893
00:59:55,149 --> 00:59:57,128
as insurance companies were hoping for.

894
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,958
And this means the lease holder, 
Larry Silverstein can collect twice

895
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:03,480
from some companies because
separate planes hit the two towers.

896
01:00:03,095 --> 01:00:06,640
This decision is the latest twist
to Silverstein's effort to turn his

897
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,369
$3.5 billion insurance policy
on the Trade Center Complex,

898
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:12,660
into a $7 billion payout.

899
01:00:12,774 --> 01:00:16,544
- [Lieber] And in the end, we ended up
recovering the equivalent of about

900
01:00:16,544 --> 01:00:20,442
one and a half, 
$4.5 billion dollars of insurance.

901
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:23,433
And mind you, that $4.5 billion 
sounds like a lot of money,

902
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:27,669
but it's not enough money to rebuild
the office space that was destroyed.

903
01:00:27,954 --> 01:00:30,265
- [Ringer] It was decided 
to approach him and say,

904
01:00:30,265 --> 01:00:35,250
"Can we re-negotiate the deal and 
perhaps, lessen your rental obligations,

905
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,955
and return some of the sites 
to the Port Authority

906
01:00:38,955 --> 01:00:41,382
who would then go on 
and develop them."

907
01:00:42,048 --> 01:00:43,295
2006

908
01:00:43,455 --> 01:00:45,650
<i>- [Anchorwoman] A deal must be reached</i>
today between World Trade Center

909
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,491
<i>lease holder Larry Silverstein</i>
and the Port Authority

910
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:48,891
<i>which owns the land</i>

911
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:51,332
<i>on what to do with the site</i>
beyond the Memorial.

912
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,534
<i>Governor Pataki set</i>
the March 14th deadline last year,

913
01:00:54,534 --> 01:00:56,810
<i>in an effort to get</i>
the rebuilding ball rolling.

914
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:00,475
- [Lieber] We gave them proposal after 
proposal, we couldn't get any response.

915
01:01:00,475 --> 01:01:04,320
And they left everything to, 
literally, the last two days.

916
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,360
- [Ringler] We got to the 
day of the deadline

917
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:10,750
and our teams were working 
all day at our offices.

918
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,315
<i>And I was there. I was going from room</i>
to room and we were progressing.

919
01:01:14,315 --> 01:01:18,640
We broke for dinner and hoped 
everybody would be back

920
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,429
by 7:00 or so, and we were gonna 
continue the discussions

921
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:24,105
and hopefully consummate a deal.

922
01:01:25,134 --> 01:01:28,333
And I ordered pizza out for our folks

923
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,838
and we sat around the
conference table eating pizza.

924
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:34,148
As I read later, Larry 
and his team were so ecstatic,

925
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,376
they ordered from a French restaurant
and had a party.

926
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:39,916
And they didn't come back.

927
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:43,260
<i>We kept calling, asking,"Where are you?"</i>

928
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,220
"We're meeting with our key people.
We'll be there. We'll be there."

929
01:01:46,606 --> 01:01:51,343
<i>- [Lieber] And we came back and it was</i>
about 9:00 or so, 9:00 to 9:30.

930
01:01:51,343 --> 01:01:55,470
Larry Silverstein sat down,
drank two cups of coffee

931
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,977
'cause he thought we were gonna
be there for a long time.

932
01:01:57,977 --> 01:02:02,263
- [Ringler] And I think he and his team,
again, it's only my perception,

933
01:02:02,263 --> 01:02:04,805
felt that because there was a deadline
and that we wanted to honor

934
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:09,520
the Governor's wishes, that perhaps there 
was more nickels on the table for him.

935
01:02:11,005 --> 01:02:15,986
<i>I walked down the hall and Larry</i>
and his team were sitting at the table.

936
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:18,412
Everybody's sitting around there, smiling.

937
01:02:18,412 --> 01:02:25,445
And I think I felt like an ancient Roman
going into the Colosseum with the lions.

938
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:29,740
- [Lieber] Ken Ringler came into that
conference room, where we were sitting.

939
01:02:30,263 --> 01:02:36,876
And in very blue language, told us 
to get the "F" outta his office,

940
01:02:36,876 --> 01:02:42,651
to pay our "effing" rent, and you know, 
we were a bunch of bums

941
01:02:42,651 --> 01:02:45,639
and they were coming after us.

942
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:48,539
- [Silverstein] All I remember
was being surprised as hell.

943
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:50,182
Because we genuinely were there

944
01:02:50,182 --> 01:02:54,331
for the purpose of making a deal
with the Port that night, clearly.

945
01:02:57,714 --> 01:03:01,270
And it made no sense to me, 
literally made no sense.

946
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:03,880
And then of course, the next day,
diffused a lot.

947
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,663
- [Ringler] We thought we were moving
in the right direction.

948
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:08,430
Then at 11:35 was it, Sir?
- [speaker] 11:35.

949
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:11,615
11:35, they came back with a proposal,
where their demands

950
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,987
were just as high as they were before,

951
01:03:13,987 --> 01:03:17,452
they're increasing their demands, 
and quite honestly, in my view,

952
01:03:17,452 --> 01:03:20,142
I think they thought they had leverage 
that we were going to back down

953
01:03:20,142 --> 01:03:22,415
because we wanted to get a deal

954
01:03:22,415 --> 01:03:24,859
and we wanted to move
the Freedom Tower forward.

955
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:27,961
We're not going to make short-sight
a deal with Larry Silverstein.

956
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:31,510
- [Silverstein] Negotiation with 
the Port collapsed.

957
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,881
Next thing I know, <i>New York Times,</i>

958
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:37,100
"Governor to Larry Silverstein:
Stand Aside.

959
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,959
You're obstructing progress at the site."

960
01:03:40,878 --> 01:03:42,402
Oh, my God.

961
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,642
- [Ringler] Larry was losing 
the public battle.

962
01:03:44,642 --> 01:03:47,673
And within days, there was a
<i>New York Times</i> editorial,

963
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:50,357
<i>the political leaders galvanized</i>
around it and said,

964
01:03:50,357 --> 01:03:52,233
<i>"No. Enough is enough."</i>

965
01:03:52,233 --> 01:03:56,785
We decided to put an agreement together
and bring it back to Larry

966
01:03:56,785 --> 01:04:01,130
and basically, not say take it 
or leave it, but as I told Larry

967
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,659
when I brought it up to him,

968
01:04:02,659 --> 01:04:06,123
"It's this close to take it or leave it
as we're gonna get."

969
01:04:06,123 --> 01:04:07,491
- [Chuck Scarborough] Good evening.

970
01:04:07,491 --> 01:04:09,895
An agreement between World Trade Center
developer Larry Silverstein

971
01:04:09,895 --> 01:04:12,856
and the Port Authority, means
construction on the Freedom Tower

972
01:04:12,856 --> 01:04:15,721
could finally begin. 
Perhaps, by week's end.

973
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:18,500
- [Sue Simmons] The deal will give
Port Authority control

974
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,840
of the long-delayed Freedom Tower,
but reward Silverstein with three

975
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,437
other prime developing sites along
the eastern side of Ground Zero.

976
01:04:25,621 --> 01:04:28,603
<i>- [Silverstein] That was when</i>
we relinquished control of

977
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:32,682
<i>The Freedom Tower and Tower 5</i>
and kept Towers 2, 3 and 4.

978
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:35,857
<i>Did we think it was fair? Not necessarily.</i>

979
01:04:35,857 --> 01:04:38,468
<i>But the important thing was</i>
to keep the momentum going.

980
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:42,933
- [Lieber] What we got out of the deal 
was a commitment by the Port Authority

981
01:04:42,933 --> 01:04:46,272
<i>that they would dig the hole</i>
on the east side of the site.

982
01:04:46,272 --> 01:04:49,690
<i>The 80-foot hole and put</i>
in the infrastructure and fully prepare

983
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:53,440
<i>those sites for construction.</i>

984
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:55,517
- [Jon Stewart] If you remember,
New York City was attacked

985
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,761
four and a half years ago
and since that time,

986
01:04:57,761 --> 01:05:03,700
we have been locked in a vicious
battle over construction of the

987
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,631
<i>tallest, shiniest, terrorist,</i>
tauntiest skyscraper in the world.

988
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:07,799
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

989
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:11,152
<i>The 1776 foot tall Freedom Tower!</i>

990
01:05:11,152 --> 01:05:13,266
- [Pataki] Today, we lay the cornerstone

991
01:05:13,266 --> 01:05:16,443
<i>for a new symbol of the city</i>
and of this country,

992
01:05:16,443 --> 01:05:19,986
<i>and of our resolve</i>
to triumph in the face of terror.

993
01:05:20,479 --> 01:05:22,953
<i>- [Stewart] So that was the site</i>
two years ago.

994
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:24,513
<i>And today...Oh!</i>

995
01:05:24,513 --> 01:05:25,976
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

996
01:05:25,976 --> 01:05:27,567
[cameras clicking]

997
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,845
- [speaker] Governor, good morning.
- [Pataki] Good morning.

998
01:05:33,091 --> 01:05:35,948
Good morning. 
This is a great day for New York

999
01:05:35,948 --> 01:05:38,810
and a great day for America.
Today, we begin construction

1000
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,190
on the Freedom Tower,the final element--

1001
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:45,218
- [Betts] When the press would start
ranting and raving about no progress,

1002
01:05:45,218 --> 01:05:49,889
there'd be a ceremony.
I never went to any of them.

1003
01:05:49,889 --> 01:05:52,652
[excavator engine running]

1004
01:05:52,652 --> 01:05:54,787
[applause]

1005
01:05:54,787 --> 01:05:56,355
<i>- [Raab] The cornerstone had to come out </i>

1006
01:05:56,355 --> 01:05:59,859
<i>because the Freedom Tower</i>
had to be redesigned.

1007
01:05:59,859 --> 01:06:02,800
<i>The cornerstone had been</i>
sitting in a plywood box.

1008
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:08,223
<i>They're taking this thing out,</i>
not literally under the cover of night,

1009
01:06:08,223 --> 01:06:10,869
<i>but goddamn close to the cover of night.</i>

1010
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:13,966
No one is supposed to know that
they're pulling the--

1011
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:18,448
it's too much of an embarrassment
to let anyone in the media know

1012
01:06:18,448 --> 01:06:19,944
that this is going to happen.

1013
01:06:20,205 --> 01:06:23,543
<i>- [Reporter] What became</i>
of the cornerstone itself?

1014
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:26,464
- [Pataki] I honestly don't know,
but to me, I thought it would be nice

1015
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:31,452
to have it in the lobby of the actual 
Freedom Tower that's constructed.

1016
01:06:31,452 --> 01:06:36,270
I haven't had a chance to 
talk to David Childs about it.

1017
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,661
- [Raab] My joke was always driving
to Pataki's house.

1018
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,507
You know, and put it down his front lawn.

1019
01:06:40,507 --> 01:06:43,660
Ring the doorbell and drive away
as fast as you can.

1020
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:49,410
[laughs]

1021
01:06:50,768 --> 01:06:56,544
<i>[crowd applauding and cheering]</i>

1022
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:07,160
- <i>[speaker] One , two, done.</i>
[crowd cheering]

1023
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:10,750
<i>- [Raab] One of the ironies is</i>
during the middle of all the drama

1024
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:14,755
<i>back in the spring of '06,</i>
we opened 7 World Trade Center.

1025
01:07:14,755 --> 01:07:17,840
- [Betts] That's the best thing Larry did,
was he went in.

1026
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,962
He just plowed ahead, 
rebuilt World Trade Center number 7.

1027
01:07:20,962 --> 01:07:25,308
I think that was important for the public
to see construction and to see action

1028
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:28,919
down there and to see something
coming out of the ground.

1029
01:07:29,426 --> 01:07:33,594
<i>- [Lieber] It saw a finished product.</i>
It saw something that was high-style

1030
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:38,642
<i>that was green and that gave confidence</i>
that downtown could

1031
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,379
<i>and would be reborn</i>
as a business district.

1032
01:07:42,594 --> 01:07:45,177
<i>- [Silverstein] And they looked at</i>
what was going on across the street.

1033
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:48,692
<i>Havoc. I mean, just disaster</i>
across the street, right?

1034
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:52,228
<i> They knowing it was the Port.</i>
Here, we finished a building.

1035
01:07:52,228 --> 01:07:54,100
And all of a sudden, 
people startled and said,

1036
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,953
"What's he doing that's so bad?
What's he doing so wrong?

1037
01:07:56,953 --> 01:07:59,730
Maybe he's the problem."
People started looking and saying,

1038
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:01,650
"Maybe it's he's not the problem."

1039
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:05,894
[water flowing]

1040
01:08:14,668 --> 01:08:17,816
<i>- [Arad] The design initially suggested</i>
these Memorial galleries,

1041
01:08:17,816 --> 01:08:21,486
<i>which would surround the pools</i>
some 30 feet below the plaza.

1042
01:08:21,855 --> 01:08:25,200
And so the idea was that
you would walk up to the--

1043
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:30,187
adrift of these voids, 
sort of peer down below

1044
01:08:30,187 --> 01:08:35,544
and then go on this very,
you know, emotionally fraught

1045
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:39,720
processional experience and sort of 
walking into the area almost

1046
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,865
<i>walking right up to the names,</i>
which would be displayed

1047
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:47,975
<i>behind the waterfalls in this</i>
very sort of quiet, cloister-like space.

1048
01:08:49,605 --> 01:08:53,297
<i>- [Rosaleen] In advocating</i>
for the ranks of the firefighters,

1049
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:57,570
we were invited to Michael Arad's office 
to speak of that

1050
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,206
and we were in the meeting room,
in the conference room,

1051
01:09:00,206 --> 01:09:03,964
and you know, all around were 
aspects of the Memorial.

1052
01:09:03,964 --> 01:09:09,515
<i>But there was a three dimensional model</i>
of the Memorial. And up

1053
01:09:09,515 --> 01:09:13,724
<i>to that point, none of us had really</i>
questioned where the names were going.

1054
01:09:13,724 --> 01:09:17,797
But then we saw the three dimensional 
model and we realized

1055
01:09:17,797 --> 01:09:22,400
the names were gonna be 
underneath the waterfalls

1056
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,379
at the base of the waterfalls,
underground.

1057
01:09:24,379 --> 01:09:29,227
<i>You would have to descend down, almost</i>
as though, you were going into the subway.

1058
01:09:29,227 --> 01:09:34,429
<i>Descend down underground,</i>
into a confined space to view the names.

1059
01:09:34,429 --> 01:09:37,689
<i>And that shocked us.</i>

1060
01:09:38,805 --> 01:09:45,830
Knowing now about 1993, 
about 2001, I will never go down.

1061
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:48,890
I will never bring my children 
underground at Ground Zero

1062
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:54,212
because I feel it's always gonna be the
number one target site of the terrorists.

1063
01:09:54,212 --> 01:09:55,819
<i>They've come twice.</i>

1064
01:09:55,819 --> 01:09:59,624
<i>What better place than to get us</i>
all while we're underground.

1065
01:09:59,624 --> 01:10:02,787
I mean, it just-- 
it never made sense to me.

1066
01:10:03,986 --> 01:10:09,254
<i>- [Arad] It'll be so easy for this design</i>
to be changed in a fundamental way.

1067
01:10:09,254 --> 01:10:13,299
And you know, while every 
suggestion that was made,

1068
01:10:13,299 --> 01:10:15,929
was made by somebody who cares deeply 
about the Memorial,

1069
01:10:15,929 --> 01:10:20,454
was not necessarily consistent
with the design that was selected

1070
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:25,833
and then I felt it was my obligation
to champion and be responsible for it.

1071
01:10:27,209 --> 01:10:30,547
<i>How do you build a moment of silence?</i>
This is what this is.

1072
01:10:35,284 --> 01:10:37,859
- [speaker] Write down the ideas,
because you know, four hours from now--

1073
01:10:39,814 --> 01:10:42,724
This is America's Memorial, 
as they all like to say.

1074
01:10:42,724 --> 01:10:44,723
America doesn't know what she's getting.

1075
01:10:44,723 --> 01:10:47,144
New York is on now, an American self now.

1076
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,427
<i>- [Man] That's insane.</i>
- [Rosaleen] Thank you very much.

1077
01:10:50,427 --> 01:10:53,312
<i>Do you know they're spending</i>
$1.2 billion on this?

1078
01:10:53,312 --> 01:10:55,874
- [speaker] On a Memorial 
that nobody wants.

1079
01:10:55,874 --> 01:10:57,917
- [Rosaleen] We bring out 
the sleeping bags

1080
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:02,361
and we bring out warmer clothes
to spend the night here.

1081
01:11:04,129 --> 01:11:07,086
9/11 families have always been 
somewhat out in the public but

1082
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:11,256
this was taking a step where people 
could really be critical of you saying

1083
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:14,153
that you had flipped your lid, you know.

1084
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:15,578
And you know, you could feel that.

1085
01:11:15,578 --> 01:11:18,850
You could feel that,
"Maybe, I'm so deep into this.

1086
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,527
Maybe, I'm carrying it too far."

1087
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:27,710
But the first nights down there,
I knew that it was the right thing to do.

1088
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:35,999
<i>We looked out into the vast openness</i>
and we could just say

1089
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:37,733
<i>this was their spot</i>

1090
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,817
<i>and we're defending it.</i>

1091
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:49,328
<i>- [Reporter] They're being touted</i>
as the last pieces

1092
01:11:49,328 --> 01:11:51,242
<i>in the rebirth of Lower Manhattan.</i>

1093
01:11:51,242 --> 01:11:56,131
<i>The three towers: 2, 3 and 4 will replace</i>
about 6 million square feet

1094
01:11:56,131 --> 01:11:58,397
<i>of the 10 million destroyed in the attack.</i>

1095
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:01,768
<i>Norman Foster's tower is the largest</i>
of the three buildings.

1096
01:12:01,768 --> 01:12:03,992
<i>It's taller than the Empire State Building</i>

1097
01:12:03,992 --> 01:12:06,483
<i>and has diamond-like paneling</i>
along the top.

1098
01:12:06,483 --> 01:12:09,424
<i>Richard Roger's tower</i>
is far sleeker in design.

1099
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:11,787
<i>Fumihiko Maki's is the first to be built,</i>

1100
01:12:11,787 --> 01:12:13,900
<i>will have a restaurant</i>
with panoramic views.

1101
01:12:14,423 --> 01:12:16,400
- [Silverstein] Good morning.
- [speaker] Mr. Damian, you know.

1102
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,475
- Hello, Damian.
- [Damian] Hi.

1103
01:12:17,475 --> 01:12:20,569
- HI, buddy. How are you?
Okay.

1104
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,331
- [speaker] We're in deep discussion
with the Board

1105
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:25,324
and the transit authority's
about that.

1106
01:12:25,324 --> 01:12:29,174
- [Silverstein] We have less congestion
by pulling this in

1107
01:12:29,174 --> 01:12:31,163
and having these out here.

1108
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:36,331
All during this time, we're plowing ahead,
plowing ahead.

1109
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:39,450
Because we have--Governor said
we design, finish plans,

1110
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,666
specification and so forth 
for Towers 2, 3 and 4.

1111
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:45,646
We did them, 18 months we finished
the plans, specifications, done.

1112
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:48,139
All right. Ready to go.
Ready to shovel the ground.

1113
01:12:48,139 --> 01:12:51,395
Is this width the same
as this width?

1114
01:12:51,395 --> 01:12:55,306
And guess what?
No ground on which to put a shovel.

1115
01:12:55,306 --> 01:12:57,330
Why? Because the sites aren't ready.

1116
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:59,201
The sites the Port Authority's 
suppose to deliver to us.

1117
01:12:59,201 --> 01:13:00,549
Not ready.

1118
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:02,843
<i>We know what it takes to dig a hole.</i>

1119
01:13:02,843 --> 01:13:05,487
<i>But for some reason, your people,</i>
they're taking longer.

1120
01:13:05,487 --> 01:13:08,877
Much longer than it has
ever been taken, right?

1121
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:10,420
What's taking so long?

1122
01:13:12,898 --> 01:13:15,728
<i>- [Lieber] What happened was they had</i>
another groundbreaking.

1123
01:13:16,866 --> 01:13:21,313
And they started construction of
this PATH Train Station,

1124
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,715
<i>designed by Santiago Calatrava.</i>

1125
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,144
<i>- [Pataki] And I remember</i>
the Port Authority had,

1126
01:13:28,144 --> 01:13:30,310
<i>going to Santiago and saying,</i>

1127
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:34,344
"Is it expensive?" and he said,
"Of course, it is."

1128
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:41,809
<i>- [Raab] Okay, build me the world's</i>
most expensive subway stop.

1129
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:46,666
Two billion dollar?
No, make it $4 billion.
The wings are going to open

1130
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:50,625
like a dove twice a year
or maybe not.

1131
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:55,440
<i>- [Lieber] And what increasingly</i>
became clear is that this train station,

1132
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,591
which they called, "The Oculus,"
because of its shape,

1133
01:13:58,591 --> 01:14:02,817
was actually an octopus that was
killing all the other projects around it

1134
01:14:02,817 --> 01:14:06,358
<i>because they were sticking</i>
all their mechanical system,

1135
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:09,612
<i>their air condition, their heating,</i>
to support this train station,

1136
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,688
<i>were being pushed into other buildings.</i>

1137
01:14:12,688 --> 01:14:15,566
<i>It was creating all kinds</i>
of complexities and delays.

1138
01:14:17,734 --> 01:14:19,787
2008

1139
01:14:19,987 --> 01:14:23,434
<i>- [David Paterson] In my perusal, just</i>
in the first days of my administration,

1140
01:14:23,434 --> 01:14:28,797
I couldn't really find anyone that
knew what was being built,

1141
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:31,885
who was building it,
when it would be completed

1142
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:36,880
and how and what fashion
it would actually be erected.

1143
01:14:39,702 --> 01:14:42,086
- [worker] Wonderful time.
- [Chris Ward] Sir. Good.

1144
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:46,820
<i>- [Lieber] And one of the first things</i>
that Paterson did when he came in,

1145
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:51,310
<i>was to replace the head</i>
of the Port Authority

1146
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,366
<i>with a new guy named, Chris Ward.</i>

1147
01:14:54,499 --> 01:14:56,608
- [Ward] It's great they're all tied off.

1148
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:03,192
We wanted it to be symbolic.

1149
01:15:03,192 --> 01:15:05,634
We wanted it to be monumental.

1150
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:09,372
That could've and should've
remained at a certain level,

1151
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:12,330
but it became to dominate
the whole project literally

1152
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:16,502
right down into the ground and when 
it dominated it down into the ground,

1153
01:15:16,502 --> 01:15:22,802
the project lost its logic,
it lost its constructability.

1154
01:15:22,802 --> 01:15:25,339
- [Raab] Chris Ward's a guy who's
smart enough to come into the office

1155
01:15:25,339 --> 01:15:27,694
and recognize that 
everyone had been lying.

1156
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:30,377
Everyone had been 
bullshitting for years.

1157
01:15:30,377 --> 01:15:32,849
Everyone had held press conferences,
and made promises,

1158
01:15:32,849 --> 01:15:36,896
and none of those press conferences
meant a goddamn thing

1159
01:15:36,896 --> 01:15:38,945
and none of those promises 
could be kept.

1160
01:15:38,945 --> 01:15:41,489
- [Paterson] After looking at the
construction solutions,

1161
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:45,404
that Chris Ward and the staff of
the Port Authority

1162
01:15:45,404 --> 01:15:50,955
have been able to establish,
I am comfortable today

1163
01:15:50,955 --> 01:15:54,633
by telling you that on 
September 11th, 2011,

1164
01:15:54,633 --> 01:16:00,670
ten years to the date of that disaster,
there will be an open memorial

1165
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:03,805
at Ground Zero to those
who lost their lives that day.

1166
01:16:04,745 --> 01:16:08,438
<i>- [Ward] We made a major commitment</i>
that the plaza would be open

1167
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,658
<i>on the ten-year anniversary.</i>

1168
01:16:10,658 --> 01:16:13,115
<i>The fountains would be functioning,</i>
the water would fall

1169
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:15,924
<i>and that was the commitment we made.</i>

1170
01:16:15,924 --> 01:16:21,180
But it was a lot more complicated
and there was some real fundamental

1171
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:26,674
disconnects in what had to get built
and how it would get built

1172
01:16:26,674 --> 01:16:30,778
and who would build it, that had
to really get completely sorted out.

1173
01:16:30,778 --> 01:16:34,250
- [Silverstein] Things were sliding
further and further and further behind

1174
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:37,507
as we progressed, right? As the days 
went by, the days, the months.

1175
01:16:38,968 --> 01:16:43,157
<i>- [Ward] The Mayor, advocate for the city,</i>
saw that things were in fact, stalled,

1176
01:16:43,157 --> 01:16:47,183
took it upon himself to bring us 
together in a Gracie Mansion Summit.

1177
01:16:47,398 --> 01:16:50,841
<i>He brought the Governors together</i>
from both States.

1178
01:16:50,841 --> 01:16:53,633
<i>He brought Larry and he brought me there.</i>

1179
01:16:54,586 --> 01:16:57,320
- [Bloomberg] When they're not
making progress, just shake things up.

1180
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,646
You put them in a room with a 
big pot of coffee

1181
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:02,889
and lock the doors with no bathroom.
You'd be surprised how quickly

1182
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:04,229
they come to an agreement.

1183
01:17:05,543 --> 01:17:07,710
<i>- [Ward] It was one of those moments</i>
that I'm sure the Mayor

1184
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:10,350
<i>was very, very disappointed,</i>
if you go to Gracie Mansion,

1185
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:13,368
<i>the whole idea is you have success</i>
when you leave.

1186
01:17:13,368 --> 01:17:16,435
But you couldn't on that day, 
solve all the problems

1187
01:17:16,435 --> 01:17:18,649
as the Mayor had hoped we would.

1188
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:24,993
- [Lieber] At some point, you know,
the anger gives way to just depression

1189
01:17:24,993 --> 01:17:27,925
because you think, "How are we gonna
ever get out of this?"

1190
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:31,771
[crowd cheering and applauding]

1191
01:17:32,048 --> 01:17:34,264
- [speaker] Let me hear you 
one more time.

1192
01:17:34,264 --> 01:17:36,599
Wouldn't we want these jobs?
[crowd shouting] No!

1193
01:17:36,599 --> 01:17:39,451
Wouldn't we want these jobs?
[crowd shouting] No!

1194
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:42,990
<i>- [speaker] The finger pointing</i>
has got to stop.

1195
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:48,334
That's almost nine years after 9/11,
instead of a shiny symbol of

1196
01:17:48,334 --> 01:17:52,786
American resilience and strength,
we have a hole in the ground.

1197
01:17:52,786 --> 01:17:55,381
[cheering and applause]

1198
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:59,627
<i>- [Lieber] The construction workers</i>
in New York were so out of work.

1199
01:17:59,627 --> 01:18:03,947
<i>At this point, this six months</i>
after Lehman Brothers went down

1200
01:18:03,947 --> 01:18:07,815
<i>and we're in the middle</i>
of this incredible economic collapse.

1201
01:18:07,815 --> 01:18:11,459
- [Ward] And you could take a 
pessimistic view and go,

1202
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:15,215
<i>"You know, maybe this worldwide recession</i>
is gonna be deep.

1203
01:18:15,215 --> 01:18:18,715
<i>It's gonna be long and that we're not</i>
gonna come out of it quickly."

1204
01:18:18,715 --> 01:18:21,620
<i>We had a study that said,</i>
"Maybe the market's not back

1205
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:24,253
all the way until 2037.

1206
01:18:24,253 --> 01:18:30,480
- [Lieber] People were not down for
waiting another 25 years

1207
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,687
to get the World Trade Center rebuilt.

1208
01:18:33,687 --> 01:18:36,431
[crowd chanting] Build it now!
Build it now!

1209
01:18:36,431 --> 01:18:39,779
Build it now!
Build it now!

1210
01:18:39,779 --> 01:18:44,853
- [Ward] It was kind of a great moment
because everybody's chanting,

1211
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:48,937
<i> "Build it now!" And I was like,</i>
"Who are they talking to?"

1212
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:54,200
They were talking to me because 
I was the one guy who was there

1213
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,847
that would answer the question,
"Could you build it now?"

1214
01:18:56,847 --> 01:19:00,772
<i>They were convinced that we were</i>
the ones who were slowing it down.

1215
01:19:01,386 --> 01:19:09,659
- [speaker] We need the Hirsch, Chris,
Larry, the city, to get back at the table

1216
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:14,505
to find a solution so that these 
two towers can be built

1217
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:17,386
and they can be built now.

1218
01:19:17,614 --> 01:19:21,595
- [Lieber] No more excuses. It's time 
for us to all put our shoulders

1219
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:24,119
so that we all work together
to get the job done.

1220
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:26,663
And I think that was a game changer.

1221
01:19:27,331 --> 01:19:29,302
- [Paterson] And today, we have found
an agreement

1222
01:19:29,302 --> 01:19:35,130
that we feel will allow us 
to complete the reconstruction

1223
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:37,676
of the World Trade Center's site.

1224
01:19:40,044 --> 01:19:43,226
- [Ward] Wow. This is progress.

1225
01:19:44,195 --> 01:19:48,363
This is probably the most important
part of the project from the

1226
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:52,999
Port Authority's commitment to
deliver the plaza for the anniversary.

1227
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:56,961
We have to have this done or
the plaza will not be completed.

1228
01:19:56,961 --> 01:19:58,942
But you stand here and think,

1229
01:19:58,942 --> 01:20:01,650
"Are they gonna be able 
to get it all done?"

1230
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:09,634
We're doing really well. I have no 
expectation that we won't deliver

1231
01:20:09,634 --> 01:20:13,894
but, imagine it if we don't?

1232
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:37,509
- [Jim] What's up, V.?
- [V.] How's it going, Jim?

1233
01:20:37,509 --> 01:20:38,526
How are you, buddy?

1234
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:40,894
- [worker] I got it right here.

1235
01:20:40,894 --> 01:20:44,207
The one coming through 
from this way here is sided.

1236
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:46,200
- [Jim] Okay, all right.

1237
01:20:46,938 --> 01:20:49,803
[crackling metal sound]

1238
01:20:56,527 --> 01:20:59,941
I gotta get all the way out to the street
five feet by today, alright?

1239
01:21:00,462 --> 01:21:03,515
Bob, we need those two
beehive strainers.

1240
01:21:06,468 --> 01:21:08,111
When you look at it like this,

1241
01:21:08,111 --> 01:21:11,620
it's just amazing how many 
people killed that day.

1242
01:21:14,235 --> 01:21:17,570
Well, I lost my mother on 9/11.
She was on the 94th floor

1243
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:21,567
of the North Tower. 
I don't know what to say.

1244
01:21:21,567 --> 01:21:26,460
That's just hard to imagine
it's ten years already. It really is.

1245
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:29,945
It's what we have right here.

1246
01:21:48,344 --> 01:21:50,628
- [Arad] Reading the names
up to the plaza,

1247
01:21:50,628 --> 01:21:53,650
when that decision was made
against my wishes,

1248
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:56,600
it felt like a tremendous blow.

1249
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:04,504
And you know-- but if it is a child,
if it is your child and it's injured,

1250
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:09,323
you don't walk away from it,
you stay involved. You keep caring.

1251
01:22:15,091 --> 01:22:19,647
My hope is when the memorial opens up,
whatever dissatisfaction's had been

1252
01:22:19,647 --> 01:22:23,175
expressed up until now, some of this
here's might be assuaged.

1253
01:22:24,882 --> 01:22:28,400
We'll see, I mean that's the missing 
ingredient for the memorial right now,

1254
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,430
it's that interaction between 
the public and the memorial.

1255
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:39,700
And what you have right now is 
the stage that's set for that encounter.

1256
01:22:41,747 --> 01:22:45,234
SEPTEMBER 11, 2011

1257
01:22:47,059 --> 01:22:49,523
[crickets chirping]

1258
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,924
Bye, sweetie. I'm leaving now.

1259
01:22:54,486 --> 01:22:58,069
[door opens
then closes]

1260
01:23:00,546 --> 01:23:06,323
<i>You know, last night at 11:00 or so,</i>
all of a sudden I sort of had this urge to

1261
01:23:06,323 --> 01:23:09,712
<i>jump in the car and drive to see the site</i>
to make sure that everything's there.

1262
01:23:11,204 --> 01:23:13,186
You know, sort of last minute--

1263
01:23:16,678 --> 01:23:19,372
You wanna make sure 
everything is just right.

1264
01:23:23,969 --> 01:23:25,975
[Sean giggling]

1265
01:23:25,975 --> 01:23:28,658
- [Sean] Ahh...

1266
01:23:30,042 --> 01:23:31,503
- [Rosaleen] Sean?

1267
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:34,815
[scraping sound]

1268
01:23:36,055 --> 01:23:39,890
You put on Uncle Sean's shirt?
You can put on Uncle Sean's shirt.

1269
01:23:47,488 --> 01:23:50,820
<i>- [Arad] Today's gonna be</i>
really difficult.

1270
01:23:51,398 --> 01:23:53,224
<i>But it's the moment I've been waiting for.</i>

1271
01:23:55,121 --> 01:23:57,849
<i>- [Judey] I want that one, please.</i>

1272
01:23:57,849 --> 01:23:59,396
<i>- [Rosaleen] Please have</i>
a couple of bites, Sean.

1273
01:23:59,396 --> 01:24:02,347
I'll give Panny then, a little bit 
of your English muffin.

1274
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:04,540
- [Sean] They had a truck in those 
bunks in the truck

1275
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,828
and they move it into the garage.

1276
01:24:06,828 --> 01:24:09,291
- [Rosaleen] You know, Daddy went 
over there to see

1277
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:11,573
if he could find Uncle Sean. 
I don't know if you ever knew that.

1278
01:24:11,573 --> 01:24:13,276
- [Judey] He did?

1279
01:24:13,276 --> 01:24:14,752
- [Rob Tallon] Yeah.
- I never knew that.

1280
01:24:16,107 --> 01:24:18,662
<i>- [Rosaleen] It would be nice</i>
to see Uncle Sean's name, right?

1281
01:24:18,662 --> 01:24:20,084
- [Judey] Yeah.

1282
01:24:40,084 --> 01:24:40,983
- [Silverstein] Thank you.

1283
01:24:40,983 --> 01:24:41,899
[car door closes]

1284
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:01,700
<i>- [Rosaleen] Guys,</i>
ain't it a beautiful day?

1285
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,163
<i>- [Eileen] Oh, yes.</i>
- They had predicted rain for

1286
01:25:03,163 --> 01:25:05,194
yesterday and today.

1287
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:14,568
<i>- [Silverstein] Go on,</i>
just go pass them slowly.

1288
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:17,006
Go further.

1289
01:25:17,006 --> 01:25:21,549
You're gonna go straight to Denmar.

1290
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,303
<i>- [woman] Good morning.</i>
- [driver] Good morning, ma'am.

1291
01:25:23,303 --> 01:25:25,485
- <i>How are you?</i>
- [Silverstein] Silverstein!

1292
01:25:25,485 --> 01:25:27,150
<i>- Straight ahead, Sir.</i>
- Thank you.

1293
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:28,065
<i>- Okay. - [driver] Thank you. </i>

1294
01:25:28,065 --> 01:25:29,235
<i>- Have a great day.- Likewise, ma'am.</i>

1295
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:38,647
- [Eileen] He was just beaming that
morning. He was all lit up

1296
01:25:38,647 --> 01:25:44,285
in the house, had such a smile.
He was wearing his lovely shirt

01:26:03,979 --> 01:26:05,767
- [Rosaleen] Yes, they are very charming.

1299
01:26:07,975 --> 01:26:10,223
Where's Grandma?
Keep Grandma with us.

1300
01:26:10,223 --> 01:26:12,178
- [Judey] Can you release my hand.

1309
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:31,664
- [Arad] It's easy to think about all the
strife, all the disagreement,

1310
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:35,607
<i>to sort of focus on, "Well, you know, this</i>
didn't go right, that didn't go right."

1311
01:27:35,607 --> 01:27:39,049
<i>Actually, the big picture is something</i>
went right, really right.

1312
01:27:55,102 --> 01:27:58,149
- [Silverstein] At the end of the day, 
it's a good thing to see,

1313
01:27:58,149 --> 01:28:01,232
everything out moving down the track

1314
01:28:01,232 --> 01:28:04,996
and getting built because
this is important to New York.

1315
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:10,340
You have to develop very thick skin,

1316
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:13,461
really take a long view,
a very long view.

1317
01:28:15,454 --> 01:28:17,679
And praises? White noise.

1318
01:28:31,309 --> 01:28:33,290
<i>- [Rosaleen] That's Sean's name.</i>

1319
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:37,223
I mean, he's one of these people 
listed on this memorial.

1320
01:28:37,223 --> 01:28:40,102
That's the shocker, I think.
You know, you say,

1321
01:28:40,102 --> 01:28:44,960
"God, that was my flesh and blood
that got caught up in all of this."

1322
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:52,464
<i>- [Lieber] I don't know if the city</i>
will ever be whole.

1323
01:28:52,464 --> 01:28:55,751
<i>The people who are lost,</i>
the families who experienced that.

1324
01:28:55,751 --> 01:29:03,673
<i>You can never put that back or replace,</i>
but there's a part of the city's

1325
01:29:03,673 --> 01:29:05,613
<i>self respect that I think</i>
is gonna be restored.

1326
01:29:08,596 --> 01:29:11,266
<i>- [Childs] This is not Rome,</i>
in which you wanna hold it as it now is,

1327
01:29:11,266 --> 01:29:13,844
<i>as a great historic monument,</i>

1328
01:29:13,844 --> 01:29:15,392
<i>but something which evolves and changes.</i>

1329
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:17,224
<i> That's the nature of New York.</i>

1330
01:29:23,547 --> 01:29:27,172
<i>- [Philip] It's an incredibly</i>
healthy thing that the city responded

1331
01:29:27,172 --> 01:29:30,963
<i>to September 11th in sort of,</i>
classic New York fashion

1332
01:29:30,963 --> 01:29:35,190
<i>by beating each other up and</i>
grandstanding in political manipulation

1333
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:38,281
<i>and you can say, "Oh, that's awful."</i>

1334
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:42,118
<i>Or you can say, "What a wonderful thing</i>
that New York

1335
01:29:42,118 --> 01:29:44,910
<i>healed this big wound with more New York."</i>

1336
01:29:56,152 --> 01:29:59,140
Citing marketing concerns,
the Port Authority renamed

1337
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,929
the "Freedom Tower"
1 World Trade Center.

1338
01:30:02,083 --> 01:30:05,204
Soon after, the agency signed
a lease for 1 million square feet

1339
01:30:05,204 --> 01:30:08,756
of office space with magazine
publisher Condé Nast.

1340
01:30:09,387 --> 01:30:13,179
The building will be the tallest
in the city and is expected

1341
01:30:13,179 --> 01:30:16,121
to open in 2014, ten years after
the cornerstone ceremony.

1342
01:30:16,549 --> 01:30:20,334
Chris Ward was pushed out
of his job at the Port Authority

1343
01:30:20,334 --> 01:30:24,058
and replaced by a top aide
to Governor Andrew Cuomo.

1344
01:30:24,511 --> 01:30:29,715
7 World Trade Center reached
full occupancy in October 2011.

1345
01:30:30,869 --> 01:30:34,915
Larry Silverstein hopes to complete
the World Trade Center project

1346
01:30:34,915 --> 01:30:37,954
by 2016, when he'll be 85 years old.

1347
01:30:38,277 --> 01:30:41,929
4 WTC will be the first tower
to open on the site in 2013.

1348
01:30:42,514 --> 01:30:45,717
The completion dates for 2 and 3 WTC
depend on the success of

1349
01:30:45,717 --> 01:30:47,747
Silverstein's leasing efforts.

1350
01:30:47,939 --> 01:30:50,956
Since winning the master-plan 
competition in 2003, Daniel Libeskind

1351
01:30:50,956 --> 01:30:53,807
has designed more than 40 projects
around the world,

1352
01:30:53,807 --> 01:30:56,951
including several skyscrapers.

1353
01:30:57,330 --> 01:31:01,433
The cornerstone now rests
behind the headquarters of the

1354
01:31:01,433 --> 01:31:05,983
company that engraved it,
in Hauppauge, Long Island.
