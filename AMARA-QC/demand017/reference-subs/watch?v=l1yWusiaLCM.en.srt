Chet Rong here with the Rong way to do Agile.

Today, requirements.

4
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:13,571
You should write specifications for all development projects.

5
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,761
The more detail, the better.

6
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:18,490
Start with a marketing requirements document.

And a product requirements document.

<i>Now, you are finally ready to start writing your stories.</i>

13
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:33,108
And remember, if your story doesn't fit on a single card,

14
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:35,904
Then it is too short, so keep writing.

15
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:39,129
Don't be afraid to add an amendment if needed.

16
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:41,361
And once everything is written down,

17
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:42,914
then there is no confusion.

- It says in 8.1.2.5.17 of the PRD

19
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:47,623
that it's supposed to have a hover state.

20
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:49,300
- How did I miss that?

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,583
- And most importantly, don't start coding until everyone is signed off

22
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,598
on specifications.

23
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:55,371
- Ugh!

25
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,919
- That's the wrong way to do requirements.
