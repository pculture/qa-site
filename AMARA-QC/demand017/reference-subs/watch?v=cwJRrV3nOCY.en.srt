00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:08,664
(Cara) Hello everyone, and welcome to the latest Smart Company webinar.

2
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:12,858
Communicating with your staff is the topic today.

3
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:19,736
My name's Cara Waters, I'm the editor of Smart Company and today I'm joined online

4
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:25,411
by Ailsa Page who owns A and P Marketing Works, a small business.

5
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:30,175
So she'll be able to give some insights into how she communicates with her staff.

6
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:37,186
And we've got Emily Jaksch who is the lady behind HR Gurus.

7
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:42,443
And she'll also be giving us some information but specifically from the

8
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:47,851
expert point of view of human resources.

9
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:52,390
So what you need to do today to participate is, firstly, just sit back

10
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,562
and listen. Audio is going to be automatically

11
00:00:55,562 --> 00:01:02,264
streamed through your computer speakers. And you can also participate through

12
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:06,880
Twitter. if you @ Smart Company, and use the

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,990
hashtag talktostaff. Finally and probably the main way the

14
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,661
most of you will participate is asking questions by the questions panel.

15
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:23,314
To do that, you just type in your questions in the space at the bottom and

16
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:28,639
click on Send. I'll then be, putting the questions to.

17
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:38,090
the presenters from you so on your behalf so, do feel free to fire away its a great

18
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,262
opportunity to have some experts on line here.

19
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:48,630
And, ask them what you want. Alright and finally don't worry about

20
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,817
hurriedly scribbling things down. Because if you miss something, you will

21
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:57,590
be sent a copy of the slides and a link to the webinar recording tomorrow

22
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,912
afternoon. And so we'll have all that information

23
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:05,527
for you. And just before we get going, a big thank

24
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:09,649
you to our partner for today's webinar, Business Victoria.

25
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:15,257
as you can see, they're on Twitter and Facebook as well if you want to follow

26
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:17,830
along. Great.

27
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:24,004
So, now I'm going to hand over to our presenters, for our webinar,

28
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:28,463
Communicating with Staff. So, take it away, Emily and Ailsa.

29
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:33,464
(Emily) Thanks, Cara, Well, today we're talking about, as she

30
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:37,381
mentioned, communicating with staff. My name's Emily Jaksch.

31
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:41,280
And I'll be joined by Ailsa Page, who will be giving me some insights

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,736
from a small business perspective.

33
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:52,046
We've got quite a bit to get through. So, as you would know from the content that

34
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:56,520
we're going to cover today we're looking at how to set up processes so communication doesn't get lost.

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,309
Communication around those tricky topics that you probably try to avoid at all costs,

36
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:05,154
getting key messages across during staff inductions.

37
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:11,715
The best way to communicate to develop loyalty and build teams; how to let your staff know if they are not

38
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:15,591
performing and how to praise them when they are.

39
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:19,861
How to communicate change and the importance of face to face communication. Okay.

40
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:26,465
So the first topic we're going to talk about is effective communication process, in that it is

41
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:31,179
really important that you setup both formal and informal communication processes.

42
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:36,012
The first one is really just having a business plan and making it visible to your staff

43
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:40,982
So you could have scorecards. I've got clients who had visual

44
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:45,392
boards on their wall so everybody know exactly what's expected of them on a day

45
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,809
to day basis and where the company is heading.

46
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:52,130
And next thing is a really simple one, it's around having a job description

47
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,159
and making sure they're kept up to date, and this is around making sure

48
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:01,363
people know what's expected of them and what their job is. The next one is having an induction and

49
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:09,464
formal training for your staff also very important and finally having a performance review process.

50
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:14,306
I guess informally, staff meetings

51
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:16,388
which lots of people probably don't do enough of

52
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:22,101
or if they do they are probably not as conducive as they would like them to be

53
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:24,602
so it's really important to use staff meetings

54
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:30,562
that have an agenda. Staff announcements via email verbally it's

55
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,130
really important that people are aware of what's going on.

56
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,898
One on one coaching sessions are also really important around communication, people want to know

57
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:44,130
feedback around their performance. And finally, using social media, you

58
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,130
know, the internal internet, is a great way to publish communication and

59
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:54,824
make sure that it's not lost. I guess the key purpose of all of this is making sure people understand

60
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:58,985
what's expected of them, what's happening in the business

61
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,981
and finally what's going to be rewarded.

62
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:06,635
And I guess I'd like to ask Ailsa what she thinks of all these

63
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:09,130
different communication processes or what works best

64
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,905
for you in your business.

65
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:13,161
(Ailsa) Great. Well, look hello everyone.

66
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:15,666
it's great to be here. Now just to, yeah,

67
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:21,028
I, look, I think it is important to communicate at different levels with your

68
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:23,808
staff. Some people are very verbal, obviously.

69
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:25,892
Other people like to see things written down.

70
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,179
And I think the most important thing is to make sure that whatever's it's in the

71
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:32,602
job description is actually then, also, that you've got a

72
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:37,130
consistency of communication as well. But I think it depends on the size of the

73
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,213
business. If you've got lots of people, then you

74
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,880
probably will have a bit more written documentation.

75
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,965
If you've only got, sort of, a couple of staff or maybe some part time staff,

76
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:50,299
it obviously will be a little bit more on the informal side of things.

77
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:55,016
But I think it's good to have both, because, if you just have things that are

78
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:59,714
informal, then, I think a little bit can perhaps sometimes it's not as taken as

79
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:02,001
seriously as stuff that's written down.

80
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:06,693
So, one of the things I certainly do with my staff

81
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:08,172
is I do have things written down,

82
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:10,047
and then on a regular basis,

83
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:13,047
I'll check in with them, to see, to let them know what's been happening with the,

84
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:17,379
with the business, what are some updates, and also just to reiterate again,

85
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,147
particularly for, say, this week, what might be the priorities for this week.

86
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:25,063
(Emily) Fantastic. That's great advice.

87
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:30,564
So, I just want to refer to the Business Victoria website.

88
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:33,384
There's an enormous amount of great content on the site.

89
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:35,465
So, you don't have to create these things from scratch

90
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:39,556
I know that is seems a bit scary, but they've got business planning templates,

91
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:45,056
they've got job description templates, they've got advice on induction and

92
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,630
training. They've also got a performance review

93
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,266
process on there with some advice about creating KPI's in your business.

94
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:55,672
So please refer back to that. because it will definitely help you if

95
00:06:55,672 --> 00:07:01,314
you are starting from scratch. Okay, so another thing that we wanted to

96
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:03,963
talk about today is effective induction processes.

97
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:09,919
So, I cannot stress enough the importance of that first day induction.

98
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,323
Research tells us that the, the key reason that people leave within the first

99
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:18,670
three months is a lack of induction. There's nothing worse than rocking up on your first

100
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,047
day. And finding that you don't have a desk,

101
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:24,266
you don't have a computer, and no one wants to spend any time with you.

102
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:28,547
So making sure that you're ready for that person on that first day is really,

103
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:31,797
really important. You need to make them feel welcome.

104
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:37,047
You need to introduce them to everybody. You need to also go through the terms and

105
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:40,714
conditions of their employment, your policies, and a really good way to do

106
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:44,690
that is using a staff handbook. There is actually a great template available on

107
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:51,385
the Business Victoria website if you don't have one which has the basic policies that any small

108
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:55,865
business would need. Following on from that the first week is also

109
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:59,428
really important. This is where you really need to provide that on the

110
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:04,436
job training to ensure that people know exactly what's expected of them and if you don't

111
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:09,657
have time to do it a really great tip is to use a buddy so allocate that

112
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:13,816
person an individual. So that you can ensure that you're

113
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:17,726
controlling exactly what that person needs to know to ensure they can do their

114
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:21,082
job. Finally, another recommendation to make

115
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:24,797
sure your induction is really successful is to have follow up

116
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:28,167
in place for 30, 60 and 90 days. So, that means holding a review with the

117
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:33,066
person, checking in to see how they're going,

118
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:37,759
and then finally the most important thing is ensuring that you communicate with

119
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,965
that person whether or not they've completed their induction or not.

120
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:44,714
Sorry, their probation. A lot of businesses forget to do that.

121
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:51,371
Whether its in a letter whether you sit them down and say congratulations your position is now permanent,

122
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:57,153
it's just about keeping those communication lines open in the first 3 months of employment.

123
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:07,980
So, Ailsa as a small business owner how, important do you think induction is. (Ailsa)Sorry I just jumped in there [LAUGH].

124
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,999
What I was going to say that is that look induction is everything because it really

125
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:16,901
is the first impression. And as we know first impressions count so

126
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:20,322
I 100% agree with what you're saying about being organized really, really

127
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:21,659
important. If you're not,

128
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:25,085
you know, if you don't at least give the impression of organization on the first

129
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:29,105
day, sometimes that can unsettle staff. So I think it is, its really worth taking

130
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:33,593
the time to you know have a fresh desk, have everything ready for them if

131
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:35,907
they're in the office. You know just, make sure that its all

132
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,918
there. And then I think a big one too is to

133
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:42,676
really go through all the OH&S, if things go, even if you're in a home based

134
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:46,387
business you know, that's at home. All of that thing is to show them that

135
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:49,342
you actually care about them and I think that is really important to get out there

136
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:54,457
right at the front I mean you know I know many staff have giggled when I show them

137
00:09:54,457 --> 00:10:00,027
the fire extinguisher, I just want them to know that we have it because believe it

138
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:06,979
or not we did have a fire once in the office. It was a random thing now, but it's really

139
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:09,161
important that [LAUGH] everyone knows how to use that. So, I think that's a really

140
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:11,820
a good thing. And if, you know, even if you might be

141
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,261
fairly casual in the way that you are with your staff, you need to be very

142
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:19,986
professional with your induction. You need to show that this is serious,

143
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:24,537
that it is work and talk through all those things in a very professional way.

144
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:27,042
You can still be friendly, but you need to be professional.

145
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:30,653
(Cara) That's great advice. I've just got a question

146
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:35,043
there for, the two of you really, interested to get Ailsa and Emily's

147
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:38,537
opinion. Aah, Kathrine has asked, should the staff

148
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:42,769
handbook covered the induction include all of the companies polices?

149
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:49,154
(Emily) Yes I would say that it should. It's a great time to make sure that people

150
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:55,570
know what the rules are in a workplace and I would also encourage that at the end of that get

151
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,237
them to sign something that they have read and understood all the policies and

152
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:04,456
that would help protect you later on if there are any issues.

153
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:09,822
(Ailsa) And I would agree so, yeah great.

154
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:18,597
I was going to say I would agree if you've got all of that and if you want you're going to be getting lots of staff

155
00:11:18,597 --> 00:11:20,609
particularly if you're not going to be in easy,

156
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:25,237
you know, if you're not going to be there a lot to supervise staff or just to,

157
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:28,903
or for staff to ask you questions, then I think the more you can provide to

158
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:32,351
them, so that they don't feel left out the wilderness is very important.

159
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:37,711
(Emily) Yeah I would agree. There's nothing worse then someone rocking up on their first day

160
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:40,237
and then they get shown the desk and then that's it

161
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:43,595
and they're expected to miraculously know what their job is,

162
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:47,987
the induction is about, introducing them into your business,

163
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:53,997
helping them to understand what the rules are for your business and how they're going to I guess be

164
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:59,987
measured and what, what's expected of them in a performance perspective.

165
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:06,912
It's really important that it, it's done formally, I would say.

166
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:08,741
(Cara) Great. Thanks.

167
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:15,932
(Emily) Okay. So once again I'll refer back to the Business Victoria website.

168
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,244
There's a whole section there about

169
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:23,834
induction and probation and there's a section page there for a staff handbook for a smaller business to pick up

170
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:27,642
basically putting your company name and be able to tailor it

171
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:36,913
a little bit and have a pretty workable document straight away. So I guess the big question is why

172
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:43,244
do we do this, why do we want small businesses to communicate with staff and that's easy because it is what

173
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:48,834
drives performance, because its really the way people learn through communicating,

174
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:53,191
you can tell them what you want them to start, stop, and continue.

175
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:58,337
And secondly it creates opportunity for professional and personal development

176
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:03,523
but it's really about providing that coaching to your staff to help them not only

177
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:09,755
develop their job but help them develop their career. Finally it's about

178
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:14,981
communicating appreciation, praise and credit for that persons efforts. How else do people know unless you sit

179
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:18,159
them down and give them a pat on the back.

180
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,972
It doesn't cost anything to give them a pat on the back and say thank you and I know

181
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:29,828
what it feels like if someone tells me I've done a great job it gives you a massive buck up and you go home feeling

182
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:36,245
really good about your work and that's what communication is about.

183
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:42,300
It is really about managing people well, building relationships with them, you're opening that dialogue.

184
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,461
You're improving morale, you're building teamwork and you're setting people up for success.

185
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:53,102
Then, if you're not doing it, how do your people know what you're thinking, a lot of business owners

186
00:13:53,102 --> 00:13:56,870
probably get bogged down in the day to day and sit in their office.

187
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,473
They don't spend enough time getting out there and talking with their people about

188
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:04,106
what's going on. Generally the only time that business

189
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:08,510
owners probably speak to their staff is when they have done something wrong and

190
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:15,178
they're giving them negative feedback. So once again an essential part of

191
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:23,042
engaging people on a day to day basis. So, Ailsa,

192
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:27,205
I just want to get your experience as a business owner of maybe some good and bad

193
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:30,505
communication feedback type experiences that you've had.

194
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:33,264
(Ailsa) Mm, okay. Well, I'm going to talk about some good

195
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,818
stuff first. And, and that is,

196
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:38,943
and it's actually out of, this was not so much when I was in my own

197
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,428
business. But when I was actually managing,

198
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:43,880
I was actually managing volunteers, and, you know, so this

199
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,621
is people who are working for no money [LAUGH] (Emily) Yeah.

200
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:52,065
(Ailsa) And one of the things I, I really discovered was the importance of taking

201
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:58,271
the time out to, when people arrive in the workplace to meet and greet,

202
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:02,505
say G'day, catch up with them, give them a little bit of time right at the

203
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:06,448
beginning, but that's been, a, really important

204
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:11,315
thing to do and that what I found was that then one, because I used to be

205
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:13,962
worried about all the interruptions that would happen when people constantly

206
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:16,712
you know, interrupting you. And I always found that,

207
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:21,422
if you, spent that time initially, and just check in with people then, and tell,

208
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:25,009
you know, give them clear intructions and things like that then, they're less

209
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,466
likely to come and, come back and actually, you know, interrupt.

210
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:31,345
So for me that was a really good tip, spend a lot of time first up with

211
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:32,205
people, but in terms of, you know providing

212
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:37,601
feedback, look I found that generally, when

213
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:42,029
you provide some negative feedback [LAUGH] it can be challenging to you, but

214
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,220
one of the good examples was when, clearly,

215
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,393
you know, someone takes on board what you're saying and improves and then

216
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:51,495
actually, you know, is able to then go on and do,

217
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:55,446
work even better in, in the role that they had.

218
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:59,892
So obviously that's a good one. A bad experience perhaps was with one of

219
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:03,130
the staff that I had, and it was, look, I think the bottom line was I probably

220
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,308
recruited badly, and that was my, my issue there.

221
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:11,103
So really, the person didn't really have the skills required for the job that we

222
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:17,450
were, that I was employing them to do. And it was, it did end in tears.

223
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,976
Which I think is every small business owners nightmare.

224
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:25,206
When, you know, the last thing you want to do is upset someone.

225
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:29,649
But I think the bottom line was the realization that,

226
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,355
about the lack of matching of the person to the job.

227
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:37,938
And it was, and it was very upsetting for the person who was employed.

228
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,664
And it was upsetting for me, too. So that was, you know,

229
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,769
that wasn't great. But then you just, you know,

230
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,639
you work through that. You, you accept that for some-,

231
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,786
sometimes, you know, with those hard conversations

232
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,872
they're certainly not easy. I mean, it's like,

233
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:51,197
It's like a relationship breakdown. You know, they're not easy to have but,

234
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:53,914
sometimes you need to have them. &gt;&gt; (Emily) Sure.

235
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:56,837
So, how do you approach that situation with that staff or what did you actually

236
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:58,815
do? &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Which one?

237
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:00,718
The teary one? &gt;&gt; (Emily) Yeah.

238
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:04,703
&gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Well, I was really honest. I basically just you know, sat them down.

239
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:05,939
&gt;&gt; (Emily) Mm hm.

240
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,200
&gt;&gt; (Ailsa) I always think a cup of tea is always a great thing to have on hand

241
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,613
&gt;&gt; (Emily) Yep. &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) For both people and you know, and

242
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:17,400
just spoke very straight and just sort explained that

243
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,853
look, this is sort of the expectations of the job,

244
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:25,189
this is what I was expecting, this is you know perhaps this is, the performance

245
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,717
isn't really measuring up to the expectations.

246
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:33,406
I, and then I asked a staff member what they thought and, you know, they

247
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:37,147
&gt;&gt; (Emily) Yep. &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) They agreed and I guess at that time

248
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:40,778
that was when the tears came too, and I guess it was perhaps the realization for them

249
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:43,633
that yeah, it wasn't really working out.

250
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:48,991
Yeah so then what I did, I was just then turned into a human and not a, a not, you

251
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:52,912
know, a manager and, and just sort of, you know, allowed the person to be

252
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:58,303
upset and, you know sort of sat with that really. And then, and then we sort of worked on

253
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:01,725
some more practical things of what we could do

254
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:11,104
after that. &gt;&gt; (Emily) Fantastic. And that's a really good point you mentioned that you were honest with them and that is really the key thing with feedback

255
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:20,483
and communication is that honesty and that a lot of the time honest feedback is quite hard to give and is really hard for that person to hear it

256
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:27,437
but it's the only way that people are going to learn and grow and contrary to what a lot of people

257
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:32,579
think, people actually want to hear this stuff, they want to know if they're not performing

258
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,685
and they want to know if they're doing a good job.

259
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:41,356
&gt;&gt; (Cara) Okay just to interrupt with some questions that we've got coming through

260
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:47,460
from readers or listeners Lauren has a question for Ailsa, she wants to know is

261
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,409
there ever a good way to deliver bad feedback?

262
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:55,189
&gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Oooo, good question, look, what do I think?

263
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:59,025
Is there ever a good way. Look, I think there's a good way, there's

264
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:03,152
better ways of doing it, you know, and again I think saying,

265
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:08,087
supporting what Emily said which is that, ulltimately deep down most people just

266
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:12,815
most people know the truth I actually think anyway so sometimes it can

267
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:16,624
actually be a relief to just get it out there in the open.

268
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:20,435
My feeling is you certainly, I don't like that idea of

269
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:23,958
letting someone know, oh look, we really need to have a talk, and then

270
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:27,664
leaving this enormous amount of time and stress to develop.

271
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:31,223
So for me it's about, it's about being kind of pretty clear, pretty up front

272
00:19:31,223 --> 00:19:34,854
making sure it's not about the person, but about the situation.

273
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:38,241
And, and probably just delivering it sooner rather than later.

274
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:43,003
(Cara) I think that, that's great.

275
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:49,013
Sorry just another one from Edwin, who says, I report to somebody who's very

276
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:51,337
stingy on praise and thanks. &gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

277
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:54,165
&gt;&gt; How do you in part to your boss that a simple sporadic pat on the back is

278
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:59,822
better appreciated. (Emily) I think that, they should just tell them

279
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:03,311
and say that they would like to hear more feedback from them.

280
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:07,118
And they would like some, you know, more information about how

281
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:11,384
they're going on a daily basis. I think it's totally acceptable to, to

282
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:17,274
manage us I guess because we're always doing it. (Ailsa) I mean, I would actually suggest that

283
00:20:17,274 --> 00:20:22,952
during the time that if, with the stingy manager, is when they are giving

284
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:28,809
you a, at the time they were giving you some praise, I would try, you know, at that point

285
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,017
say, you know, when you do that? That makes me feel great and I just

286
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:35,718
want to work harder for you or something along those lines.

287
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:37,739
&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] At the time if you could

288
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:41,536
if you know if, if that could be done at the time so perhaps, perhaps practice

289
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:45,628
that one keep it you know in your pocket. And when, when you know,

290
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:51,129
&gt;&gt; suddenly 'stingy' turns generous for a moment [LAUGH] and then you know bring

291
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:55,501
out that particular comment and maybe then that will, is a nice way of perhaps

292
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:59,272
letting a business owner know, oh, okay. Because what they really want is they

293
00:20:59,272 --> 00:21:01,743
want their staff to work hard for them and sometimes they don't know how to do

294
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:05,128
that. &gt;&gt; (Emily) Exactly that's, that's really good

295
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:07,950
advice Ailsa. I'll agree.

296
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,852
&gt;&gt; (Cara) Yeah, great tip, and we've got another tip, actually, from one of the

297
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:17,406
people listening in, Greg, and he suggests the sandwich method, which he

298
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,990
said is sometimes the best delivery. You say something they do good, the bad,

299
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,579
and them leave them on a high again. &gt;&gt; (Emily) Oh,

300
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:28,085
I've actually got a slide coming up in regards to sandwiching

301
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:30,490
feedback. But I might

302
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,656
talk about that about that in a minute. (Cara) Okay I'll give you one more question then

303
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:38,490
before we move on. It's a question from Roula who says how

304
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,364
do you deal with a boss who has very bad communciation skills and is constantly

305
00:21:42,364 --> 00:21:45,407
communicating confusing and contradictory messages?

306
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:51,744
(Emily) Hm, that's a really tough one. I'm sure that everyone's had a manager who has

307
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,140
done this. I've had managers in the past who have done

308
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:04,194
exactly that and I use to make sure that I regurgitated back to them to make

309
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:07,966
sure that I was completely clear on what they wanted me to do.

310
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:13,291
So, if they asked me to do something that was a bit confusing, I'd say, so what you're asking is

311
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:18,546
this and them get to further clarify. It can be quite frustrating I would

312
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:22,113
imagine. &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Can I just make a comment here and

313
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:27,115
it is interesting I mean that these sort of coming from staff and guess for the

314
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:31,989
business owners who are listening in, this is really really important because you know

315
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:37,580
your inability to communicate, affects your staff.

316
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,938
And this is why, I guess, you know, it's fantastic that you are, if you're the

317
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:44,239
business owners, are listening to this, because this is helping you to

318
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,406
communicate well with staff. And sometimes it's not necessarily

319
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:52,118
something that comes naturally, and many people in small business haven't had that

320
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:56,595
experience of managing staff, and so I would actually encourage business owners

321
00:22:56,595 --> 00:22:59,524
to, you know, get some coaching in that area.

322
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:03,410
Because otherwise the response is, you know, you, what's going to happen is

323
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,503
your staff are going to say, look, you know, I, I'm finding this really hard

324
00:23:06,503 --> 00:23:10,741
because to that particular listener or caller who's out there you know sometimes

325
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:17,489
I'd say look you had a go at trying to, work with the manager but

326
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:20,471
sometimes you know it gets too hard and, and that make's you want to go and look

327
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:22,547
for another job. And I think this is something that small

328
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:29,285
business owners need to hear. &gt;&gt; (Emily) Yeah I, I agree totally its a really

329
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:36,407
important point. &gt;&gt; (Cara) Okay, great I'll let you keep going

330
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:40,743
then. &gt;&gt; (Emily) Okay, so we were talking about the

331
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:47,165
importance of honest feedback and what we suggest with business owners is that

332
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:52,278
you provide honest feedback frequently. That you make sure that you're focused

333
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:55,840
when you're giving it to people that you don't just kind of do it in the hallway,

334
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,209
that you're really specific because, if you're specific with your people about what

335
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:04,335
they're doing right or wrong, then they'll understand very clearly what you expect

336
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:07,441
of them. Make sure that if you give them

337
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:10,614
feedback that is actionable and is in their control.

338
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:15,019
Make sure that it's balanced, that its not just all negative feedback or all

339
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,186
positive feedback, you need to give both. Make sure that you give it with

340
00:24:19,186 --> 00:24:24,157
attention and make sure that it's timely. So, there's no point saving up 12 months

341
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:29,023
of feedback and giving it to somebody in their annual performance review.

342
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:33,148
What you need to do is talk to people about things as they happen.

343
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:36,407
So, if somebody does something wrong, if somebody is late you need to talk to them

344
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:42,232
that day, you don't let it go for 2 weeks or save it up until they've been late 6

345
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:48,803
times. So now I'm going to very quickly go through some tips for

346
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:54,412
how to give staff positive feedback and praise when they're doing a great job and this doesn't come

347
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:58,854
naturally to everybody. It is something that needs to be practiced.

348
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:05,946
And sometimes, managers or business owners might feel quite strange or insincere about giving

349
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:11,338
people praise or positive feedback. You should practice and do it over and over again to make sure

350
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:14,393
you get much better at it. [LAUGH] So I've probably said this

351
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:20,504
before that be prepared, so script what you're going to say.

352
00:25:20,504 --> 00:25:26,360
Ensure that you have an agenda and that you're ready to sit down and give that person

353
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,837
your full focus. I've already just said that.

354
00:25:30,837 --> 00:25:36,023
So be generous, fair and honest in giving positive feedback don't be too over the top but

355
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:40,112
don't be stingy, it's very important to give credit where it's due.

356
00:25:40,112 --> 00:25:47,202
Be sincere, so if you're not being sincere your staff member will probably think,

357
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:50,090
what do they want. You know need to make sure that you continue to

358
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:55,520
give people praise. Um be timely, I've already talked about this,

359
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,052
it's about giving people feedback at the time of something happening not

360
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:02,406
waiting. This is really important knowing when

361
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:07,658
to speak privately and when to speak publically. Some people love being praised in public

362
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:13,740
where as other people find it quite embarrassing and they get really uncomfortable, so it's about

363
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,396
talking to people the way they want to be spoken to.

364
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:22,990
So re-enforce not only results but also behaviour, so use a balanced approach there.

365
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,753
And it's really important to explain the impact to the team and business, that they

366
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:31,200
understand the core impact of what they've done and how important it is.

367
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,323
I'm now going to talk about giving negative feedback.

368
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:43,375
Which is probably the harder one the people probably do quite badly or probably avoid doing.

369
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:47,608
So once again I cannot stress how

370
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:51,661
important it is to be prepared. Especially when giving negative feedback, it's probably even more important

371
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:56,844
that you have an agenda, that you know exactly what you're going to say sometimes it's worth practicing

372
00:26:56,844 --> 00:27:03,861
practicing on another employee. Have really clear specific

373
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:07,240
examples because the first thing a person is going to ask as well,

374
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,323
can you give me a specific example of when I've done this, and if you can give them

375
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:15,426
clear specific examples you will obviously have a lot more impact.

376
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:19,697
And we talked about sandwiching before, but I would say avoid sandwiching

377
00:27:19,697 --> 00:27:26,362
negative feedback in between 2 pieces of positive feedback, because although it might soften the blow, what it

378
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:31,367
generally does it means that the person recieving the feedback will walk away only

379
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:35,489
having heard the positive feedback, they won't actually hear that negative

380
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:39,162
feedback in the middle, and say, Oh well I'm doing a good job.

381
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:44,239
What is really important too, if you're giving negative feedback, don't try to soften

382
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:49,285
the blow, be honest, be really constructive.

383
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:55,277
So consider your language. focus on the behaviour and the issue, not

384
00:27:55,277 --> 00:27:58,238
the person, Ailsa talked about this which is really good advice. And don't make it personal.

385
00:27:58,238 --> 00:28:05,928
Make it very clearly about the behaviour. Treat the person with dignity at

386
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:08,183
all times. Some people really get off on giving

387
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:12,157
people negative feedback, you need to make sure that you, you're

388
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:17,423
doing it with respect and being respectful, so you're not making people feel

389
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:22,786
stupid the common thing that people do is ask people an entrapment question and

390
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:27,240
that means asking someone a question they know they don't know the answer to in

391
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,798
order to make them feel stupid. I would really suggest that you move away from

392
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:39,155
all the ones from using that approach. Stay in control so I would advise people

393
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:44,574
to, to not do this when you're really emotional or upset, or when the person that you're

394
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:50,533
giving the feedback to is really emotional or upset, and if that person does become upset and emotional,

395
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:53,358
you should never leave the room or run away.

396
00:28:53,358 --> 00:29:00,123
You should stay with them and you should try and steer the conversation and continue to explain

397
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:05,100
what's going on and what's expected of them, what they need to do to improve.

398
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:11,939
So if the situation needs to be escalated and you feel like you can't deal

399
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:16,240
with it yourself then I would definitely suggest to get some help and there's lots

400
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,803
of ways you can do that. I'll refer back to the content on the

401
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:23,752
Business Victoria website. There's some great templates there

402
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:27,575
and some scripts. that have been developed on some common

403
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:33,157
you know, feedback situations. A, a really common one is, if someone is,

404
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:36,839
is continuely late, there's another script there for if you are making

405
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,573
someone redundant. So, they will definitely help you

406
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:46,823
deal with the situation, but I guess from your perspective Ailsa, have I missed

407
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:51,506
anything in terms of what we need to continue giving positive and negative

408
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:54,824
feedback? &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Well sometimes the only thing I can

409
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:58,837
say is with, with the way you can also give positive feedback is

410
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:03,073
through pay raise [LAUGH] and let them know that you're giving them a pay

411
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:05,574
raise because they've done great job, you know, great work.

412
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:10,863
Now that is more looking at it perhaps on a longer period of time, some sort of

413
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:13,409
rewards. I, I actually think you know.

414
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:14,955
&gt;&gt; (Emily) Yep. &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Sometimes it's a way,

415
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:17,212
it's just another way of saying hey, actually we really appreciate you and the

416
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:19,656
work that you've done. So that might be Christmas presents, it

417
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:23,490
might be, just things like that because often, you know, staff love that.

418
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,204
And love that when they go oh, wow look what they've given me.

419
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:29,169
Or little, you know little certificates or something like that which can be

420
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:33,255
something quite thoughtful. It doesn't have to cost a fortune and it

421
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:37,454
can mean a lot to people. And the other thing I was just going to

422
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:40,384
say with the tips for giving negative feedback,

423
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,683
because everyone reacts differently to negative feedback,

424
00:30:44,683 --> 00:30:47,405
and some people are better, better at, handling it,

425
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:49,585
you know, it can be confronting for people.

426
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:54,874
Is, I just wanted to say, to allow time. To allow time, not only for the delivery

427
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:59,175
of the feedback, but also to allow time for people to process it, and react if

428
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:01,471
they need to. So, you know,

429
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:05,290
for me, it is about, also making the space conducive.

430
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,518
Not having a space where other people can walk in or whatever else, you know.

431
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:12,678
And, and when you've put in about, you know, respect the person and, and treat

432
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:16,138
them with integrity and, and dignity. And I think part of that also can be

433
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:20,193
just, just be mindful of, of where this is going to be taking place and always

434
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:24,285
have a box of tissues. (Emily) You know that's great advice.

435
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:29,924
&gt;&gt; You should always do it, do negative feedback communications in a private

436
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:35,355
place where it's, people can't see in, because if, if someone does get upset and

437
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:40,646
they're crying and everyone can see through the window that's obviously very, very awkward for people.

438
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:43,187
So that's great advice, thanks Ailsa.

439
00:31:43,187 --> 00:31:50,660
&gt;&gt; Alright. So I guess some key tips for tricky

440
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,926
communication situations, even ones that probably some small business owners try to

441
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:58,347
avoid at all costs. That's when you know, you're maybe

442
00:31:58,347 --> 00:32:02,122
having to reduce staff numbers, you might be making people redundant, there

443
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:08,858
might be some staff changes or department restructure although, if you're a small business you probably

444
00:32:08,858 --> 00:32:17,037
don't have a whole department, [LAUGH] or if it, it it's performance issues here's some key tips that we think

445
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:21,797
are really important for these communication situations and once again

446
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:25,324
it's about being prepared and having a communication plan.

447
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:30,227
So, for instance if you're making people redundant you need to think about who

448
00:32:30,227 --> 00:32:35,376
you're going to communicate with, at what stages and when.

449
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:40,290
So, having a plan to do that will alleviate a lot of anxiety around that

450
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,119
situation. So, being prepared for the hard

451
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:46,837
questions. So it's really good to sometimes sit down

452
00:32:46,837 --> 00:32:50,115
and go, okay, well, what are the really hard questions people are going to ask me

453
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:53,427
are, and having an answer prepared, and that will make you feel a lot more

454
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:58,293
comfortable going into those situations. And, once again, be honest.

455
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:02,323
Honesty is the best policy at all times. And don't tiptoe around people's

456
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:05,743
concerns. Tell them the truth.

457
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:10,848
So be open in communicating, involve your people in any decision making.

458
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:15,925
And this is very important that you involve staff in coming up with

459
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:21,110
solutions. Most of the time they are closest to the situation

460
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,883
and they'll probably have the best solutions to these problems.

461
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:30,349
So, they'll also be really much more likely to accept what's going on if they are

462
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:36,073
involved in the decision making process. So, basically, finally, we'd like

463
00:33:36,073 --> 00:33:40,363
to say be prepared for the fallout, have answers ready to allay fears, don't run

464
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:44,032
away, stay with your people and they'll respect

465
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:49,400
you even more and once again, I'll refer back to the Business Victoria website there's some great content

466
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:57,044
there around dealing with employees. So, here's a recap on everything that

467
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:59,301
we've been talking about. Communication is a key part of being in

468
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:06,496
business because people work for people and so, business owners this means you.

469
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:11,239
So, your people work for you. So, it's really about making sure that

470
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:14,322
you communicate with your people every day,

471
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:22,435
about everything, the rule of thumb here is that there's never too much communication in my book,

472
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,825
so people want to know what's going on if you don't talk to them they're going to

473
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:32,323
find out through the grapevine and if you are the one in control, they there will be a much better outcome.

474
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:40,239
&gt;&gt; Okay, so communication is directly linked to retention.

475
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:47,657
And the reason for this is, it's about engaging with your people and involving

476
00:34:47,657 --> 00:34:53,240
them in what's going on everyday, there's no use sitting in your office, and working away,

477
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,122
and not making, not engaging your people to help you take your business forward.

478
00:34:58,122 --> 00:35:04,082
So, communicating with people is obviously going to help them

479
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:08,771
understand how they fit into the bigger picture.

480
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:12,790
And so, I guess I'd like to ask all business owners, how much time you

481
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:17,092
really spend talking to your people and do you think it's enough,

482
00:35:17,092 --> 00:35:20,796
so Ailsa, how much time do you spend talking to people in your business?

483
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:26,822
(Ailsa) Well I'm going to have to be really honest here and say probably like every

484
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:31,514
business owner, I could spend more time. But partly that's because,

485
00:35:31,514 --> 00:35:39,240
there is always this conflict between the time that you spend with your staff versus the

486
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,990
time that you spend yourself working on or in your business.

487
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,034
And sometimes there's a conflict, sometimes we think oh, you know, it's,

488
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:50,739
all this time is getting away from me that I'm spending on my staff and you

489
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:54,657
feel like it's a waste of time, which is really incorrect.

490
00:35:54,657 --> 00:35:57,961
[LAUGH] So, I guess I just want to acknowledge all those business owners out

491
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:01,207
there who perhaps feel that as well, which is like ooohh, you know,

492
00:36:01,207 --> 00:36:04,989
I feel it takes up too much of my time to, to manage staff.

493
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:08,538
Look the bottom line is. It does take up time.

494
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:12,656
However, you know the time that you actually do invest and spend with your

495
00:36:12,656 --> 00:36:15,876
staff will come back in spades. The whole point of having staff is to

496
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:19,990
kind of help you get out of your business so that you can work on it rather than in

497
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,424
it. And, you know, you need to invest

498
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,842
for this to happen. And, I've certainly seen business owners

499
00:36:26,842 --> 00:36:32,627
who havent spent the time you know, that can, it means then that

500
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:36,186
often its quite inefficient, staff haven't got the direction,

501
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:39,929
and then you end up do sort of wasting a bit of money and energy on that.

502
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:42,533
So for me it is a bit of a struggle but I make sure that I,

503
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:47,120
I am organized and spend time to organize what I want the staff to do and

504
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,574
to check in to see how they're going because what I've found is if I don't do

505
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:53,607
that, it is inefficient. And so even though I feel like I'm

506
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:56,322
wasting time I'm not, it's actually an investment.

507
00:36:56,322 --> 00:37:00,875
&gt;&gt; (Emily) Yeah, and that's great advice. Talking to staff is investing in your business

508
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:06,129
and it is quite difficult at times, but it's definitely worth it in the end.

509
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:11,573
So, the next question, I guess, is, do

510
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:14,094
you really know your people, and do you take the time to listen?

511
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:16,743
So, it's not just about one way communication.

512
00:37:16,743 --> 00:37:19,952
It's about, talking to your people. Getting their input, involving them in what's

513
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:22,244
going on. It's really really important to do that.

514
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:25,628
And I think Ailsa mentioned that, in the way that you do

515
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:33,488
communicate with your staff. So, the whole purpose of communication is

516
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:36,662
to make sure that people understand what is expected of them.

517
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:41,496
And if you do all of these things and you invest the time you're going to make sure that

518
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:47,490
your people will stay with you and if they don't they going to get disengaged,

519
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,443
we've heard some stories about managers who don't talk to their staff and impact

520
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:56,738
that it has on morale. So I'm just going to talk very quickly

521
00:37:56,738 --> 00:38:01,421
about why people stay in a business. And the first reason is around empowerment

522
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:06,849
and trust and the way that you do that is through communication. The second one is around manager

523
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:14,080
relationship and loyalty becuase people work for people, so it's really important that as a manager you spend the

524
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,697
time talking to your people. Giving them feedback when they're

525
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:21,941
doing a great job or when they're not doing a great job and this will help

526
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:25,612
retention. It's about ensuring that people

527
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:31,185
understand the bigger picture and this will help engagement levels and ensuring

528
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:34,251
that people want to contribute to the success of your business and that's what

529
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:42,923
communication is all about. &gt;&gt; So better results, are underpinned

530
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:46,171
by feedback and recognition. I think that, we've made that pretty

531
00:38:46,171 --> 00:38:51,425
obvious. So it's really simple.

532
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:56,907
Please go forth and talk to your people everyday about everything.

533
00:38:56,907 --> 00:39:03,988
So, just before I summarize what we've talked about today, Ailsa, I just wanted

534
00:39:03,988 --> 00:39:08,350
to ask you is there anything that you think we missed or if you have one top tip

535
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:12,266
that you could give business owners out there about communication,

536
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:16,074
not only are you a business owner you're also a communications expert working in

537
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:21,241
marketing, what would it be? (Ailsa) OK, well I think the big one is, is not

538
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:25,275
to assume that your staff understand what you've communicated.

539
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:28,824
In other words you need to check in that there is an understanding.

540
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,470
One of the things that has sort of come up,

541
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,877
while we've been talking that I've been thinking about is, many businesses I

542
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:41,425
speak to, sometimes they, their staff are very passionate and excited and, and very

543
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:44,824
committed, but they might be putting their energies perhaps into the wrong

544
00:39:44,824 --> 00:39:48,162
areas, and so they're actually going off on a slight tangent to perhaps what

545
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:51,548
they're meant to be doing. So I think that's probably a big thing, is

546
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:55,406
really just checking in to make sure that the staff is very clear on what you

547
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:58,637
expect of them, on what you want them to be doing.

548
00:39:58,637 --> 00:40:03,183
And so then, that needs to be done on a regular basis because if it's not, you

549
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:07,660
know they can think, you know they can be working, thinking they're doing a great

550
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,836
job but it's in the wrong direction. And, and you know sometimes business

551
00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:14,927
owners don't want to always pull back the reigns but you need to and ultimately the

552
00:40:14,927 --> 00:40:18,593
staff will thank you for, for keeping them on on track

553
00:40:18,593 --> 00:40:23,495
so that you set them up to win as an employee rather than set them up to fail because they are not

554
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:26,740
doing what they are supposed to be doing. (Emily) That's great advice.

555
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:32,490
So how do you do that in your business like, do you have monthly staff meetings

556
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:36,988
or do you do it more informally? &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Look, I pretty much have a,

557
00:40:36,988 --> 00:40:40,990
my system is that, whenever staff come in,

558
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,488
because I have a lot of part time staff as opposed to full time staff,

559
00:40:44,488 --> 00:40:46,947
I really do a check in.

560
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:49,738
I actually give them, a bit of an up to date on what's been happening in the

561
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,093
business. Because I'm sure, like many other

562
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:53,753
business owners, gee, you know,

563
00:40:53,753 --> 00:40:55,868
one week in small business, a lot can happen.

564
00:40:55,868 --> 00:40:58,375
So it's a case of really bringing them up to speed.

565
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:01,474
And sometimes, you know, we do change direction, because we can.

566
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:04,262
Because we're flexible, we're small, and we are able to, you know?

567
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:07,406
You know, adapt to the market. So I, bring them up to speed.

568
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:14,135
And then, sort of relate how perhaps the changes in the business, might then affect

569
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:17,094
what they've been doing. And I, you know, reiterate exactly,

570
00:41:17,094 --> 00:41:20,950
well, you know, you were working on this. This is now no longer such a priority so

571
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,056
I'd like you to work on this. Or whatever it happens to be, so I give a

572
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:27,533
bit of rationale for perhaps a change of direction, and I do that every time

573
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:32,157
because I've just learned that if I don't sometimes, whilst I think it's all clear,

574
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,906
I think I've, you know, been a perfect communicator and the message hasn't got

575
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:39,208
across. So I also go through a bit of a, we

576
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,885
almost do a daily, you know, sort of, what are we going to

577
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:44,325
do today? So that's all very clear and so that

578
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:48,988
staff, if I'm out and about and not here all the time, they've got something

579
00:41:48,988 --> 00:41:52,537
written down that they're very clear that this is what's to be done.

580
00:41:52,537 --> 00:41:57,052
(Emily) Yeah, that's great advice. Thanks Ailsa.

581
00:41:57,052 --> 00:42:02,800
So I guess, in summary, having the right communication processes and systems

582
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,334
in your business is really really important. And whether they're formal; informal,

583
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:11,616
you know, all of these tools will help

584
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:16,588
you, better manage what's going on, making sure people know what's expected

585
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:18,704
of them, when they're performing and when they're

586
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:21,169
not. So whether it's a performance review

587
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:24,553
process, an induction process, your staff manual,

588
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:28,542
or where it's just a general email announcement.

589
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:32,136
It's really important to have those processes in place.

590
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:37,004
I've said this about ten times I think being prepared and having an agenda is

591
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:43,774
key to successful communication. Be ready for the hard questions and don't

592
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:48,290
hide and don't shift away from situations where you know there's going to be conflict

593
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:52,162
or it's going to make people uncomfortable. You, you are the business owner.

594
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:56,238
You need to step up to these situations and manage them head on, otherwise

595
00:42:56,238 --> 00:43:00,561
it'll just come back to bite you in the end. Practice makes perfect.

596
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:06,376
So, once again, doing this every day it's going to, you're going to get better and

597
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,271
better at it. It might feel a bit funny to begin with

598
00:43:09,271 --> 00:43:13,502
but if you keep doing it the time it will get easier and easier.

599
00:43:13,502 --> 00:43:19,325
Choose the right type of communication for the situation so whether it be an

600
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:25,595
announcement or a letter or whatever it needs to be you need to make sure that

601
00:43:25,595 --> 00:43:28,945
your communication's tailored to the outcome.

602
00:43:28,945 --> 00:43:35,860
And finally, face to face, we suggest its always best, how much, how many times have

603
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,073
you sent an email to someone and its either got lost in translation;

604
00:43:40,073 --> 00:43:45,157
things have been taken out of context. It's a lot better to walk over

605
00:43:45,157 --> 00:43:49,010
to the person's desk and tell them face to face or even pick up the phone.

606
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,254
And I think that, that's really about it.

607
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:56,946
So, basically, go forth and talk to your people.

608
00:43:56,946 --> 00:44:03,119
&gt;&gt; (Cara) Okay, great, thanks so much Ailsa and Emily, we've got a lot of questions and

609
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,725
so, I encourage you to keep on sending them

610
00:44:05,725 --> 00:44:10,203
through and I'll put as many of them as we have time to, to the pair.

611
00:44:10,203 --> 00:44:16,552
So first of all, we've got a bit of an interesting one from Michael.

612
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:21,073
He said this is the age old show stopper, how to deal with a staff member,

613
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:25,824
female, who has B.O. [LAUGH] (Emily) Okay.

614
00:44:25,824 --> 00:44:35,243
Yeah, this a tough one and it is a situation that I've had before.

615
00:44:35,243 --> 00:44:38,492
So my advice would be, I would get another female to speak to her.

616
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:43,493
It might be a little confronting if a male sat her down and gave her some feedback,

617
00:44:43,493 --> 00:44:49,522
but I would sit down and just explain to her about personal hygiene and

618
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:55,518
the importance of personal hygiene and very gently suggest that, she needs

619
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:59,608
to wear deodorant. &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Could I add to that?

620
00:44:59,608 --> 00:45:02,852
&gt;&gt; I would also, in the staff bathrooms, I would actually provide

621
00:45:02,852 --> 00:45:09,551
deodorant and sort of have it there and with just, a little sign, sort of like

622
00:45:09,551 --> 00:45:14,418
you know, something.. (Emily) Sort of um, 'keep fresh.'

623
00:45:14,418 --> 00:45:15,794
&gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Yeah, Keep Fresh.

624
00:45:15,794 --> 00:45:18,017
I like that. There you go.

625
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:19,708
[LAUGH] Yeah, or something along those lines.

626
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:22,743
I mean, if you, if humours, well, yeah. It's probably better to keep it straight.

627
00:45:22,743 --> 00:45:24,926
&gt;&gt; Really. (Cara) Okay.

628
00:45:24,926 --> 00:45:29,157
So some sweet smelling tips there. And we've got another question from

629
00:45:29,157 --> 00:45:32,301
Melissa. She says, how do you deal with a staff

630
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:36,034
member that ignores or disregards negative feedback?

631
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:42,667
(Emily) Yes, this is common one I guess if someone ignores negative feedback and it's

632
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:46,823
having an impact on their performance you may need to escalate that to a more

633
00:45:46,823 --> 00:45:52,363
formal performance management process, where you would give them

634
00:45:52,363 --> 00:46:00,578
warnings for failure to improve. So, it may be that you need to sit down

635
00:46:00,578 --> 00:46:05,871
and formally go through things and put in things in writing and let them to know

636
00:46:05,871 --> 00:46:09,183
what the consequences are if they don't improve their behaviour because if there

637
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:13,491
are no consequences then generally people won't change and they will disregard it.

638
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:20,291
(Cara) Okay, a bit of a practical issue from Scott.

639
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:24,523
He wants to know whether there's any tool or software that can help with task

640
00:46:24,523 --> 00:46:30,165
management on an ongoing basis. &gt;&gt; (Emily) Hmm, task management as in, like a

641
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:32,573
project management tool? &gt;&gt; (Cara) I'm not sure,

642
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:35,320
Scott, hasn't

643
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,744
&gt;&gt; given any further details. If he wants to send through more but,

644
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:45,657
perhaps if you can guess for now. (Ailsa) I'm happy to just say look seriously

645
00:46:45,657 --> 00:46:50,407
even just you know Microsoft Outlook if you're on PC, just the, just the

646
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,965
tasks list can be a ripper. You know something like that or if you're on

647
00:46:53,965 --> 00:46:57,988
Google Docs and you actually have a sort of a just even a manual or sort of you know,

648
00:46:57,988 --> 00:47:04,509
who's doing what. I mean that just keeping it really

649
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:08,251
simple, can be a very good way of, you know, just keeping up, keeping a bit

650
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:10,238
of a track of it. It's not anything sophisticated but,

651
00:47:10,238 --> 00:47:12,656
it's, it's there and available to most businesses.

652
00:47:12,656 --> 00:47:16,656
&gt;&gt; (Cara) Okay and we've had a tip from a listener, Michael who says TRELLO is a

653
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:19,640
great free browser task management software.

654
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,214
T.R.E.L.L.O he says.

655
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,613
&gt;&gt;(Emily) Wow. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. There you go.

656
00:47:24,613 --> 00:47:28,278
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [LAUGH] (Cara) So we've got

657
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:33,074
another, question from Kate. She says coming in as a new manager to

658
00:47:33,074 --> 00:47:36,143
introduce and develop new systems, how do you go about introducing those to

659
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:40,870
existing staff to get them on board and view them as positive not negative?

660
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:46,933
(Emily) Sure, I guess this is really around change management and the first step in

661
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:53,102
change management is helping people to understand why you need to change and

662
00:47:53,102 --> 00:47:57,263
I guess the whole thing around, what's in it for me, is a good way to do that.

663
00:47:57,263 --> 00:48:04,531
So involving them from the very beginning in a new project getting their input,

664
00:48:04,531 --> 00:48:12,537
getting them to help come up with solutions will enable them to I guess more easily accept

665
00:48:12,537 --> 00:48:18,421
what's going on is my best advice. &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) And I'll just add to that by also

666
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:22,092
you know talking with the staff and finding out a little bit about them and

667
00:48:22,092 --> 00:48:26,074
potentially what might be their barriers to the change and being really honest

668
00:48:26,074 --> 00:48:29,283
about that, I think acknowledging you know, because with change,

669
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:32,776
there's always some you know, negative sides as well as some positive sides.

670
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:36,740
So I think it's about being you know, open and honest and acknowledging the

671
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,110
negative because sometimes when we're bring in change, we just keep trying

672
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:43,567
to, you know, promote the benefits of it, but people,

673
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,353
you know, people, in their minds, know the negatives, so by, sometimes by just

674
00:48:46,353 --> 00:48:50,336
getting those out of the way, acknowledging them, then you can, really

675
00:48:50,336 --> 00:48:53,580
can move forward to some of the positive stuff.

676
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:58,166
&gt;&gt; (Cara) Okay, that's great, Ailsa. Now I've got a question from Melissa.

677
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:01,406
She says, how do you deal with a staff member that ignores or disregards

678
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:04,161
negative feedback?

679
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:08,426
(Emily) Did we already have that question?

680
00:49:08,426 --> 00:49:10,824
&gt;&gt; I think I was going to say we've already answered that question.

681
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:16,469
&gt;&gt; (Cara) Okay I'm repeating myself okay, that's alright we've got lots more here

682
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:20,770
to go, we've got a question from Leo he wants to know are teams rewards

683
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:26,244
appropriate, as well as individuals. (Emily) Yeah, I would definitely encourage team

684
00:49:26,244 --> 00:49:32,407
based rewards, you could come up with an incentive program that rewarded the whole team not

685
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:39,670
just individuals I think that's a great way to build that sense of team ensure

686
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,748
that people are alligned to the outcome and to your business strategy, so I would

687
00:49:45,826 --> 00:49:48,906
definitely encourage that. &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Yeah and I would agree as long as

688
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:54,833
you know, the team is working together, to achieve a goal, because

689
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:59,662
sometimes, I think it can back fire when there's sort of um, if

690
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:07,953
certain people working really hard, and then, if then there's a generic reward

691
00:50:07,953 --> 00:50:11,371
across the company, you know, based on a few people's kind of performance, I think

692
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:14,691
that's when it can backfire. &gt;&gt; (Emily) Yeah, I totally agree, it needs to

693
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:21,281
ensure that everybody is engaged. And rewarded for whatever the incentive is.

694
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:27,417
&gt;&gt; (Cara) Okay that's interesting, and Josie wants to know how do you manage staff

695
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:31,472
that don't directly report to you however you've been asked to manage them by your

696
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:35,881
direct report regarding projects when a direct manager is not there.

697
00:50:35,881 --> 00:50:41,415
(Emily) Hmm, that's probably a common issue, and that's I guess really around

698
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:47,738
influencing people. And then, I guess having the skills to, to

699
00:50:47,738 --> 00:50:54,853
try and get people on board with projects when they are not necessarily your employee,

700
00:50:54,853 --> 00:50:59,823
it can be quite difficult. Maybe they could speak to the persons

701
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:06,383
manager and ask for help. Getting that person to help them with

702
00:51:06,383 --> 00:51:10,863
that project, it's a bit of a tricky one Ailsa, what do you think?

703
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:14,574
&gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Well the only thing I'm thinking, is that whoever has got the authority needs to endorse the

704
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:18,865
role that they're putting you into and even though they're sort of saying well

705
00:51:18,865 --> 00:51:22,783
look they don't have to directly report to you I think they're just saying to

706
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:26,871
re-clarify what they're expecting from both staff members in that situation

707
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:31,880
rather than just throw it on to someone who's the subordinate and say, sort it out.

708
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,740
You know, I don't think that's, I don't think that's fair.

709
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,758
So I think it's about re-communicating if, if the position has changed so that

710
00:51:38,758 --> 00:51:41,574
there's a different reporting structure or there's a different accountability

711
00:51:41,574 --> 00:51:44,363
structure, whatever. That needs to be communicated by the

712
00:51:44,363 --> 00:51:47,407
person who ultimately has the responsibility.

713
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:51,591
(Cara) Okay. That's helpful.

714
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:56,103
And Sharon wants to know how to deal with, it's quite simple from Sharon actually,

715
00:51:56,103 --> 00:52:00,443
but tricky, how do you deal with staff who don't get on?

716
00:52:00,443 --> 00:52:08,093
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] (Emily) How long is a piece of string? I guess that's a really tough one.

717
00:52:08,093 --> 00:52:14,618
Sometimes you may need to get the staff member into a room and do a bit of a

718
00:52:14,618 --> 00:52:20,157
mediation session to say "Ok, guys, lets talk about the issues here and if you are

719
00:52:20,157 --> 00:52:27,133
upset with each other, what's going on," and try to get them to agree to disagree,

720
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:30,452
or agree to work together. I found in the past,

721
00:52:30,452 --> 00:52:34,157
sometimes that works but I guess the two people need to be willing

722
00:52:34,157 --> 00:52:37,784
that. If it's about behaviour and people

723
00:52:37,784 --> 00:52:42,161
behaving inappropriately, I guess, are going to deal with that separately.

724
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:47,379
&gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Yeah look I'd have to agree with what Emily is saying, the only thing I'd

725
00:52:47,379 --> 00:52:51,257
add to it is, it is about identifying, you know, is it just a personality clash

726
00:52:51,257 --> 00:52:53,162
or, or is there some sort of behaviour

727
00:52:53,162 --> 00:52:57,359
that one of the the parties is doing, that is unacceptable.

728
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,307
It's sort of identifying what's going on there. Some team building can always be a

729
00:53:01,307 --> 00:53:03,918
good thing, you know social functions outside the

730
00:53:03,918 --> 00:53:05,491
office can be good, you know.

731
00:53:05,491 --> 00:53:09,320
You might want get someone in that can run some of those, that's often proven to

732
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,979
be very, very effective. But look, at the end of the day I think

733
00:53:12,979 --> 00:53:16,294
it is really important I know that there's, there's 2 sides to it.

734
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:19,751
One is, you know, having diversity can be fantastic for problem solving and things

735
00:53:19,751 --> 00:53:22,824
like that. But in small business, you know, having a

736
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:26,412
personality clash, if its a small staff, you know its a nightmare.

737
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:30,856
So I think sometimes you almost need to perhaps be really upfront to both of them

738
00:53:30,856 --> 00:53:33,573
and say look, this is, you know, this is a bit of a

739
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:37,238
nightmare and it's putting the business in a bit of

740
00:53:37,238 --> 00:53:39,994
a tricky situation. So have you got some solutions for how we

741
00:53:39,994 --> 00:53:42,142
can work through this? You know?

742
00:53:42,142 --> 00:53:45,675
Yeah, anyway, and I could go harsher but I won't [LAUGH].

743
00:53:45,675 --> 00:53:48,911
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]. &gt;&gt; (Cara) We've got a tip here from one of

744
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:52,082
our listeners Michael, and he said, he's actually had an excellent result in a

745
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:57,161
situation where, the business culture included a large amount of interpersonal

746
00:53:57,161 --> 00:54:01,158
conflict between staff. And what he did was get a professional

747
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:04,922
trainer to assist with and had excellent results in cultural change and it was

748
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:09,716
assisted with funding through the enterprise connect and also skills for

749
00:54:09,716 --> 00:54:13,172
growth. &gt;&gt; (AIlsa) Oh, there you go, brilliant.

750
00:54:13,172 --> 00:54:17,513
&gt;&gt; (Cara) Yes, so that's a good tip. I'll give you a final question here.

751
00:54:17,513 --> 00:54:23,433
Martine says she thinks she communicates quite well with her staff and when she

752
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:25,692
asks for feedback it's always rather positive.

753
00:54:25,692 --> 00:54:28,864
But she still continues to have some recurring issues.

754
00:54:28,864 --> 00:54:32,499
How does she really know if it's the way she communicates or if

755
00:54:32,499 --> 00:54:36,489
the staff are just not listening. &gt;&gt; (Emily) Good question.

756
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:41,844
&gt;&gt; I guess a tool to get

757
00:54:41,844 --> 00:54:47,026
some, some feedback from her staff maybe a 360 review.

758
00:54:47,026 --> 00:54:54,079
So, she may if she is a small business owner be able to engage a consultant to come out

759
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,302
and do a 360 review process so she can get some balanced feedback, a lot of the time

760
00:54:59,302 --> 00:55:04,801
if it's your manager is quite scary to give them really honest feedback because

761
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:08,748
you're worried about the implications of giving that feedback.

762
00:55:08,748 --> 00:55:14,713
So to use a 360 review process you can get that feedback in a confidential manner,

763
00:55:14,713 --> 00:55:21,657
where people will feel more comfortable doing that but if that's not an option because

764
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:27,490
it might be too expensive or it's just not something can be done I would encourage

765
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:32,240
her to be more direct with her staff and say I want you to give feedback and I'm not going

766
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,585
to get upset when you do so. And give

767
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:39,958
them permission to tell her the truth. &gt;&gt; (Ailsa) I was just going to say that another

768
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:43,798
that say we do in, with marketing is when you really want to know what your

769
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:47,504
customers think of you, is usually what does work, is that you get an independent

770
00:55:47,504 --> 00:55:52,582
person to ring up and and have a confidential discussion.

771
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:56,672
And then, you know, later on, you may ask the person, is it okay

772
00:55:56,672 --> 00:56:00,488
if this information is fed back without revealing name?

773
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:02,950
Or is it okay if it's fed back, revealing name?

774
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,780
And often, what can happen is when that is initiated by the business, it's

775
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:11,270
incredible how people are then is going, oh wow, they really want to

776
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:17,089
improve this, how they then will perhaps provide honest

777
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:20,824
feedback and, and then what can happen is it can be delivered to the business owner

778
00:56:20,824 --> 00:56:24,392
in a way that can be heard without the staff actually having to deliver that

779
00:56:24,392 --> 00:56:27,596
themselves. (Cara) Okay.

780
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:35,918
Yeah, it sounds like there's a few solutions to that one, so good luck Martine.

781
00:56:35,918 --> 00:56:41,075
Alright well that's all the questions we have time for although there will be a

782
00:56:41,075 --> 00:56:46,743
chance if you want to turn to Twitter using the hashtag #talk to staff

783
00:56:46,743 --> 00:56:54,327
to ask a few more questions. But for the webinar section I'd just like

784
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:58,948
to really thank everyone for participating and thanks for all your

785
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:04,740
brilliant questions. That's been really insightful.

786
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,692
And, thanks to our partner for today's webinar

787
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:10,515
Business Victoria. You will have seen a few links up on the

788
00:57:10,515 --> 00:57:13,755
screen during this seminar to the Business Victoria website.

789
00:57:13,755 --> 00:57:16,240
So I'd encourage you to go and have a look at that.

790
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,824
There's a lot of information on there and

791
00:57:18,824 --> 00:57:23,240
when you get your slide pack, you can just click through to those links and

792
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,827
find more information on some of those issues.

793
00:57:25,827 --> 00:57:31,907
So thank you very much, thank you obviously to Ailsa and Emily for sharing

794
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,633
your expertise and to everyone for joining in

795
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:38,936
on another smart company seminar and, we'll have details of the next one

796
00:57:38,936 --> 00:57:41,793
coming up. Thank you.

797
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:44,156
&gt;&gt; (Ailsa) Thank you. &gt;&gt; (Emily)Thank you.
