00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,590
Hello everyone, and welcome to the latest Smart Company webinar.

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,850
Communicating with your staff is the topic today.

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:18,672
my name's Cara Waters, I'm the editor of Smart Company and today I'm joined online

4
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:25,490
by Ailsa Page who owns A and P Marketing Works, a small business.

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,030
So she'll be able to give some insights into how she communicates with her staff.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:37,410
And we've got Emily Jaksch who is the lady behind HR Gurus.

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,065
And she'll also be giving us some information but specifically from the

8
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:48,500
export, expert point of view of human resources.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,091
So what you need to do today to participate is, firstly, just sit back

10
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:56,107
and listen. Audio is going to be automatically

11
00:00:56,107 --> 00:01:01,771
streamed through your computer speakers. And you can also participate through

12
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:06,692
Twitter. if you @ Smart Company, and use the

13
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:14,138
hashtag talktostaff. Finally and probably the main way the

14
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:18,760
most of you will participate is asking questions by the questions panel.

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,654
To do that, you just type in your questions in the space at the bottom and

16
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:29,900
click on Send. I'll then be, putting the questions to.

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,732
the presenters from you so on your behalf so, do feel free to fire away its a great

18
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:41,140
opportunity to have some experts on line here.

19
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,795
And, ask them what you want. Alright and finally don't worry about

20
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:53,467
hurriedly scribbling things down. Because if you miss something, you will

21
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:56,358
be sent a copy of the slides and a link to the webinar recording tomorrow

22
00:01:56,358 --> 00:02:00,233
afternoon. And so we'll have all that information

23
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:04,206
for you. And just before we get going, a big thank

24
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:09,785
you to our partner for today's webinar, Business Victoria.

25
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:14,010

26
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,520

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,080
So, now I'm going to hand over to our presenters, for our webinar,

28
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,490
Communicating with Staff. So, take it away, Emily and Ailsa.

29
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,347
Thanks, Cara, Well, today we're talking about, as she

30
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:37,514
mentioned, communicating with staff. My name's Emily Jaksch.

31
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:41,814
And I'll be joined by Ailsa Page, who will be giving me some insights

32
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:45,034
from a small business perspective.

33
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:50,321
We've got quite a bit to get through. So, as you would know from the content that

34
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:56,509
we're going to cover today we're looking at how to set up processes so communication doesn't get lost.

35
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:02,263
Communication around this is a tricky topic that you probably try and avoid at all costs,

36
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:06,370
getting the messages across to all staff inductions.

37
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,701
The best way to communicate to develop loyalty and build teams; how to let your staff know if they are not

38
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:14,983
performing and how to praise them when they are.

39
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:20,377
How to communicate change and forming them face to face communication. Okay.

40
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:25,241
So the first topic we're going to talk about is effective communication process, in that it is

41
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:31,440
really important that you setup both formal and informal communication processes.

42
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,704
The first one is really just having a business plan and making it visible to your staff

43
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:39,292
So you could have scorecards. I've got clients who had visual

44
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:42,802
boards on their wall so everybody know exactly what's expected of them on a day

45
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:46,528
to day basis and where the company is heading.

46
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:50,310
And next thing is a really simple one, it's around having a job description

47
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,278
and making sure that it is kept up to date, and this is around making sure people know what's expected

48
00:03:54,278 --> 00:04:04,142
of them what their job is. The next one and having an induction and all

49
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:08,651
training for your staff also very important and finally having a performance review process.

50
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:13,160
I guess informally, staff meetings

51
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,599
which lots of people probably don't do enough of

52
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:20,380
or if they do they are probably not as conclusive as they would like to be

53
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:23,478
so it's really important to use staff meetings that have an agenda

54
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,899
staff anncouments vai email verbally it's

55
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:33,246
really important that people are aware of what's going on.

56
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:38,450
One on one coaching sessions are also really important around communication, people want to know

57
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,971
feedback around their performance. And finally, using the social media, you

58
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:48,000
know, the internal internet, is a great way to publish communication and

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,030
make sure that it's not lost. I guess the key purpose of all of this is making sure people understand

60
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,987
what's expected of them,what's happening

61
00:04:57,987 --> 00:05:01,697
[INAUDIBLE] and finally what's going to be rewarded.

62
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:06,099
And I guess I'd like to ask Ailsa what she thinks of all these

63
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:09,216
different communication processes or what works best

64
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:11,870
for you in your business.

65
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,400
Great. Well, look hello everyone.

66
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,730
it's great to be here. Now just to, yeah.

67
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,442
I, look, I think it is important to communicate at different levels with your

68
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:23,830
staff. Some people are very verbal, obviously.

69
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,940
Other people like to see things written down.

70
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,060
And I think the most important thing is to make sure that whatever's it's in the

71
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,476
job description is actually then, also, that you've got a

72
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:36,850
consistency of communication as well. But I think it depends on the size of the

73
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,573
business. If you've got lots of people, then you

74
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,790
probably will have a bit more written documentation.

75
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,455
If you've only got, sort of, a couple of staff or maybe some part time staff,

76
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:50,690
it obviously will be a little bit more on the informal side of things.

77
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,799
But I think it's good to have both, because, if you just have things that are

78
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:58,504
informal, then, I think a little bit can perhaps sometimes it's not as taken as

79
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:00,858
seriously as stuff that's written down.

80
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:03,212
So, one of the things I certainly do with my staff

81
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,568
my, with my staff, is I do have things written down,

82
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,154
I'll check in with them, to see, to let them know what's been happening with the,

83
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:14,556
with the business, what are some updates, and also just to reiterate again,

84
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:22,120
particularly for, say, this week, what might be the priorities for this week.

85
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,226
Fantastic. That's great advice.

86
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:26,566
So, I just want to refer to the Business Victoria website.

87
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:30,310
There's an enormous amount of great content on the site.

88
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,126
So, you don't have to create these things from scratch

89
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:38,656
I know that is seems a bit scary, but they've got business planning templates,

90
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:44,528
they've got job description templates, they've got advice on induction and

91
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:48,057
training. They've also got a performance review

92
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:52,093
process on there with some advice about creating KPI's in your business.

93
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:56,312
But please refer back to that. because it will definitely help you if

94
00:06:56,312 --> 00:07:00,011
you are starting from scratch. Okay, so another thing that we wanted to

95
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:04,114
talk about today is effective induction processes.

96
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:08,952
So, I cannot stress enough the importance of that first day induction.

97
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:13,176
Research tells us that the, the key reason that people leave within the first

98
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:18,586
three months is a lack of induction. There's nothing worse than rocking up on your first

99
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:20,884
day. And finding that you don't have a desk,

100
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:25,028
you don't have a computer, and no one wants to spend any time with you.

101
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,430
So making sure that you're ready for that person on that first day is really,

102
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,156
really important. you need to make them feel welcome.

103
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:36,116
You need to introduce them to everybody. You need to also go through the terms and

104
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:39,464
conditions of their employment, your policies, and a really good way to do

105
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:45,215
that is with the staff handbook. There is actually a great template available on

106
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:49,876
the Business Victoria website if you don't have one which is the basic policy that any small

107
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:55,114
business would need. Following on from that the first week is also

108
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:59,385
really important. This is where you really need to provide that on the

109
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:03,610
job training to ensure that people know exactly what's expected of them and if you don't

110
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,380
have time to do it a really great tip is to use a buddy so allocate that

111
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,748
partner mutual. So that you can ensure that you're

112
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:16,896
controlling exactly what that person needs to know to ensure they can do their

113
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,804
job. Finally, another recommendation to make

114
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:25,300
sure your induction is really successful is to have follow up.

115
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,101
in place for 30, 60 and 90 days. So, that means holding on, to your new

116
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:31,761
person, checking in to see how they're going,

117
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,891
and then finally the most important thing is ensuring that you communicate with

118
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:40,860
that person whether or not they've completed their induction or not.

119
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,794
Sorry, their probation. A lot of businesses forget to do that.

120
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:54,453
Whether its in a letter whether you sit them down and say congratulations it's just about keeping those

121
00:08:54,453 --> 00:09:01,075
communication lines open in the first 3 months of employment. So, Ailsa as a small business owner how

122
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:07,530
important do you think induction is. Sorry I just jumped in there [LAUGH].

123
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,430
What I was going to say that is that look induction is everything because it really

124
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,816
is the first impression. And as we know first impressions count so

125
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:19,474
I 100% agree with what you're saying about being organized really, really

126
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:22,050
important. If you're not.

127
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,954
You know, if you don't at least give the impression of organization on the first

128
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:28,981
day, sometimes that can unsettle staff. So I think it is, its really worth taking

129
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:32,083
the time to you know have a, have a fresh desk, have everything ready for them if

130
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,740
they're in the office. You know just, make sure that its all

131
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,744
there. And then I think a big one too is to

132
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,280
really go through all the OH&S, if things go, even if you're in a home based

133
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,230
business you know, that's at home. All of that thing is to show them that

134
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,702
you actually are about them and I think that is really important to get out there

135
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:53,286
right at the front I mean you know I know many staff have giggled when I show them

136
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:57,038
the fire extinguisher, I just want them to know that we haven't because believe it

137
00:09:57,038 --> 00:10:04,582
or not we did have a fire in the office. It was a random thing now, but it's really

138
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:07,463
important that [LAUGH] everyone know how to use that. So, I think that's a really

139
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:10,710
a good thing. And if, you know, even if you might be

140
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,191
fairly casual in the way that you are with your staff, you need to be very

141
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:19,407
professional with your induction. You need to show that this is serious,

142
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:24,290
that it is work and talk through all those things in a very professional way.

143
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,014
You can still be friendly, but you need to be professional.

144
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:30,240
That's great advice. I've just got a question

145
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,780
there for, the two of you really, interested to get Ailsa and Emily's

146
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,238
opinion. Aah, Kathrine has asked, should the staff

147
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:44,210
handbook covered the induction include all of the companies polices?

148
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,115
Yes I would say that it should. It's a great time to make sure that people

149
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:52,671
know what the rules are in a workplace and I would also encourage that at the end of that get

150
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:57,091
them to sign something that they have read and understood all the policies and

151
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:03,296
that would help protect you later on if there are any issues.

152
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:07,918
And I would agree so, yeah great. I was going to say I would agree if

153
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:13,084
you've got all of that and if you want you're giong to be getting lots of staff

154
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:18,902
particularly if you're not going to be in easy,

155
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:25,350
if, you know if you're not going to be there a lot to supervise staff or just to,

156
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,746
or for staff to ask you questions, then I think the more you can provide to

157
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:32,655
them, so that they don't feel left out the wilderness is very important.

158
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:37,097
Yeah I would agree. There's nothing worse then someone rocking up on their first day

159
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,265
and then they get shown the desk and then that's it

160
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:43,485
and they're expected to miraculously know what their job is,

161
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:47,900
the induction is about, introducing them into your business.

162
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,903
Helping him to understand what the rules arefor your business and how they're going to I guess be

163
00:11:53,903 --> 00:12:00,190
measured and what, what's expected of them in a performance perspective.

164
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,592
It's, it's really important that it, it's done formally.

165
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:08,330
Great. Thanks.

166
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,172
Okay. So once again we'll go back to the Business Victoria website.

167
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:15,081
There's a whole section there about

168
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:21,015
induction and probation and there's a section page there for a staff handbook for a smaller business to pick up

169
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:26,777
basically putting your company name and being able to tailor it a little bit and have a pretty workable

170
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:34,455
document straight away. What so I guess the big question is why

171
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:39,555
do we do this, why do we want small businesses to communicate with staff and that's easy because it is what

172
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:44,740
drives performance, because its really the way people learn through learning to

173
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:52,880
communicate what we want them to start, stop, and continue.

174
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,060
And secondly it creates opportunity for professional and personal development

175
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,870
but it's really about providing that coaching to your staff to help them not only

176
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,236
develop this job but help them develop their career. Finally it's about

177
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:14,939
communicating appreciation, praise and credit for their effort. How else do people know unless you sit

178
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:18,470
them down and give them a pat on the back.

179
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,182
It doesn't cost anything to give them a pat on the back and say thank you and I know

180
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:30,780
what it feels like if someone tells me I've done a great job it gives you a massive buck up and you go home feeling

181
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,339
really good about your work and that's what communication is about.

182
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,413
It is really about managing people well, building relationships with them, you're opening that dialogue.

183
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:46,700
You're improving morale, you're building teamwork and you're setting people up for success.

184
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,122
Then, if you're not doing it, how do your people know what you're thinking, a lot of business owners

185
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:55,520
probably get bogged down in the day to day and sit in their office.

186
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,056
They don't spend enough time getting out there and talking with their people about

187
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:03,805
what's going on. Generally the only time that business

188
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:07,088
owners probably speak to their staff is when they have done something wrong and

189
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:14,532
they're giving them negative feedback. So once again an essential part of

190
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:22,132
engaging people on a day to day basis. So, Ailsa,

191
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:25,090
I just want to get your experience as a business owner of maybe some good and bad

192
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,374
communication feedback type experiences that you've had.

193
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:31,510
Mm, okay. Well, I'm going to talk about some good

194
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,634
stuff first. And, and that is,

195
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:37,177
And it's actually out of, this was not so much when I was in my own

196
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,379
business. But when I was actually managing,

197
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,490
I was actually managing. Volunteers, and, you know, so this

198
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,728
is people who are working for no money [LAUGH] Yeah.

199
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:51,348
And one of the things I, I really discovered was the importance of taking

200
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:58,448
the time out to, when people arrive in the workplace to meet and greet,

201
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:02,044
say G'day, catch up with them, give them a little bit of time right at the

202
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:05,470
beginning, but that's been, a, really important

203
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,470
thing to do and that what I found was that then one, because I used to be

204
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,920
worried about all the interruptions that would happen when people constantly

205
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,320
you know,interrupting you. And I always found that,

206
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,752
if you, spent that time initially, and just check in with people then, until you

207
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,924
know give them clear intructions and things like that then, they're less

208
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:27,760
likely to come and, come back and actually, you know, interrupt.

209
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,892
So for me that was a, a, a really good to, spend a lot of time first up with

210
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:34,313
people, but in terms of, you know providing

211
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:37,109
feedback, look I found that generally, when

212
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:40,727
you provide some negative feedback [LAUGH] it can be challenging to you, but

213
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:44,525
one of the good examples was when, clearly,

214
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:47,533
you know, someone takes on board what you're saying and improves and then

215
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,105
actually, you know. Yes. &gt;&gt; Is able to then go on and do, and do

216
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:55,250
work even better in, in the role that they had.

217
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,869
So obviously that's a good one. A bad experience perhaps was with one of

218
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:02,217
the staff that I had, and it was, look, I think the bottom line was I probably

219
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:06,420
recruited badly, and that was my, my issue there.

220
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,710
So really, the person didn't really have the skills required for the job that we

221
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:17,770
were, that I was employing them to do. And it was, it did end in tears.

222
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,940
Which I think is every small business owners nightmare.

223
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,510
When, you know, the last thing you want to do is upset someone.

224
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:30,880
But I think the, the bottom line was the realization that, that that.

225
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,760
About the lack of matching of the person to the job.

226
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,380
And it was, and it was very upsetting for the person who was employed.

227
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,600
And it was upsetting for me, too. So that was, you know,

228
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,540
that wasn't great. But then you just, you know,

229
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,186
you work through that. You, you accept that for some-,

230
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:47,370
sometimes, you know, with those hard conversations

231
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,662
they're certainly not easy. I mean, it's like,

232
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:51,134
It's like a relationship breakdown. You know, they're not easy to have but,

233
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,208
sometimes you need to have them. &gt;&gt; Sure.

234
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,848
So, how do you approach that situation with that staff or what did you actually

235
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,746
do? &gt;&gt; Which one?

236
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,095
The teary one? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

237
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:04,213
&gt;&gt; Well, I was really honest. I basically just you know, sat them down.

238
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:04,994
I. &gt;&gt; Mm hm.

239
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:08,757
&gt;&gt; Always think a cup of tea is always a great thing to have on hand

240
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:11,126
&gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; For both people and you know, and

241
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:15,446
just or stroke, stroke spoke very straight and just sort explained that

242
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:20,660
look this is sort of the expectations of the job,

243
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,680
this is what I was expecting, this is you know perhaps this is, the performance

244
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,050
isn't really measuring up to the expectations.

245
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:33,375
I, and then I asked a staff member what they thought and, you know, they

246
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,597
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They agreed and I guess at that time

247
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:39,188
that was when the tears came too, and I guess it was perhaps the realization for them

248
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:42,840
that yeah, it wasn't really working out.

249
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,064
Yeah so then what I did, I was just then turned into a human and not a, a not, you

250
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:51,024
know, a manager and, and just sort of, you know, allowed the person to be

251
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:57,434
upset and, you know sort of sat with that really. And then, and then we sort of worked on

252
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:59,990
some more practical things of what we could do.

253
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,890
After that. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. And that's a really good point you

254
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,478
mentioned that you were honest with them and is really the key thing with feedback and

255
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:12,510
communiciation is that honesty and that a lot of the time honest feedback is quite

256
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,172
hard to give and is really hard for that person to hear it but it's the only way

257
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:21,538
that people are going to learn and grow and contrary to what a lot of people

258
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:30,910
think, people actually want to hear this stuff, they want to know if they're not performing

259
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,260
and they want to know if they're doing a good job.

260
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,174
&gt;&gt; Okay just to interrupt with some questions that we've got coming through

261
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:44,932
from readers or listeners Lauren ihas a question for Ailsa, she wants to know is

262
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:50,972
there ever a good way to deliver bad feedback.

263
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:55,230
&gt;&gt; Oooo, good question, look, what do I think?

264
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,154
Is there ever a good way. Look, I think there's a good way, there's

265
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:02,918
better ways of doing it., you know, and again I think saying,

266
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:08,052
supporting what Emily said which is that, ulltimately deep down most people just

267
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:11,651
most people know the truth I actually think anyway so sometimes it can

268
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:16,510
actually be a relief to just get it out there in the open.

269
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,570
My feeling is you certainly, I don't like that idea of

270
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,461
letting someone know, oh look, we really need to have a talk, and then

271
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:27,210
leaving this enormous amount of time and stress to develop.

272
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,620
So for me it's about, it's about being kind of pretty clear, pretty up front

273
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,960
making sure it's not about the person, but about the situation.

274
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,970
And, and probably just delivering it sooner rather than later.

275
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,039
[CROSSTALK] I think that, that's, that's great.

276
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:47,149
it's sorry just another one from Edwin, who says, I report to somebody who's very

277
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:50,364
stingy on praise and thanks. &gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

278
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:53,414
&gt;&gt; Had you import, in part your boss that a simple sporadic pat on the back is

279
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:58,424
better appreciated. I think that, they should just tell them

280
00:19:58,424 --> 00:20:03,009
and say that they would like to hear more feedback from them.

281
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:07,694
And they would like some, you know, more information about how

282
00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:12,335
they're going on a daily basis. I think it's totally acceptable to, to

283
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:16,736
manage us I guess because we're always doing it. I mean, I would actually suggest that

284
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:20,884
during the time that if a, a, with the stingy manager, is when they are giving

285
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:25,440
you a, at the time they were giving you some praise, I would try, you know, at that point

286
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,927
say, you know, when you do that? That makes me feel great and I just

287
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:35,668
want to work harder for you or something along those lines.

288
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,773
&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] At the time if you could

289
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:41,175
if you know if, if that could be done at the time so perhaps, perhaps practice

290
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:46,252
that one keep it you know in your pocket. And when, when you know,

291
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:49,900
&gt;&gt; Suddenly stingies turn generous for a moment [LAUGH] and then you know bring

292
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,548
out that particular comment and maybe then that will, is a nice way of perhaps

293
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:58,817
letting a business owner know, oh, okay. Because what they really want is they

294
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:01,148
want their staff to work hard for them and sometimes they don't know how to do

295
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:04,872
that. &gt;&gt; Exactly that's, that's really good

296
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:07,852
advice Ailsa. I'll agree.

297
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:11,332
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great tip, and we've got another tip, actually, from one of the

298
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:14,870
people listening in, Greg, and he suggests the sandwich method, which he

299
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,194
said is sometimes the best delivery. You say something they do good, the bad,

300
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:22,718
and them leave them on a high again. &gt;&gt; Oh,

301
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:27,646
I've actually got a slide coming up in regards to sandwiching

302
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:29,922
feedback. But I might

303
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:33,277
talk about that about that in a minute Okay I'll give you one more question then

304
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:37,249
before we move on. It's a question from Roula who says how

305
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:41,155
do you deal with a boss who has very bad communciation skills and is constantly

306
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:45,410
communicating confusing and contradictory messages.

307
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:50,810
Hm, that's a really tough one. I'm sure that everyone's had a manage who has

308
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,966
done this. I've had managers in the past who did

309
00:21:54,966 --> 00:22:00,678
exactly that and I use to make sure that I, I regurgitated back to them to make

310
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:07,720
sure that I was completely clear on what they wanted me to do.

311
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,013
So, if they ask me to do something that was a bit confusing, I'd say, so what you're asking is

312
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:19,420
this and them get to further clarify. It can be quite frustrating I would

313
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,376
imagine. &gt;&gt; Can I just make a comment here and

314
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:26,536
it is interesting I mean that these sort of coming from staff and guess for the

315
00:22:26,536 --> 00:22:30,826
business owners who are listening in, this is really really important because you know

316
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:37,330
your inability to communicate, affects your staff.

317
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,291
And this is why, I guess, you know, it's fantastic that you are, if you're the

318
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,064
business owners, are listening to this, because this is helping you to

319
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:47,320
communicate well with staff. And sometimes it's not necessarily

320
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,100
something that comes naturally, and many people in small business haven't had that

321
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,772
experience of managing staff, and so I would actually encourage business owners

322
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:58,875
to, you know, get some coaching in that area.

323
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,169
Because otherwise the response is, you know, you, what's going to happen is

324
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:05,409
your staff are going to say, look, you know, I, I'm finding this really hard

325
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:09,081
because to that particular listener or caller who's out there you know sometimes

326
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:12,483
I'd say look you had a go at trying to, work with, with the, the manager but

327
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:15,939
sometimes you know it gets too hard and, and that's make you want to go and look

328
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:22,260
for another job. And I think this is something that small

329
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,077
business owners need to hear. &gt;&gt; Yeah I, I agree totally its a really

330
00:23:27,077 --> 00:23:35,999
important point. &gt;&gt; Okay, great I'll let you keep going

331
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:40,548
then. &gt;&gt; Okay, so we were talking about the

332
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:44,942
importance of honest feedback and what we suggest with business owners is that

333
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:49,534
you provide honest feedback frequently. That you make sure that you're focused

334
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:55,208
when you're giving it to people that you don't just kind of do it in the hallway.

335
00:23:55,208 --> 00:24:00,040
that you're really specific because, if you're specifc with your people about what

336
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,261
they're doing right or wrong, then they'll understand very clearly what you expect

337
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:07,442
of them. Make sure that if you give them

338
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:10,021
feedback that is actionable and is in their control.

339
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:14,305
Make sure that it's balanced, that its not just all negative feedback or all

340
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:19,136
positive feedback, you need to give both. Make sure that you give it with

341
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:23,988
attention and make sure they're timely. So, there's no point saving up 12 months

342
00:24:23,988 --> 00:24:28,184
of feedback and giving it to somebody in their performance review.

343
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:32,136
What you need to do is talk to people about things as they happen.

344
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:36,954
So, if somebody does something wrong, if somebody is late you need to talk to them

345
00:24:36,954 --> 00:24:41,480
that day, you don't let it go for 2 weeks or save it up until they've been late 6

346
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,824
times. So now I'm going to very quickly go through some tips on

347
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:51,894
how to give staff quality feedback and praise when they're doing a great job and this doesn't come

348
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:59,816
naturally to everybody. It is something that needs to be practiced.

349
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:06,008
And sometimes, managers or business owners might feel quite strange or insincere about giving

350
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:12,000
people praise or positive feedback. You should practice and do it over and over again to make sure

351
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,151
you get much better at it. [LAUGH] So I've probably said this

352
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:21,120
before that be prepared don't script what you're going to say.

353
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,034
Ensure that you have an agenda and that you're ready to sit down and give that person

354
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:29,700
your full focus focus. um, I've already just said that.

355
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,403
So be generous, fair and honest in giving feedback don't be too over the top but

356
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:40,810
don't be stingy, it's very important to give credit where it's due.

357
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:45,709
Be sincer, so if you're not being sincere your staff member will probably think

358
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:50,465
what do they want. You know need to make sure that you continue to

359
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:55,143
give people praise. Um be timely, I've already talked about this,

360
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:59,168
it's about giving people feedback at the time of something happening not

361
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:03,143
waiting. this is really important knowing when

362
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:07,835
to speak publically. Some people love being praised in public

363
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:12,361
where as other people find it quite embarrassing and they get really uncomfortable, it's about

364
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:17,635
talking to people the way they want to be spoken to.

365
00:26:17,635 --> 00:26:23,391
So re-enforce not only results but also behaviour, so use a balanced approach there.

366
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:28,266
And it's really important to explain the impact to the team and business, that they

367
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:33,690
understand the core impact of what they've done and how important it is.

368
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,736
I'm now going to talk about giving negative feedback.

369
00:26:37,736 --> 00:26:42,706
do quite badly or probably avoid doing.

370
00:26:42,706 --> 00:26:46,001
So once again I cannot stress how

371
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:51,378
important it is to be prepared. Especially when giving negative feedback, it's probably even more important

372
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:56,470
that you have an agenda, that you know exactly what you're going to say sometimes it's worth practicing

373
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,846
practicing on another employee. Have really clear specific

374
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:05,218
examples because the first thing a person is going to ask as well,

375
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:09,434
Can you give me a specific example of when I've done this, and if you can give them

376
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:15,179
clear specific examples you will obviously have a lot more impact.

377
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,599
And we talked about sandwiching before I would say avoid sandwiching

378
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,883
negative feedback in between 2 pieces of positive feedback, necuase altough it might soften the blow what it

379
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:28,303
generally does it means that the person recieving the feedback will walk away only

380
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:32,519
having heard the positive feedback, they won't actually hear that negative

381
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:38,800
feedback in the middle, and say, Oh well I'm doing a good job.

382
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,130
What is really important too, when giving negative feedback, don't try to soften

383
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:49,195
the blow, be honest, be really constructive.

384
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:54,345
So consider your language. focus on the behavior and the issue, not

385
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:59,130
the person, Ailsa talked about this which is really good advice. And don't make it personal.

386
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:04,093
Make it very clearly about the behavior. Treat the person with dignity at

387
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:06,975
all times. Some people really get off on giving

388
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:11,405
people negative feedback, you need to make sure that you, you're

389
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:14,280
doing it with respect and being respectful, so you're not making people feel

390
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:20,030
stupid the current thing that people do is ask people an entrapment question and

391
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,515
that means asking someone a question they know they don't know the answer to in

392
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:32,758
order to make them feel stupid. I would really suggest that you move away from

393
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:38,100
all the ones from using that approach. Stay in control so I would advise people

394
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,370
to, to not do this when you're really emotional or upset, when the person that you're

395
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:50,430
giving the feedback to is really emotional or upset, and if that person does become upset and emotional,

396
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,600
you should never leave the room or run away.

397
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,746
You should stay with them and you should try and steer the conversation and continue to explain

398
00:28:58,746 --> 00:29:06,554
what's going on and what's expected of them, what they need to do to improve.

399
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:10,088
And so if the situation needs to be escalated and you feel like you can't deal

400
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:13,907
with it yourself then I would definitely suggest to get some help and there's lots

401
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:19,500
of ways you can do that. I'll refer back to the content on the

402
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,322
Business Victoria website. There's some great templates there

403
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:27,770
and some scripts. that have been developed on some common

404
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:32,067
you know, feedback situations. A, a really common one is, if someone is,

405
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,619
is continuely late, there's another script there for if you are making

406
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:40,370
someone redundant. So, they will definitely help you

407
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:45,158
deal with the situation, but I guess from your perspective Ailsa, have I missed

408
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:49,870
anything in terms of what we need to continue giving positive and negative

409
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,491
feedback. &gt;&gt; Well sometimes the only thing I can

410
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:59,296
say is with, with the way you can also give positive feedback is

411
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:01,816
through pay raise [LAUGH] and let them know that you're giving them a pay

412
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:04,980
raise because they've done great job, you know, great work.

413
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,732
Now that is more looking at it perhaps on a longer period of time, some sort of

414
00:30:09,732 --> 00:30:12,850
rewards. I, I actually think you know.

415
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:13,880
&gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a way,

416
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,480
it's just another way of saying hey, actually we really appreciate you and the

417
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,540
work that you've done. So that might be Christmas presents, it

418
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,226
might be, just things like that because often, you know, staff love that.

419
00:30:23,226 --> 00:30:25,910
And love that when they go oh, wow look what they've given me.

420
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,258
Or little, you know little certificates or something like that which can be

421
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:33,306
something quite thoughtful. It doesn't have to cost a fortune and it

422
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:37,674
can mean a lot to people. And the other thing I was just going to

423
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:40,760
say with the tip for giving negative feedback.

424
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,980
Because everyone reacts differently to negative feedback,

425
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,256
and some people are better, better at, handling it,

426
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:50,220
you know, it can be confronting for people.

427
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,540
Is just wanted to say, to allow time. To allow time, not only for the delivery

428
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,320
of the feedback, but also to allow time for people to process it, and react if

429
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,452
they need to. So, you know,

430
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:04,780
for me, it is about, also making the space conducive.

431
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,250
Not having a space where other people can walk in or whatever else, you know.

432
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,801
And, and when you've put in about, you know, respect the person and, and treat

433
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:16,062
them with integrity and, and dignity. And I think part of that also can be

434
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:19,149
just, just be mindful of, of where this is going to be taking place and always

435
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:23,665
have a box of tissues. You know that's great advice.

436
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:27,953
&gt;&gt; You should always do it, do negative feedback communications in a private

437
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:32,177
place where it's, people can't see in, because if, if someone does get upset and

438
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:36,337
they're crying and everyone can see through the window that's obviously very, very awkward for people.

439
00:31:36,337 --> 00:31:42,438
So that's great advice, thanks Ailsa.

440
00:31:42,438 --> 00:31:45,726
&gt;&gt; Alright. So I guess some key tips for tricky

441
00:31:45,726 --> 00:31:51,606
communication situations, even ones that probably some small business owners try to

442
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:57,302
avoid at all costs. That's when you know, you're maybe

443
00:31:57,302 --> 00:32:02,546
having to reduce staff numbers, you might be making people redundant there

444
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:07,898
might be some staff changes or department restructure although, if you're a small business you probably

445
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:12,958
don't have a whole department, [LAUGH] or if it, it it's performance issues here's some key tips that we think

446
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:20,704
are really important fr these communication situations and once again

447
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:25,512
it's about being prepared and having a communication plan.

448
00:32:25,512 --> 00:32:30,127
So, for instance if you're making people redundant you need to think about who

449
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:35,456
you're going to communicate with, at what stages and when.

450
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:39,342
So, having a plan to do that will alleviate a lot of anxiety around that

451
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:42,950
situation. So, being prepared for the hard

452
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,668
questions. So it's really good to sometimes sit down

453
00:32:45,668 --> 00:32:49,124
and go, okay, well, what the really hard questions people are going to ask me

454
00:32:49,124 --> 00:32:52,364
are, and having an answer prepared, and that will make you feel a lot more

455
00:32:52,364 --> 00:32:58,180
comfortable going into those situations. And, once again, be honest.

456
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,852
Honesty is the best policy at all times. And don't tiptoe around people's

457
00:33:01,852 --> 00:33:04,850
concerns. Tell them the truth.

458
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,842
So be open in communicating, involve your people in any decision making.

459
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:14,598
And this is very important that you involve staff in coming up with

460
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:19,301
solutions. Most of the time those who are closest to the situation

461
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:24,517
and they'll probably have the best solutions to these problems.

462
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:29,467
So, they'll also be really much more likely to accept what's going on if they are

463
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:35,617
involved in the decision making process. So, basically, finally, we'd like

464
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:40,105
to say be prepared for the fallout, have answers ready to allay fears, don't run

465
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:44,300
away, stay with your people and they'll respect

466
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,710
you even more and once again, I'll refer back to the Business Victoria website there's some great content

467
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:54,276
there. So, here's a recap on everything that

468
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:59,725
we've been talking about. Communication is a key part of being in

469
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:06,950
business because people work for people and so, business owners this means you.

470
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,876
So, your people work for you. So, it's really about making sure that

471
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:14,320
you communicate with your people every day,

472
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,948
about everything, the rule of thumb here is that there's never too much communication in my book,

473
00:34:19,948 --> 00:34:25,156
so people want to know what's going on if you don't talk to them they're going to

474
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:34,190
find out through the grapevine and if you are the one in control, they there will be a much better outcome.

475
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,664
&gt;&gt; Okay, so communication is directly linked to retention.

476
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:44,929
And the reason for this is, it's about engaging with your people and involving

477
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:51,166
them in what's going on everyday, there'e no use sitting in your office, and working away,

478
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:56,009
and not making, not engaging your people to help you take

479
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:59,070
[INAUDIBLE].

480
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,494
So, communicating with people is obviously going to help them

481
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:08,261
understand how they fit into the bigger picture.

482
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:12,287
And so, I guess I'd like to ask all business owners, how much time you

483
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:16,997
really spend talking to your people and do you think it's enough,

484
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:20,699
so Ailsa, how much time do you spend talking to people in your business?

485
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,832
Well I'm going to have to be really honest here and say probably like every

486
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:32,040
business owner, I could spend more time. But partly that's because,

487
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,284
there is always this conflict between the time that you spend with your staff versus the

488
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:43,570
time that you spend yourself working on or in your business.

489
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,572
And sometimes there's a conflict, sometimes we think oh, you know, it's,

490
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:50,596
all this time is getting away from me that I'm spending on my staff and you

491
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:54,430
feel like it's a waste of time, which is really incorrect.

492
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,202
[LAUGH] So, I guess I just want to acknowledge all those business owners out

493
00:35:57,202 --> 00:36:00,860
there who perhaps feel that as well, which is like ooohh, you know,

494
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,860
I feel it takes up too much of my time to, to manage staff.

495
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,870
Look the bottom line is. It does take up time.

496
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,390
However, you know the time that you actually do invest and spend with your

497
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:15,610
staff will come back in spades. The whole point of having staff is to

498
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,185
kind of help you get out of your business so that you can work on it rather than in

499
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:22,782
it. And, you know, you, you need to invest

500
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:26,555
for this to happen. And, I've certainly seen business owners

501
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:30,449
who havent spent the time you know that, that can, that can it means then that

502
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:35,460
often its quite inefficient, staff doesn't have the direction.

503
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,160
and then you end up do sort of wasting a bit of money and energy on that.

504
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,365
So for me it is a bit of a struggle but I make sure that I,

505
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:45,555
I am organized and spend time to organize what I want the staff to do and

506
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:48,910
to check in to see how they're going because what I've found is if I don't do

507
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,454
that, it is inefficient. And so even though I feel like I'm

508
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:55,941
wasting time I'm not, it's actually an investment.

509
00:36:55,941 --> 00:37:00,773
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's great advice. Talking to staff is an investing in your business

510
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:05,360
and it is quite difficult at times, but it's definitely worth it in the end.

511
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,313
So, the next question, I guess, is, do

512
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:11,905
you really know your people, and do you take the time to listen?

513
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:15,135
So, it's not just about one way communication.

514
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:19,674
It's about, talking to your people. Getting their input, involving them in what's

515
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:23,295
going on. It's really really important to do that.

516
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:26,906
And I think Ailsa mentioned that, in the way that you do

517
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:31,112
communicate with your staff. So, the whole purpose of communication is

518
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:36,720
to make sure that people understand what is expected of them.

519
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,945
And if you do all of these things and you invest the time your going to make sure that

520
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:45,040
your people will stay with you and if they don't they going to get disengaged,

521
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,590
we've heard some stories about managers who don't talk to their staff and impact

522
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:55,655
that it has on morale. So I'm just going to talk very quickly

523
00:37:55,655 --> 00:38:01,036
about why people stay in a business. And the first reason is around empowerment

524
00:38:01,036 --> 00:38:07,187
and trust and the way that you do that is through communication. The second one is around manager

525
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:11,961
relationship and loyalty becuase people work for people, so it's really important that as a manager you spend the

526
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:17,538
time talking to your people. People giving them feedback when they're

527
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:20,786
doing a great job or when we're not doing a great job and this will help

528
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:24,464
retention. it's about ensuring that people

529
00:38:24,464 --> 00:38:28,350
understand the bigger picture and this will help engagement levels and ensuring

530
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,120
that people want to contribute to the success of your business and that's what

531
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:39,164
communication is all about. &gt;&gt; So better results, are underpinned

532
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:46,086
by feedback and recognition, recognition. I think that, that we've made that pretty

533
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:49,059
obvious. So it's really simple.

534
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:56,960
Please go forth and talk to your people everyday about everything.

535
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,055
So, just before I summarize what we've talked about today, Ailsa, I just wanted

536
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:04,835
to ask you is there anything that you think we missed or if you have one top tip

537
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:11,101
that you could give business owners out there about communication,

538
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:15,161
not only are you a business owner you're also a communications expert working in

539
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:20,790
marketing, what would it be? OK, well I think the big one is, is not

540
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:25,660
to assume that your staff understand what you've communicated.

541
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,900
In other words you need to check in that there is an understanding.

542
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,232
One of the things that has sort of come up,

543
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:35,613
while we've been talking that I've been thinking about is, many businesses I

544
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:38,945
speak to, sometimes they, the staff are very passionate and excited and, and very

545
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:42,032
committed, but they might be putting their energies perhaps into the wrong

546
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:45,119
areas, and so they're actually going off on a slight tangent to perhaps what

547
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,946
they're meant to be doing. So I think that's probably a big thing is

548
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:54,274
really just checking in to make sure that the staff is very clear on what you

549
00:39:54,274 --> 00:39:58,310
expect of them, on what you want them to be doing.

550
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,472
And so then, that needs to be done on a regular basis because if it's not, you

551
00:40:01,472 --> 00:40:04,889
know they can think, you know they can be working, thinking they're doing a great

552
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:10,013
job but it's in the wrong direction. And, and you know sometimes business

553
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:13,481
owners don't want to always pull back the reigns but you need to and ultimately the

554
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:16,643
staff will thank you for, for keeping them on on track

555
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:19,652
so that you set them up to win as an employee rather than set them up to fail because they are not

556
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:26,308
doing what they are supposed to be doing. That's great advice.

557
00:40:26,308 --> 00:40:31,065
So how do you do that in your business like, do you have monthly staff meetings

558
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:38,230
or do you do it more informally? &gt;&gt; Look, I pretty much have a,

559
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,650
my system is that, whenever staff come in.

560
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,386
Because I have a lot of part time staff as opposed to full time staff,

561
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:46,520
I really do a check in.

562
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,040
I actually give them, a bit of an up to date on what's been happening in the

563
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,430
business. Because I'm sure, like many other

564
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,320
business owners. Gee, you know,

565
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,460
one week in small business, a lot can happen.

566
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,350
So it's a case of really bringing them up to speed.

567
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,300
And sometimes, you know, we do change direction, because we can.

568
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,788
Because we're flexible, we're small, and we are able to, you know?

569
00:41:03,788 --> 00:41:07,730
You know, adapt to the market. So I, bring them up to speed.

570
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,732
and then, sort of relate how perhaps the changes in the business, might then affect

571
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:16,130
what they've been doing. And I, you know, reiterate exactly,

572
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,228
well, you know, you were working on this. This is now no longer such a priority so

573
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:23,090
I'd like you to work on this. Or whatever it happens to be, so I give a

574
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,290
bit of rational for perhaps a change of direction, and I do that every time

575
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,690
because I've just learned that if I don't sometimes, whilst I think it's all clear,

576
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,840
I think I've, you know, been a perfect communicator and the message has come

577
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:38,262
across. So I also go through a bit of a, we

578
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,860
almost do a daily, you know, sort of, what are we going to

579
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,205
do today? So that's all very clear and so that

580
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:47,615
staff, if I'm out and about and not here all the time, they've got something

581
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:52,780
written down that they're very clear that this is what's to be done.

582
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,524
Yeah, that's great advice. thank you Ailsa.

583
00:41:56,524 --> 00:42:02,788
So I guess, in summary, having the right communication processes in systems

584
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:08,212
in your business is really really important. And whether they're formal; informal,

585
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:11,276
you know, all of these tools will help

586
00:42:11,276 --> 00:42:16,334
you, better manage what's going on, making sure people know what's expected

587
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,250
of them, when they're performing and when they're

588
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,890
not. So whether it's a performance or review

589
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,870
process, an induction process, in a staff manual,

590
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:28,353
or where it's just a general email announcement.

591
00:42:28,353 --> 00:42:32,160
It's really important to have those processes in place.

592
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,917
I've said this about ten times I think being prepared and having an agenda is

593
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:42,955
key to successful communication. Be ready for the hard questions and don't

594
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:47,995
hide and don't shift away from situations where you know there's going to be conflict

595
00:42:47,995 --> 00:42:51,990
or it's going to make people uncomfortable. You, you are the business owner.

596
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:55,702
You need to stick up to these situations and manage them head on, otherwise

597
00:42:55,702 --> 00:43:00,330
it'll just come back to bite you in the end. Practice makes perfect.

598
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:05,433
So, once again, doing this every day it's going to, you're going to get better and

599
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:09,798
better at it. It might feel a bit funny to begin with

600
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:13,300
but if you keep doing it the time it will get easier and easier.

601
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,250
Choose the right type of communication for the situation so whether it be an

602
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:22,975
announcement or a letter or whatever it needs to be you need to make sure that

603
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:28,750
your communication's tailored to the outcome.

604
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:33,510
And finally, face to face, we suggest its always best, how much, how many times have

605
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:39,550
you sent an email to someone and its either got lost in translation;

606
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:44,140
things have been taken out of context. It's a lot better to walk over

607
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,880
to the person's desk and tell them face to face or it even pick up the phone.

608
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,891
And I think that, that's really about it.

609
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:59,508
So, basically, go forth and talk to your people.

610
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:03,473
&gt;&gt; Okay, great, thanks so much Ailsa and Emily, we've got a lot of questions and

611
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:06,774
so, I encourage you to keep on sending them

612
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:11,699
through and I'll put as many of them as we have time to, to the pair.

613
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:15,703
So first of all, we've got a bit of an interesting one from Michael.

614
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:20,311
He said this is the age old show stopper, how to deal with a staff member,

615
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:23,890
female, who has B.O. [LAUGH] Okay.

616
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:30,850
Yeah, this a tough one and it is a situation that I've had before.

617
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:37,210
So my advice would be, I would get another female to speak to her.

618
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:43,630
It might be a little confronting if a male sat her down and gave her some feedback,

619
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:48,530
but I would sit down and just explain to her about personal hygiene and

620
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:53,430
the importance of personal hygiene and very gently suggest that, that she needs

621
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:59,470
to wear deodorant. &gt;&gt; Could, could I add to that?

622
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,422
&gt;&gt; I would also, in the staff bathrooms, I would actually provide

623
00:45:03,422 --> 00:45:08,742
deodorant and sort of have it there and with just a, a little sign, sort of like

624
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:14,910
you know, something sort of um, 'keep fresh.'

625
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,239
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Keep Fresh.

626
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:17,436
I like that. There you go.

627
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:19,200
[LAUGH] Yeah, or something along the lines.

628
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,043
I mean, if you, if humours, well, yeah. It's probably better to keep it straight.

629
00:45:23,043 --> 00:45:24,400
&gt;&gt; Really. Okay.

630
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,290
So some sweet smelling tips there. And we've got another question from

631
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,956
Melissa. She says, how do you deal with a staff

632
00:45:31,956 --> 00:45:35,600
member that ignores or disregards negative feedback?

633
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:40,865
Yes, this is common one I guess if someone ignores negative feedback and it's

634
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:45,968
having an impact on their performance you may need to escalate that to a more

635
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:52,550
formal performance management process, where you would give them

636
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:57,362
warnings for failure to improve. So, it may be that you need to sit down

637
00:45:57,362 --> 00:46:01,826
and formally go through things and put in things in writing and let them to know

638
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:06,650
what the consequences are if they don't improve their behavior because if there

639
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:13,432
aren't consequences then generally people won't change and they will disregard it.

640
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:20,190
Okay, a bit of a practical issue from Scott.

641
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,210
He wants to know whether there's any tool or software that can help with task

642
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:30,150
management on an ongoing basis. &gt;&gt; Hmm, task management as being like a

643
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:33,466
project management tool? &gt;&gt; I'm not sure,

644
00:46:33,466 --> 00:46:37,024
Scott, hasn't

645
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:40,550
&gt;&gt; given us further details. If he wants to send through more but,

646
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:45,800
perhaps if you can guess for now. I'm happy to just say look seriously

647
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,700
even just you know Microsoft Outlook if you're on PC, just the, just the

648
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:54,130
tasks list can be a ripper. You know something like that or if you're on

649
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:56,818
Google Docs and you actually have a sort of a just even a menu or sort of you know

650
00:46:56,818 --> 00:47:00,728
who's doing what. I mean that just keeping it really

651
00:47:00,728 --> 00:47:06,034
simple, can be a very good way of, you know, just keeping up, keeping a bit

652
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:09,000
of a track of it. It's not anything sophisticated but,

653
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,114
it's, it's there and available to most businesses.

654
00:47:12,114 --> 00:47:15,306
&gt;&gt; Okay and we've had a tip from a listener, Michael who says TRELLO is a

655
00:47:15,306 --> 00:47:18,752
great free browser task management software.

656
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,100
T.R.E.L.L.O he says.

657
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,610
&gt;&gt;Wow.. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. There you go.

658
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,400
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [LAUGH] So we've got

659
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,428
another, question from Kate. She says coming in as a new manager to

660
00:47:29,428 --> 00:47:33,775
introduce and develop new systems, how do you go about introducing those to

661
00:47:33,775 --> 00:47:40,562
existing staff to get them on board and view them as positive not negative?

662
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:44,786
Sure, I guess this is really around change management and the first step in

663
00:47:44,786 --> 00:47:49,736
change management is helping people to understand why you need to change and

664
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:57,220
I guess the whole scene around, what's in it for me, is a good way to do that.

665
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:02,476
So involving them from the very beginning in a new project getting their input,

666
00:48:02,476 --> 00:48:07,075
getting them to help come up with solutions will enable them to I guess more easily accept

667
00:48:07,075 --> 00:48:13,791
what's going on is my best advice.. &gt;&gt; And I'll just add to that by also

668
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:18,244
you know talking with the staff and finding out a little bit about them and

669
00:48:18,244 --> 00:48:25,742
potentially what might be their barriers to the change and being really honest

670
00:48:25,742 --> 00:48:28,891
about that, I think acknowledging you know, because with change, there, there,

671
00:48:28,891 --> 00:48:33,150
there's always some you know, negative sides as well as some positive sides.

672
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,940
So I think it's about being you know, open and honest and acknowledging the

673
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,775
negative because sometimes when we're bring in change, we just keep trying

674
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:42,558
to, you know, promote the benefits of it, but people,

675
00:48:42,558 --> 00:48:45,548
you know, people, in their minds, know the negatives, so by, sometimes by just

676
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,262
getting those out of the way, acknowledging them, then you can, really

677
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:52,095
can move forward to some of the positive stuff.

678
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:57,900
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's great, Ailsa. now I've got a question from Melissa.

679
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,971
She says, how do you deal with a staff member that ignores or disregards

680
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:05,650
negative feedback?

681
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,536
Did we already have that question?

682
00:49:08,536 --> 00:49:12,514
&gt;&gt; I think I was going to say we've already answered that question.

683
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:15,877
&gt;&gt; Okay I'm repeating myself okay, that's alright we've got lots more here

684
00:49:15,877 --> 00:49:19,183
to go we've got a question from Leo he wants to know are teams rewards

685
00:49:19,183 --> 00:49:25,640
appropriate, as well as individuals. Yeah, I would definitely encourage team

686
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,965
based awards, you could come up with an incentive program that rewarded the whole team not

687
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:35,765
just individuals I think that's a great way to build that sense of team ensure

688
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:40,040
that people are alligned to the outcome and to your business strategy, so I would

689
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:47,783
definitely encourage that. &gt;&gt; Yeah and I would agree as long as

690
00:49:47,783 --> 00:49:52,339
you know, the team is working together, to achieve a goal, because

691
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:56,623
sometimes I, I think it can back fire when there's sort of um, if

692
00:49:56,623 --> 00:50:01,247
certain people working really hard, and then, if then there's a generic award

693
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:05,871
across the company, you know, based on a few people's kind of performance, I think

694
00:50:05,871 --> 00:50:14,858
that's when it can backfire. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I totally agree, it needs to

695
00:50:14,858 --> 00:50:22,461
ensure that everybody is engaged. And rewarded for whatever the incentive is.

696
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:25,824
&gt;&gt; Okay that's interesting and Josie wants to know how do you manage staff

697
00:50:25,824 --> 00:50:29,700
that don't directly report to you however you've been asked to manage them by your

698
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:35,371
direct report regarding projects when a direct manager is not there.

699
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:41,330
Hmm, that's probably a common issue, and that's I guess really around

700
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:47,296
influencing people. And then, I guess having the skills to, to

701
00:50:47,296 --> 00:50:52,236
try and get people on board with projects when they are not necessarily your employee

702
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:59,170
it, it can be quite difficult. maybe they could speak to the persons

703
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:03,400
manager and ask for help. Getting that person to help them with

704
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,315
that project, it's a bit of a tricky one Ailsa, what do you think?

705
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:11,095
&gt;&gt; What I think it's that whoever has got the authority needs to endorse the

706
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:15,379
role that they're putting them into and even though they're sort of saying well

707
00:51:15,379 --> 00:51:19,348
look they don't have to directly report to you I think they're just saying to

708
00:51:19,348 --> 00:51:23,443
re-clarify what they're expecting from both staff members in that situation

709
00:51:23,443 --> 00:51:32,150
rather than just throw it on to someone who's the subordinate and say, sort it out.

710
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,150
You know, I don't think that's, that's I don't think that's fair.

711
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,710
So I think it's about re-communicating if, if the position has changed so that

712
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,430
there's a different reporting structure or there's a different accountability

713
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,090
structure, whatever. That needs to be communicated by the

714
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,375
person who ultimately has the responsibility.

715
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:51,300
Ok. That's helpful.

716
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,204
And Sharon wants to know how to deal with, it's quite simple from Sharon actually,

717
00:51:55,204 --> 00:51:59,651
but tricky, how do you deal with staff who don't get on?

718
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:06,914
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How long is a piece of string? I guess that's a really tough one.

719
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:13,716
Sometime syou may need to get the staff member into a room and do a bit of a

720
00:52:13,716 --> 00:52:18,473
mediation session to say "Ok, guys, lets talk about the issues here and if you are

721
00:52:18,473 --> 00:52:23,159
upset with each other, what's going on," and try to get them to agree to disagree,

722
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:29,910
or agree to work together. I found in the past,

723
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:33,189
sometimes that works but I guess the two people need to be willing

724
00:52:33,189 --> 00:52:35,952
that. If it's about behaviour and people

725
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:41,214
behaving inappropriately, I guess, are going to deal with that separately.

726
00:52:41,214 --> 00:52:44,624
&gt;&gt; Yeah look I'd have to agree with what Emily is saying, the only thing I'd

727
00:52:44,624 --> 00:52:48,144
add to it is, it is about identifying, you know, is it just a personality clash

728
00:52:48,144 --> 00:52:52,920
or, or is there some sort of behavior

729
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,860
that one of the the parties is doing, that is unacceptable.

730
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,321
It sort of identifying what's going on there. Some team building can always be a

731
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:02,861
good thing, you know social functions outside the

732
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:04,440
office can be good, you know.

733
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,283
You might want get in someone that can run some of those, that's often proven to

734
00:53:08,283 --> 00:53:12,252
be very, very effective. But look, at the end of the day I think

735
00:53:12,252 --> 00:53:15,700
it is really important I know that there's, there's 2 sides to it.

736
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,598
One is, you know, having diversity can be fantastic for problem solving and things

737
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:21,554
like that. But in small business, you know, having a

738
00:53:21,554 --> 00:53:26,000
personality clash, if its a small staff, you know its a nightmare.

739
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,762
So I think sometimes you almost need to perhaps be really upfront to both of them

740
00:53:29,762 --> 00:53:33,220
and say look, this is, you know, this is a bit of a

741
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:36,322
nightmare and it's putting the business in a bit of

742
00:53:36,322 --> 00:53:39,216
a tricky situation. So have you got some solutions for how we

743
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,080
can work through this? You know?

744
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,372
Yeah, anyway, and I, I could go harsher but I won't [LAUGH].

745
00:53:45,372 --> 00:53:46,996
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]. &gt;&gt; We've got a tip here from one of

746
00:53:46,996 --> 00:53:50,654
our listeners Michael, and he said, he's actually had an excellent result in a

747
00:53:50,654 --> 00:53:55,056
situation where, the business culture included a large amount of interpersonal

748
00:53:55,056 --> 00:54:00,695
conflict between staff. And what he did was get a professional

749
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:04,215
trainer to assist with and had excellent results in cultural change and it was

750
00:54:04,215 --> 00:54:07,625
assisted with funding through the enterprise connect and also skills for

751
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:12,660
growth. &gt;&gt; Oh, there you go, brilliant.

752
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,100
&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's a good tip. I'll give you a final question here.

753
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,492
Martine says she thinks she communicates quite well with her staff and when she

754
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:25,340
asks for feedback it's always rather positive.

755
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,130
But she still continues to have some recurring issues.

756
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:31,924
How does she really know if it's the way she communicates or if

757
00:54:31,924 --> 00:54:35,781
the staff are just not listening. &gt;&gt; Good question.

758
00:54:35,781 --> 00:54:39,919
&gt;&gt; Like. &gt;&gt; I guess a tool to get

759
00:54:39,919 --> 00:54:47,309
some, some feedback from her staff maybe a 360 review.

760
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:51,782
So, she may if she is a small business owner be able to engage a consultant to come out

761
00:54:51,782 --> 00:54:56,184
and do a 360 review process so she can get them balanced feedback, a lot of the time

762
00:54:56,184 --> 00:55:00,586
if it's your manager is really scary to give them really honest feedback because

763
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:08,804
you're worried about the implications about giving that feedback.

764
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:14,890
So to use a 360 review process you can get that feedback in a confidential manner,

765
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:19,789
where people will feel more comfortable doing that but if that's not an option because

766
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:24,333
it might be too expensive or it's just not something can be done I would encourage

767
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:28,664
her to be more direct with her staff and say I want you to give feedback and I'm not going

768
00:55:28,664 --> 00:55:34,513
to get upset when you do so. And give

769
00:55:34,513 --> 00:55:39,943
them permission to tell her the truth. &gt;&gt; I was just going to say that another

770
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:43,345
that say we do in, in, with marketing is when you really want to know what your

771
00:55:43,345 --> 00:55:46,963
customers think of you, is usually what does work, is that you get an independent

772
00:55:46,963 --> 00:55:52,550
person to ring up and and have a confidential discussion.

773
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,972
And then, you know, later on, you may ask the, the person, is it okay

774
00:55:55,972 --> 00:55:59,980
if this information is fed back without revealing name?

775
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,340
Or is it okay if it's fed back revealing name.

776
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:06,372
And often, what can happen is when that is initiated by the business, it's

777
00:56:06,372 --> 00:56:10,089
incredible how people are, are then is going, oh wow, they really want to

778
00:56:10,089 --> 00:56:14,832
improve this, how they then will perhaps provide honest

779
00:56:14,832 --> 00:56:18,504
feedback and, and then what can happen is it can be delivered to the business owner

780
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:21,852
in a way that can be heard without the staff actually having to deliver that

781
00:56:21,852 --> 00:56:28,710
themselves. Okay.

782
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:35,730
Yeah, it sounds like there's a few solutions to that one, so good luck Martine.

783
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:40,350
Alright well that's all the questions we have time for although there will be a

784
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:44,760
chance if you want to turn to Twitter using the hashtag #talk to staff

785
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:52,130
to ask a few more questions. But for the webinar section I'd just like

786
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:56,442
to really thank everyone for participating and thanks for all your

787
00:56:56,442 --> 00:57:03,590
brilliant questions. That's been really insightful.

788
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:07,110
And, thanks to our partner for today's webinar

789
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,773
Business Victoria. You will have seen a few links up on the

790
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:13,510
screen during this seminar to the Business Victoria website.

791
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,780
So I'd encourage you to go and have a look at that.

792
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,305
There's a lot of information on there and

793
00:57:18,305 --> 00:57:21,477
when you get your slide pack, you can just click through to those links and

794
00:57:21,477 --> 00:57:24,850
find more information on some of those issues.

795
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:29,547
So thank you very much, thank you obviously to Ailsa and Amy for sharing

796
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:34,315
your expertise and to everyone for joining in

797
