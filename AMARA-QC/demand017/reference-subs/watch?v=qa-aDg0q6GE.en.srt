Hi, I'm Gidon from Steamy'sCleaning and Restoration Services.

4
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:19,234
And I'm going to show you how to remove ared wine spill from your carpet.

5
00:00:19,234 --> 00:00:23,259
It is important to do this as soon as theincident happens.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,787
Otherwise, you will need to call aprofessional carpet cleaning company.

7
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:30,750
Down here, I've got two different type of carpets.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,809
One, is a well treated nylon carpet, theother one is a good quality wool carpet.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:46,961
Now, I'm going to spill on the nylon oneand that would be on the wool one.

10
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:50,968
What we need to do is to blot the carpet.

11
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,588
As you can see, the wool one absorbed the wine straight away.

12
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:58,546
With the nylon, it is sitting on top of the nylon.

13
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:02,919
What we need to do, we need to blot the stains first.

14
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:04,955

15
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:07,059
Now, do not rub the carpet.

16
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:12,410
If you're going to rub the carpet, you'regoing to create a non-reversible damage to it.

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:17,214
Then, we take salt and we put some salt over the stains.

18
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:26,210
After waiting for a few minutes, we take a vacuum cleaner and we suck all the salt out.

19
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:32,464
By this stage, most of the wine should be absorbed by the salt.

20
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,671
Now, if you can still see the stain,

21
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:41,885
we take a cup of water and we put somebicarbonated soda into it, mix it up,

22
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:44,885
and then, spread on the stain.

23
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:51,990
Then, we take a sponge and we try and absorb as much as we can.

24
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,841
Then, we take a cloth again, a clean one and blot again.

25
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:01,903
As you can see, those two stains are gone now.

26
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:15,081
