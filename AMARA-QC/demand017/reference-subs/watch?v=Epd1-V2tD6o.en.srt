3
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:14,250
<i> which is “How to Deal With </i>
Customers Who Won’t Pay”

4
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:20,285
<i>I think you agree is a pretty important </i>
topic for all SME’s

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,429
<i>My name is Cara Waters.</i>
I’m the editor of Smart Company

6
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:30,506
<i>and today I’m joined with- virtually, </i>
because they are in different place to me.

7
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:37,400
<i>But, Andrew Baird who is a principal </i>
in Accounting and Business Advisory at WHK

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,714
and Emily Jaksh whose title is 
Head Guru at HR Gurus.

9
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:50,790
<i>So for the webinar, if you haven’t </i>
logged into one of these before,

10
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,593
<i>just to let you know the way to </i>
participate is, firstly by listening.

11
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:55,609
<i>The audio will automatically be streamed </i>
through your computer speakers,

12
00:00:56,684 --> 00:01:06,154
<i>and another way is by Twitter.</i>

13
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:11,596
<i>So you can use the @SmartCompany or the #smartcowebinar.</i>

14
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:19,401
<i>Now, the major way though if you want to get really interactive</i>

15
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:23,863
is to ask questions via the questions pane, which is,*

16
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:26,157
<i>you’ll see on your computer screen.</i>

17
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:28,461
<i>What you’ll do is you type in your questions</i>

18
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:31,105
<i>in the space at bottom and click on send.</i>

19
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:34,876
<i>I’ll then be asking our two presentors</i>

20
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:37,441
<i>Andrew and Emily all your queries.</i>

21
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:42,175
<i>So, I really encourage you to send them through because it is an,</i>

22
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:42,511
<i>important topic and something</i>

23
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:48,745
<i>that I’m sure a lot of you do have questions about.</i>

24
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:55,227
<i>And, also, I'd just like to thank our partners for today’s webinar,</i>

<i>providing Big Help for Small Business.</i>

27
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:09,768
<i>And one final reminder before I hand over to Andrew and Emily is that,</i>

28
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:09,958
<i>you don’t have to worry about furiously copying down notes</i>

29

32
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,511
<i>or feel free to take notes if you want to.</i>

33
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:31,665
<i>So, I'll now hand over and to let them introduce</i>

34
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,538
<i>themselves properly, to Andrew and Emily</i>

35
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:37,812
[Andrew] <i>Great. Thanks Cara. My name is Andrew Baird.</i>

<i>I'm a principal with WHK -- and I'm specializing in accounting and advisory services to SME market.</i>

[Emily]<i>And my name is Emily Jaksh and I'm also with the SME market and --</i>

38
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:59,146
[Andrew] <i>And today, Emily and I are going to be talking to you about</i>

39
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:04,105
<i>how to deal with customers who won't pay.And it's all -- that we're going to talk</i>

40
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:06,087
<i>and how to get them to pay.</i>

41
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:11,454
<i>First of all we're going to be talking about key cashflow issues,</i>

42
00:03:11,454 --> 00:03:16,001
<i>and it's effect in businesses.</i>

43
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:22,716
<i>How to avoid common cashflow mistakes,and tips for preventing customers</i>

44
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:27,710
<i> becoming late payers, and ways to deal with late paying customers.</i>

45
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:34,099
<i>And in this --, in the introduction plate,we're more than happy to</i>

46
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,090
<i>take questions through it -- as we go.</i>

47
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,318
<i>-- it's topics that come up orquestions that come up.</i>

48
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,200
<i>Emily and I, we're more than happy to -- those questions from --.</i>

49
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:53,744
<i>So, real quickly, there's so many causesof cashflow --, and issues, in business.</i>

50
00:03:53,744 --> 00:04:00,604
<i>Unplanned capital purchases, debtors not paid, not managing your stock,</i>

51
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:04,705
<i>over spending, lack of systemsin purchases, too much bank debt,</i>

52
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:09,295
<i>inefficient operations, poor planning, poor record keeping,</i>

53
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,603
<i>and -- creditors.</i>

54
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:12,697
<i>This could go on and on.</i>

55
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:16,109
<i>In the business side, what are some of the things that</i>

56
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,185
<i>you've experienced for the -- cashflow issues, and --</i>

57
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:28,207
[Emily] <i>I guess the key to -- process, -- everyday.</i>

58
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,903
<i> It just kind of gets away from you. </i>

59
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:36,631
<i>So, -- small business owners is that you need to have a clear process,</i>

60
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:40,553
<i>a good invoice and --, good relationships, and --.</i>

61
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:46,463
[Andrew]<i> Yes, so is there planning involved in the -- cashflow?</i>

62
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,589
[Emily] <i>Yes, definitely.</i>

63
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:48,451
[Andrew]<i> Yeah.</i>

64
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:56,245
<i> And so as I am in the business which provides services to other and --,</i>

65
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:59,255
<i>so that is the key issue for you?</i>

66
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:09,071
[Emily] <i>It is a big issue to us. -- we've got actually today -- days if you -- every single day.</i>

67
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:13,361
<i> I used to have a manual spreadsheet that I'll use.</i>

68
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:19,372
<i>Now I use -- which is good. </i>

69
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:21,613
<i> It's automated to help -- couple entry involved.</i>

70
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:26,331
<i>Now, we veered away from that, we -- our cash flow.</i>

71
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:30,992
[Andrew]<i> Yeah. So, if we just move on, even I,</i>

72
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:34,911
<i>we could get top three causes of cash flow issues in small businesses.</i>

73
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:40,917
<i>It's really poor debtor management, lack of planning, and poor record keeping.</i>

74
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,892
<i> Those are what we're seeing.</i>

75
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:45,606
<i> It's what everyone needs to give some time to consider.</i>

76
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:47,143
[Emily] <i> Sure. --</i>

77
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:50,802
[Andrew]<i> So, moving now, how to avoid...</i>

78
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:52,585
[Cara] <i> Andrew and Emily, sorry, sorry to interrupt there.</i>

79
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,850
<i>We're just getting feedback. </i>

80
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,476
<i>People are having trouble listening to you.</i>

81
00:05:56,476 --> 00:06:00,528
<i>Are you able to speak into the microphone as we were, as we were doing before? </i>

82
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:04,273
<i>Apologies everyone.</i>

83
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:07,564
[Andrew] <i> That's okay, let's see how we go now. </i>

84
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:09,599
<i>So, let's talk about how we can...</i>

85
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,993
[Cara] <i> It's better from my end. So, yes, we're getting confirmation.</i>

86
00:06:13,993 --> 00:06:15,292
<i>People are preferring that. </i>

87
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,380
<i>And Emily as well, when it's you're turn,</i>

88
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,678
<i>if you just speak, speak better, more clearly into the microphone.</i>

89
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:21,902
<i>Thank you.</i>

90
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:24,377
[Andrew] <i>Sorry. So, let's have a chat --</i>

91
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:28,096
<i>that how we can avoid some of the cashflow mistakes.</i>

92
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,515
<i>Similar things and things that we've come up with -- </i>

93
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:35,799
<i>might be sure that there's clear roles and responsibility in the business,</i>

94
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:40,948
<i> good stock management, good recording,regular cash flow forecasting,</i>

95
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:45,527
<i>refinancing early, customer selections, choosing your customers,</i>

96
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:51,586
<i>having a really good systems and processes around debt management. </i>

97
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:58,078
<i>-- on information or you were usingspreadsheets to manage your business.</i>

98
00:06:58,078 --> 00:06:58,799
[Emily] <i> Yeah.</i>

99
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,800
[Andrew] <i> And, so, tell us a little bit about that </i>

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,455
<i>and what prompted you to move to Zero.</i>

101
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:10,007
[Emily] <i>Sure. But, initially, I'm using a spreadsheet to -- when people pay. </i>

102
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:13,455
<i>If they haven't paid me -- overdue,</i>

103
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:25,067
<i>I will -- which is a lot of work because you have to -- between bank statements,</i>

104
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,573
<i>the one I'm making, and the spreadsheets --. </i>

105
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:31,870
<i>And then when -- introduced me to Zero,</i>

106
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:39,656
<i>which is a fantastic tool because it gives you real-time information -- your bank statement.</i>

107
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:44,130
<i>So, you can -- and say, "You haven't paid."</i>

108
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,425
<i>And everyday you can be on top of it, which is really important in my reports.</i>

109
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:57,186
<i>The other day, we were actually --, which -- not really helpful.</i>

110
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,698
[Andrew] <i> So, you can do it -- Zero and you automatically...</i>

111
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:03,282
[Emily] <i>Yeah.</i>

112
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,884
[Andrew] <i>You can say, without having gone to the bank who's paid and who hasn't.</i>

113
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,458
[Emily] <i>Exactly. It's like, everyday you -- your account.</i>

114
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:12,520
<i>It -- your bank statement so you can see</i>

115
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,505
<i>what money is going out, coming in, and whether it's overcharge.</i>

116
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:22,116
<i>It's also a simple -- people who are paid.</i>

117
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:25,925
<i>[Andrew] So, it really makes cash flow management, and cash flow planning,</i>

118
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:26,732
<i>and data -- is that?</i>

119
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:28,631
[Emily] <i> Definitely.</i>

120
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,521
[Andrew] <i>Yeah, yeah. One thing that we see,</i>

121
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:36,411
<i>and we've got a lot of there on the slides with -- it's clearly -- all customers.</i>

122
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,300
<i>We see a lot of businesses that come to usthat haven't done any planning,</i>

123
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:45,452
<i>and I'm looking the -- when it's- Am I taking too much? </i>

124
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:49,827
<i>So, that cashflow forecasting and regular forecasts start --.</i>

125
00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:54,567
<i>Often it's too late or by the time you realize</i>

126
00:08:54,567 --> 00:09:00,943
<i>that you're in a cash -- it's too late to go to the bank and ask them to --</i>

127
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:11,631
[Emily] <i>-- to that initially and then -- everybody's skillset, -- finance. </i>

128
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:16,368
<i>So, we've -- and then you realize</i>

129
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:19,645
<i>how much you have -- really into what --that people file -- is a lack of cash --.</i>

130
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:30,949
<i>So, definitely, all capital they had not -- hand,</i>

131
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:37,508
<i> and pertaining that will get better is paramount.</i>

132
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:42,869
[Andrew]<i> Absolutely, having the wrong information...</i>

133
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:47,780
[Cara] <i> I've got one question for thetwo of you already that's coming from Jan.</i>

134
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,143
<i>Jan wants to know what's the difference between a budget and a forecast.</i>

135
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:54,885
[Andrew] <i>That's a good question, Jan.</i>

136
00:09:54,885 --> 00:10:00,549
<i>For me, and if I'll answer it, let me go first on this.</i>

137
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:05,661
<i>Let me -- you something that we would say a business doing it, starting it,</i>

138
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:14,210
<i>and really setting the goals for maybe the next 12 months or maybe as far as</i>

139
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:20,519
<i>maybe 3 years and using this as a toolto track the performance of the business.</i>

140
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,292
<i>That's setting yourself a good 12-month goal.</i>

141
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:26,672
<i>A forecast, we would say, is something you update and regulate.</i>

142
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:32,858
<i>So, we -- to a budget instead of probably sometime between now and June.</i>

143
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:37,728
<i>So, they've got a clear picture of, and where I want the business to be</i>

144
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:42,705
<i>in the next 12 months and then update that on a regular basis.</i>

145
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:47,777
<i>And to forecast at where you're actually -- of all.</i>

146
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:53,050
<i>And certainly cashflow forecast is something quite different</i>

147
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,669
<i>and that's something that we would encourage clients to do.</i>

148
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:02,030
<i>Setup this weekly tool that's gonna show us what's coming in this way,</i>

149
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,386
<i>what's going out, and try to forecast that out as far as possible.</i>

150
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:11,098
<i>And -- which will show -- cashflow whole</i>

151
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:18,355
<i>or -- might be three or six months down the track and really use it</i>

152
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:21,645
<i>as new tool for -- the cashflow --.</i>

153
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:21,837
[Emily] <i>Yeah and I would say that -- weekly to help with that cashflow and --.</i>

154
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:22,108
<i>Every week we sit down and talk about, "Okay, what's with the net cashflow?"</i>

155
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:38,171
<i>"Are we having problems?"</i>

156
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:41,516
<i>"What is coming in versus what is going out?"</i>

157
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:44,568
<i>Just to keep the -- on it and so that we'd both --.</i>

158
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:55,317
[Andrew] <i>Yeah. Growing businesses, really, they need cash.</i>

159
00:11:55,317 --> 00:12:03,540
<i>So, that cashflow forecasting is advised to any budget. So, just moving on to --</i>

160
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,356
[Cara] <i> Okay, sorry before you move on there -</i>

161
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:08,885
<i>just Emily, people are still having trouble hearing you.</i>

162
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:13,297
<i>Sorry, if it's possible to speak more directly into the microphone.</i>

163
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,919
<i>And I do have another question,</i>

164
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,230
<i>which is from Hannah, who says, "We have suppliers who use Zero,"</i>

165
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,006
<i>but they're mainly sole traders.Is it good for larger businesses?</i>

166
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:25,896
<i>Hannah's currently using a spreadsheet</i>

167
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:30,648
<i>which shows 1200 customers and she wants to know, would Zero support that?</i>

168
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:33,389
[Emily] <i> Yes. --</i>

169
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:40,117
[Andrew] <i>Yeah. So, Hannah, right --</i>

170
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:41,920
<i>manage a business of that sort in a spreadsheet,</i>

171
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,240
<i> I think that's fantastic.</i>

172
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,677
<i>But, I think it is time to move to a- to move that to system Zero.</i>

173
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:50,590
<i> It's got a really good capability and it's-</i>

174
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:57,175
<i> We have a number of clients which are small business, it's not a one-man show.</i>

175
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,313
[Emily] <i>Right.</i>

176
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:01,044
[Andrew] <i> So, I think there are some limitations</i>

177
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:05,746
<i>with the number of employees that can be on the -- version,</i>

178
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:07,927
<i>but there's a whole lot of pluggins.</i>

179
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:13,365
<i>But payroll and stock management and project management -- </i>

180
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:20,870
<i>Zero and -- on it and logs off -- uses it and --.</i>

181
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:27,315
[Emily] <i> I think that the best thing that you're gonna encounter -- </i>

182
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:45,152
<i>It's not like me to buy something and -- updated it. It really quite --.</i>

183
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,707
<i>You don't really that much training once you put it up.</i>

184
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:49,625
<i>It's just gonna run itself.</i>

185
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,088
[Andrew] <i> Yes, definitely. They're very intuitive and very easy to use.</i>

186
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:54,334
[Emily] <i> Yes.</i>

187
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,674
[Andrew] <i>And widely quickbooks -- would be able to cross.</i>

188
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:00,974
<i>This is not an advancement to Zero -- </i>

189
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:07,309
<i>I guess lot of us admire quicken -- </i>

190
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:17,358
<i>but certainly we all find it, very easy to use and it's --. It's fantastic, it's -- and --.</i>

191
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:21,460
<i>So, moving on now,</i>

192
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:28,236
<i>so, our top three issues and -- I, come up with avoiding cashflow mistakes.</i>

193
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:28,525
<i>Robust debtor management process, it's so important to know.</i>

194
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:32,815
[Emily] <i>Yes.</i>

195
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:33,103
[Andrew] <i> And we'll talk more in detailabout that with examples of good crisis</i>

196
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:33,935
<i> and give you some examples about how to deal with problem, problem payers.</i>

197
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:43,825
<i>That cashflow planning and forecasting,</i>

198
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:51,177
<i> we keep talking about that over and over and an up to date financial information.</i>

199
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:56,804
<i> It's no good waiting until September, October, or December, </i>

200
00:14:56,804 --> 00:15:01,344
<i>after you -- when you get your tax return or your accounts to your accountant</i>

201
00:15:01,344 --> 00:15:03,992
<i> to look to see what the- </i>

202
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:06,180
<i>Hey, business has been pretty good!</i>

203
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,045
<i> That real-time information is absolutely pretty cool.</i>

204
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:15,471
<i>Cashflow, it's the outcome of the actions</i>

205
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,001
<i> and the activities that's happening in your business. </i>

206
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,052
<i>So, we're actually in business tonight, mate.</i>

207
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:24,276
<i>So, the -- of that is ultimately cash in the bank</i>

208
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:28,833
<i>and if we're not monitoring the activities</i>

209
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,601
<i> and the actions that we take in our business --,</i>

210
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:39,408
<i>then we're gonna end up with cashflow problems, unless you're really lucky.</i>

211
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:51,062
[Emily] <i> And I'll kinda agree with that -- more money in the bank than you really do.</i>

212
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:58,222
[Cara] <i>Okay, just another question on that front.</i>

213
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:01,861
<i> We've got a question from Robert McQueeny.</i>

214
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,713
<i>And he says, how can you protect yourself against bad debts,</i>

215
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,844
<i> bad debts insurance or percentage of the insured amount,</i>

216
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:10,086
<i> as our margins are quite small and to be clear less than 18%?</i>

217
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:13,656
[Andrew] <i>Yeah. Well, that's a good question.</i>

218
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:20,921
<i>So, we'd had some thoughts -- insurance before and it is expensive. </i>

219
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:27,689
<i>And that said, certainly one client paid for itself with a large debt</i>

220
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:32,569
<i> and- was unpaid and the client went into liquidation. </i>

221
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,649
<i>Otherwise, that you can protect yourself</i>

222
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:39,588
<i>against, against bad debts that we talk about is become --,</i>

223
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:45,074
<i>is having director's guarantees, making sure your contacts are right,</i>

224
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:54,165
<i>and meeting the --, and really, I guess, being clear on engaging --.</i>

225
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:58,443
<i>We'll probably talk and move on to</i>

226
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:00,823
<i>this section because this is where</i>

227
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:04,729
<i>we'll talk about how to prevent customers from becoming late payers.</i>

228
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:12,798
<i>And this is really also how you pay and protect yourself from your- from debts.</i>

229
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,882
<i>So, look I think debtor insurance is a place for it. </i>

230
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:17,801
<i>It's not necessarily for all business.</i>

231
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:25,716
<i> If you're looking at using a factoring facility or a -- debt of finance,</i>

232
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:29,775
<i>then I say you might require a -- some debtor insurance</i>

233
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:35,298
<i>but I think there's some simple things that you could -- from next- in the next --</i>

234
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:42,329
<i>to help to- help to protect you against, against bad debts. </i>

235
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:49,868
<i>So, in our tips for preventing customers becoming late payers</i>

236
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:54,161
<i> and even to follow on from Robert's question in becoming bad debts,</i>

237
00:17:54,161 --> 00:18:00,126
<i>really things are on agreeing on your trading terms, signing off on -- or later</i>

238
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:04,414
<i>agreeing on something that works upfront, and choosing your customers real carefully,</i>

239
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:10,785
<i>that's a, that's a great one probably --, asking for a deposit, invoicing regularly,</i>

240
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:15,381
<i>and now we see clients that complain a bit</i>

241
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:20,533
<i>and have been unable to collect the debtand -- months after that</i>

242
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:25,445
<i>and seems to live in it -- sending an invoice out,</i>

243
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:28,397
<i>now he goes out and say, "There's just -- it's not an --."</i>

244
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:36,898
<i>Credit checks and getting on issues early, and on the back of that --, and regular.</i>

245
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:43,525
<i>And so, what's your experience with them in signing off on engagements</i>

246
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,045
<i>and bringing in -- your clients up front.</i>

247
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:53,415
[Emily] <i>Yes. That would -- because initally, we're just going to the arrangement,</i>

248
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:56,357
<i>we have an engagement now but</i>

249
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:58,868
<i> now before we start any engagement we will --.</i>

250
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:02,853
<i>It's really important to get that -- signed off. </i>

251
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:08,947
<i>And we really ask the people to stand up front and -- when the work is complete</i>

252
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,923
<i> so that definitely has helped us manage our cashflow.</i>

253
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:16,288
<i>We invoice regularly so we invoice at the end of the month.</i>

254
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,220
<i>We usually invoice whenever, but now we've got some of the gain that</i>

255
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,778
<i> we do it religiously at the end of the month.</i>

256
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:25,344
<i>Everybody knows that on the first of the next month,</i>

257
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,214
<i>they're gonna get the invoice. </i>

258
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:28,723
<i>So, that's really helped us.</i>

259
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:34,479
<i>We have seven days payment terms and we get people to sign off on that --</i>

260
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:46,614
<i>and engagement later and agreement to -- so we're not going to be paying -- together.</i>

261
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:48,171
[Andrew]<i> So, all the deposit,</i>

262
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:51,415
<i> asking people 50% deposit. Any of the customer react to that?</i>

263
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:55,015
[Emily] <i>It's amazing most people saying it's not a problem.</i>

264
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:57,796
<i>There are some people who, who are trying to get around it</i>

265
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,816
<i> but they're not really the types of customers we want. </i>

266
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:07,358
<i>A lot of the times it will be what's involve in setting things up,</i>

267
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:11,529
<i>we have to go out and buy thing to do the job so we need the money up front --,</i>

268
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:19,749
<i>generally very happy to pay because -- I would have liked to receive money --.</i>

269
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:24,933
[Andrew] <i> Yeah, I heard.</i>

270
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:30,576
<i>So, choosing your customers carefully is difficult out there but --.</i>

271
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:34,162
<i>So, what experience have you had in --?</i>

272
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:38,037
<i>Have you always done that or did you learn the hard way?</i>

273
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,612
[Emily] <i> No, I definitely learned the hardway.</i>

274
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:42,332
<i>Initially you accept -- the business.</i>

275
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:47,526
<i>And then, now I can see -- is going on --</i>

276
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:54,564
<i>so it really is about picking your customers carefully and not --.</i>

277
00:20:54,564 --> 00:21:05,661
<i>Before we had a client that -- real late payer, we've -- any more which is just --.</i>

278
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:06,869
[Andrew] <i>Yeah.</i>

279
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,910
<i>It's, it's really --</i>

280
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,425
<i> it's sends off that competence in your own ability, in your own service to the product.</i>

281
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:14,409
[Emily] <i>Definitely.</i>

282
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:17,393
[Andrew] <i>And having the ability to say no to -- can be difficult.</i>

283
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:18,087
[Emily] <i> Yeah.</i>

284
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:20,366
[Andrew] <i> But, can prevent a lot of issues down the track.</i>

285
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,479
[Emily] <i>Yeah, well, it's hardly -- that.</i>

286
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:25,654
[Cara] <i>Okay, I've got another, another question for you.</i>

287
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:26,749
<i>It's coming from Sharon. </i>

288
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:31,086
<i>She's a sole trader and wants to know should she have an engagement letter put together</i>

289
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:36,759
<i>and is that something she can write herself or does it need to be a legal document?</i>

290
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,097
[Andrew] <i> That's a good question, Cara. </i>

291
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:47,342
<i>And the- I think the answer probably varies.</i>

292
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:52,118
<i>I think it probably depends on, you know, the type of work she's doing, the nature of it,</i>

293
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:54,277
<i> how much money is involved.</i>

294
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:58,051
<i>If they're, if they're big contracts and big engagements,</i>

295
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:01,869
<i>I would think then that's probably worth getting legal advice around it.</i>

296
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:04,653
<i>But, if it's small engagements,</i>

297
00:22:04,653 --> 00:22:07,854
<i>then perhaps it's something that she could even draw up</i>

298
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:10,589
<i>together with her customers and clients,</i>

299
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,778
<i>decide well, based on the terms of engagements</i>

300
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:17,274
<i>and this is what we're gonna the deliver and this is what we expect from you.</i>

301
00:22:17,274 --> 00:22:21,444
<i>And, Emily, have you done with your engagement letters?</i>

302
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:23,730
[Emily] <i>I actually used an engagement</i>

303
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,327
<i> letter that somebody has given me where my terms is provided</i>

304
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:30,738
<i>and I just change it exactly so that I could use it for myself.</i>

305
00:22:30,738 --> 00:22:33,075
<i>So, it's not a legal document --</i>

306
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:47,208
<i>it probably need to be a little bit more-- you get and it's complicated.</i>

307
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:53,069
<i>So, you try to find your own -- some other people</i>

308
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:55,680
<i>and making your own medium like the --.</i>

309
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,382
[Andrew] <i>Yeah. In small business, </i>

310
00:22:57,382 --> 00:22:59,152
<i>I think, that we've got to take a practical approach.</i>

311
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:03,365
<i>I would say, Cara and -- Sharon,</i>

312
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:06,714
<i>depending on the size of the- and nature of engagement.</i>

313
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:09,573
<i>If it's complicated and there's a lot of --</i>

314
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:13,249
<i>involved it's simply worth getting then some legal advice</i>

315
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:15,816
<i>but they're, they're smaller contracts,</i>

316
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:21,158
<i>I think, she could probably talk to them and maybe even draw things up</i>

317
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:23,566
<i> with her customers so know they did it together.</i>

318
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:27,171
<i>And so takes in, take in advice and see if she can find</i>

319
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:28,707
<i> engagement letter -- Sharon.</i>

320
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:34,918
[Emily] <i>And Sharon, Google is always great.</i>

321
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:38,652
<i>-- amazing what you can find online.</i>

322
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:45,885
<i>There's hundreds of free template, template, templates, about- sorry, that's not an option.</i>

323
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:47,861
[Cara] <i>Okay. </i>

324
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:52,734
<i>We've got another question, which is possible airing on the side of advice, as well. </i>

325
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:56,854
<i>But, this is from Amanda and she was in Child Care industry.</i>

326
00:23:56,854 --> 00:24:01,351
<i>And she said they've had a parent who signed legal contracts and agreements,</i>

327
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:04,811
<i>and now refuses to pay as he said English is not his first language</i>

328
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:07,468
<i>and he never understood what he was signing.</i>

329
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:08,882
[Emily] <i>Okay.</i>

330
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,269
[Andrew] <i>Yeah.</i>

331
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:16,193
<i>I think, I think there's certainly, this time they better get advice</i>

332
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:17,756
<i> and you have to get my advice.</i>

333
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,563
<i>And we can't give legal advice at you today. </i>

334
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:23,441
<i> Cara, I don't know. </i>

335
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:27,987
<i>You're not asking --, that's probably, that's probably the next step for Amanda,</i>

336
00:24:27,987 --> 00:24:33,396
<i>depending on, you know, the -- and --.</i>

337
00:24:33,396 --> 00:24:38,066
<i>Ultimately, she could do is refer it to a debt collection- a debt collector</i>

338
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,089
<i>or debt collection agency as well.</i>

339
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:44,089
<i>So...</i>

340
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,229
[Cara] <i> Okay, great.</i>

341
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:48,830
<i> And I'll let you keep moving before I ask some more questions.</i>

342
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,128
[Andrew] <i> No worries. </i>

343
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:57,352
<i>And so, if we move on in our top three tips program for preventing late payers,</i>

344
00:24:57,352 --> 00:25:04,443
<i>choosing your customers carefully and that takes confidence, doesn't it?</i>

345
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:10,725
<i>You've gotta have faith in your ability, you own collection service -- future business.</i>

346
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:12,472
[Emily] <i> Yeah. Definitely.</i>

347
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:12,819
[Andrew] <i>Agree with trading terms and your scope in writing. </i>

348
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:17,585
<i>Now, that's-</i>

349
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:23,603
<i>so many disputes can be avoided by having it in writing up front before you commence.</i>

350
00:25:23,603 --> 00:25:24,587
[Emily] <i> Yeah.</i>

351
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:26,648
<i>That's something that I definitely learned the hard way.</i>

352
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:31,921
<i>-- and generally, they are on your favor.</i>

353
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,707
[Andrew] <i>Yeah, right.</i>

354
00:25:33,707 --> 00:25:38,098
<i>So, agree in writing and finally,</i>

355
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:42,220
<i> follow your debt management process religiously.</i>

356
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,655
<i>If you're gonna have a crisis, that was not worth having a crisis</i>

357
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:47,310
<i> if you're not gonna fold.</i>

358
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,299
[Emily] <i>And, you know, -- that this is not fun </i>

359
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:55,485
<i>and it's not something that I love doing but I've learned that I have to do it</i>

360
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:59,442
<i>because I find that it's important and needs to do everyday.</i>

361
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:01,488
[Andrew] <i>Yeah. Having a crisis, not yet.</i>

362
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:03,280
<i>It helps that.</i>

363
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,273
<i>And so, looking at ways to do where we can find customers.</i>

364
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:11,334
<i>Again, there's a whole range of different things that we can do.</i>

365
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:16,446
<i>These are the things that we thought are the most critical when it comes to-</i>

366
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:20,261
<i>So, we haven't been out to educate them and -- them but,</i>

367
00:26:20,261 --> 00:26:23,118
<i>the customers in trying them</i>

368
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:24,845
<i> while using those tips and techniques that's --. </i>

369
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:28,671
<i>The reason why is that we do -- our customers.</i>

370
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,432
<i>You got to have a data system. </i>

371
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:33,639
<i>If you don't have a data system, you've got no real way of tracking them and --.</i>

372
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:36,565
<i>And maybe -- and why, --. </i>

373
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:42,692
<i>Then, your product and service, follow the system,</i>

374
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:47,079
<i>keep in close contact with your customers.</i>

375
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,383
<i>I mean, everyone has a right to be paid.</i>

376
00:26:49,383 --> 00:26:55,719
<i>I think, if you value your product or serviceand remember that there are people</i>

377
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:58,537
<i>who wanna buy it, and usually they're...</i>

378
00:26:58,537 --> 00:27:02,779
<i>If you do and that is if you're in the trade and dealing with other business,</i>

379
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:05,713
<i>in selling or in business of sales, they're looking to make money too.</i>

380
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:09,300
<i>So, everyone has a right to get paid.</i>

381
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:14,018
<i>And don't be afraid to ask the payment and it's all about that one and it's --.</i>

382
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:18,162
<i>Get advice, use debt collectors, and then train your staff,</i>

383
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:22,858
<i>and in your processes don't feel like -- and ask your customers to commit to --.</i>

384
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:32,828
<i>They might be using --, you -- and at that time.</i>

385
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:36,632
<i> So, what's your experience, Emily, in dealing with late payers?</i>

386
00:27:36,632 --> 00:27:42,300
[Emily] <i> My experience is that if you keep on top of it,</i>

387
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,741
<i>-- to pay -- you will be the first to be paid.</i>

388
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:53,182
<i>So, if you're not active, you will be pushed to the bottom of the que --. </i>

389
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:57,914
<i>So, it's about emailing, communicating, </i>

390
00:27:57,914 --> 00:28:03,734
<i>calling out with front call, and then if you get nervous making sure that you send</i>

391
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:10,151
<i> formal letter of demand and that -- certainly well.</i>

392
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,251
<i>But, you need to be on top of it.</i>

393
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,799
<i>You need to make sure that -- a lot.</i>

394
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:19,254
<i>If you're rude or --, they're not gonna respond very nicely to you.</i>

395
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:25,185
<i>So, it's just about making sure that you -- the relationship.</i>

396
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:28,286
<i>Well, because the payer person, when he --.</i>

397
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:34,383
[Andrew] <i>So, do you like --?</i>

398
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:37,471
[Emily] <i>Definitely not. It's not true.</i>

399
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:41,823
<i>In fact, -- I have to do it. </i>

400
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:45,438
<i>So, I'm very disciplined to that making sure that I -- </i>

401
00:28:45,438 --> 00:28:51,058
<i>And initially it was probably very scary,we have -- the money,</i>

402
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:58,570
<i>But now, -- confident asking for money.</i>

403
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,687
[Andrew] <i>Yeah.</i>

404
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:04,209
<i>You wanna make more businessjust it's one of those jobs that -- doing.</i>

405
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:08,710
<i>And, unfortunately, you can't be inbusiness with that, without collecting</i>

406
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,885
<i>-- bills.</i>

407
00:29:10,885 --> 00:29:11,736
[Emily] <i>That's right.</i>

408
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:14,411
[Cara] <i>So, I've got a question on that topic from Tammy.</i>

409
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:18,385
<i>She says their business involve trade.</i>

410
00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:20,429
<i>She's a trades person.</i>

411
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:23,265
<i>So, most transactions are under $200.</i>

412
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:27,846
<i>So, what would be a good way to informlot's of smaller customers of your</i>

413
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:30,732
<i>payment terms without putting them off your services.</i>

414
00:29:30,732 --> 00:29:40,535
[Andrew] <i>Yeah, so, I think, -- is quite a bit</i>

415
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:45,807
<i> -- you need a venue for your product and services</i>

416
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:52,460
<i>And since, it's Tammy, we need tojust go ahead and open it --</i>

417
00:29:52,460 --> 00:30:00,213
<i>If you're worried that some people mightleave or stop using your business,</i>
