00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:03,813
I had an A&R man once.

153
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:09,662
His big suggestion to me	was thatI cover Elvis Presley's <i>In The Ghetto.</i>

154
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,496
I was livid, and as I startedto try to respond to that,

155
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:22,064
that simple kind of emotional,vulnerable kind of thing,

156
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:25,878
kind of got splattered around.

- <i>The challenge, though, is still,once you get in that mainstream</i>

175
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,177
to not become mainstream. That is to say,to remain your authentic self,

176
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:54,128
to still make the communitythat produced you, proud of you.

177
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:59,421
To not, in the cultural vernacular,to become a sell-out.

00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:02,542
- <i>Sell-out</i>? I'm not crazy aboutthat word...

179
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:07,205
because...we're all entrepreneurs.

180
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:10,536
To me...

181
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:15,886
I don't care whether you owna furniture store or whatever,

182
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:19,543
the best sign you can put up is,

183
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:22,023
"Sold out".- <i>Sold out.</i>

184

- Can we make that subservient?[speech overlap]

187
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,595
- It is a profound point.

188
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:40,140
One, is a Shakespearian point.

189
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,157
To thine own self be true.- [Bill] Uh-huh

190
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:45,564
- If night follows the day,thou can be false to no one.

191
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:48,989
You have been true to yourself.

192
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:51,890
You don't sound like Paul Simonon the guitar.

193
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,871
You're Bill Withersbecause you come out of your roots.

194
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:58,668
When you sing <i>Grandma's Hands,</i>you start talking about Matty,

195
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:02,297
and talking about grandmataking care of local, unwed mothers

196
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:07,218
in Virginia, West Virginia, that's real.That's being yourself.

197
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:11,568
At the same time, in being yourself,you're able to cross over

198
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:18,005
into a white mainstream, and they hadto accept you on your own terms.

199
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:28,980
- <i>You see, looking at this thing is... - You gotta be careful.</i>

Well, I guess this was brothersand sisters I had that never lived.

203
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,619
I was the last of 13 kidsthat my mother had.

204
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:52,148
I guess I wasn't born yet,so I'm not in here anywhere.

205
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:57,010
Grackus Monroe Gallowaywas my mother's father.

206
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:59,074
He was born a slave.

207
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:02,584
He was probably nine years oldwhen they freed the slaves.

208
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:07,134
He worked in the coal mines but he wouldnever work for the coal company.

209
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:09,979
He hauled coal--here's Grandma.

210
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:15,795
Now, I took this picture when I was a kid,

211
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:19,765
so you can see what year it was by the car.

212
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:28,782
Most of us at some point in our liveshave somebody that means more to us

213
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:32,339
than anyone else that has ever meantbefore or will ever mean again.

214
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,471
Sometimes it's a long-legged lady,if you're a man,

215
00:15:35,471 --> 00:15:40,214
or some tall, very smoothed man,if you're a woman.

216
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:45,271
But in my case, I learned how to reallylove somebody from just a nice old lady.

217
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:50,584
My favorite thing that I've written has to beabout this favorite old lady of mine.

803
00:55:55,772 --> 00:56:01,639
I was a stutterer until I was 28.I used to avoid the phone and, you know,

just anywhere where you had to talk.

805
00:56:05,456 --> 00:56:10,417
And people would get up in your faceand say, "Spit it out, spit it out!"

- <i>[Raul] Yeah. </i>

what do you do after youfind out you're here?

813
00:56:31,202 --> 00:56:35,905
So then, you know, there was a phrasethat I kept batting around,

"In my mind's eye, I can seethe world from here."

00:56:47,521 --> 00:56:49,506
so you don't forget it.- [Raul] I'm writing it down.

00:56:50,653 --> 00:56:54,513
