- You're just simply carrying the virus,
is that correct?

450
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:13,991
- I have a few very minor symptoms
and my immune system is virtually shot.

Dextran Sulfate legally, I'm taking it

about Dextran Sulfate, 
and neither do you--

456
00:30:26,248 --> 00:30:28,585

it's an over-the-counter drug in Japan

457
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:29,589
and has been for 20 years, 
over-the-counter.

458
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:31,700
- <i>[Pat] Over-the-counter in Japan? </i>
- Yes.

459
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,551
- [Tom] But if the FDA says--
- <i>[Pat] Mr. Staley--</i>

460
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:35,957
- I'm only asking 
that they be released after--

461
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:40,378
after there's a minimal amount 
of efficacy, not a 100% test.

462
00:30:40,378 --> 00:30:44,215

the pink triangle on your shirt,

463
00:30:44,507 --> 00:30:46,457
I gather that means you're a homosexual.

464
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:47,207
- Yes.

465
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,036
- <i>Looking in the camera,</i>
what would you tell some kids,

466
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:51,283
say, you had a younger brother,
twenty-one years old,

467
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:54,392
who also might have homosexual tendencies,

468
00:30:54,392 --> 00:30:56,971
what would you tell him if you want him
to live a long life?

469
00:30:56,971 --> 00:31:00,283
- Use a condom, and also to use
a lubricant, by the way,

470
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:02,192
that has the medicine--

471
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:04,490
- [Pat] And actually 
this is <i>Russian roulette.</i>

472
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,019
- It is not Russian roulette.
It is Russian roulette to not give people

473
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:12,255
this information when human nature
dictates that they're gonna go out there

474
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:14,260
and they're gonna have sex anywhere. 
- You mean celibacy is impossible?

475
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,450
- It's not just gonna work.
People aren’t gonna do it

476
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,424
and lots of people are gonna die.

477
00:31:18,424 --> 00:31:22,814
Now, would you rather have a lot of people
cheating under the celibacy

478
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:26,004
with thousands of people dying
or would you rather save those lives?

479
00:31:26,004 --> 00:31:27,825
and let them have sex.

480
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:29,676

were all that great.

603
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:23,019

- [Emilio] At Merck, HIV was an important
scientific target.

607
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:43,834
HIV of course is a virus.

608
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:47,607
In order for the virus to infect
an uninfected cell,

609
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,912
it needs to construct itself
in a particular way.

610
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:57,476
<i>First, the viral RNA needs</i>
to transform itself into a DNA copy,

611
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:59,917
<i>in order to knit itself into</i>

612
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:02,914
<i>the nuclear DNA </i>
of the newly infected cell.

613
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:06,782
<i>This occurs via process called,</i>
reversed transcription.

614
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:12,672
<i>AZT and DDI were both</i>
originally developed to try to inhibit

615
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:15,894
<i>that process of establishing infection.</i>

616
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:19,447
<i>A number of other researchers</i>
began to focus on another portion

617
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:23,378
<i>of the viral life cycle,</i>
after the cell is already infected.

618
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:29,074
One of the steps that it takes is that
it makes a viral protein.

619
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:33,750
It has to snip that viral protein
in very specific places.

620
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:39,478
<i>The resulting pieces self-assemble</i>
to make the viral particle.

621
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:43,336
<i>And what does the snipping</i>
and what in fact controls the snipping,

622
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:46,399
<i>is a viral protein called,</i>
the protease.

623
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,937
<i>If you genetically modified </i>
the viral protease,

624
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:50,635
<i>so that it can no longer snip--</i>

625
00:40:50,635 --> 00:40:54,307
<i>The virus no longer has the ability</i>
to make those component pieces

626
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:56,237
<i>that it need to make in order</i>
to self-assemble

627
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:59,143
<i>and make an infectious viral particle.</i>

628
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,740
- [Joseph] We solved the structure
of HIV protease

629
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,455
in 1989, and published it pretty quickly.

630
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:10,963
I think we saw the structure and within
a few weeks, it was in the literature.

631
00:41:10,963 --> 00:41:12,800
- And then the question became,
"Alright, can we prove it?

632
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,456
Can we prove it 
that that is in fact the case?

633
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:18,515
And most importantly, can we prove that

634
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:22,218
if you inhibit that protease,
if you knock out its activity,

635
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:26,702
that the virus can no longer replicate,
and therefore make new progeny

636
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:29,071
viral particles that would
then go on and establish

637

00:47:55,767 --> 00:48:01,671
<i>but it's my understanding that </i>
thousands of people died from pneumonia

742
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:04,473
<i>because there was no priority </i>
within the government,

743
00:48:04,473 --> 00:48:07,248
<i>or within the medical system as a whole,</i>

744
00:48:07,248 --> 00:48:11,560
<i>to push the known preventive treatments</i>
for a long time.

745
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,578
<i>Now, those thousands of people are dead.</i>

746
00:48:14,578 --> 00:48:16,052
<i>It would seem to me that someone</i>

747
00:48:16,052 --> 00:48:21,233
who was within the government, 
while that took place as you work,

748
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:24,324
must have wrung your conscience 
of these deaths.

749
00:48:24,324 --> 00:48:26,602
- That is a tough one.

750
00:48:26,602 --> 00:48:28,256
- No, it really is.

751
00:48:28,256 --> 00:48:32,041
It's inexcusable that 
an academic priority should ever,

752
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:35,238
ever come before the health of the people
that you're working with.

753
00:48:35,238 --> 00:48:39,036
<i>There's no questions about that,</i>
but the reality of the situation is,

754
00:48:39,036 --> 00:48:46,639
there was a great reluctance
among the community of everything

755
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,562
from the scientists to the congress
saying that

756
00:48:50,562 --> 00:48:56,041
what we should be doing
is not telling investigators what to do

757
00:48:56,041 --> 00:49:00,292
but we should allow them to do
what they feel is the most important.

758
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:01,440
Now, that sounds awful

759
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,850
when you're putting into the context
of what we're talking about here.

760
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:08,289
But the whole world isn't in this room.

research priorities are defined.

773
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:52,383

But the NIH is only testing old the drugs.

774
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,747
Drugs that we already have.

- Hi! I'm Jimmy Johnson,

777
00:49:58,384 --> 00:50:02,766
And right now, I'm observing and

Why do you support this action?

stupidity, incompetence, and greed.

790
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:33,414
Those are the three major driving force 
behind what's going on here,

791
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:35,130
and why there are no treatments

[THUMP!]

807
00:51:49,499 --> 00:51:53,757
- If anything the mood after the NIH
was even bleaker than the mood before.

808
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:55,211
Because we had no indication

809
00:51:55,211 --> 00:51:58,708
that they were gonna change 
or respond to our demands.

810
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:02,265
And we had in fact had a meeting with them
in Bethesda, after the NIH action.

811
00:52:02,265 --> 00:52:05,222
That indicated that there was
total resistance to putting people

812
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,364
from the community 
on the research committees,

813
00:52:07,364 --> 00:52:09,411
to let in the ACT UP observers 
attend the meetings,

814
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:12,135
and to open up the meetings 
so that they weren't secret anymore.

815
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:14,380
So why should Science
be shrowded in secrecy?

816
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,288
It's supposed to be based on
a free exchange of ideas.

817
00:52:17,288 --> 00:52:21,644
And so, it was very important
to stage in San Francisco,

818
00:52:21,644 --> 00:52:25,092
before again the global community of
scientist and people working on AIDS,

819
00:52:25,092 --> 00:52:29,659
why we had been at the NIH.
Why the U.S. systems wasn’t working out.

820
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:31,670
And to reach the people directly

821
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:35,066
that we had reached symbolically 
through the NIH action.

822

- <i>[newsman] About a hundred protesters</i>

at the international AIDS conference
that began today in San Francisco.

824
00:52:55,585 --> 00:52:58,607
Hundreds more are angrily
protesting a government policy

825
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:03,082

and ostracizes victims."

all of you and the activists,

<i>I will need a great deal of help</i>
from all of you.

833

Can we all, before it's too late,
begin to understand each other.

00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:41,443
Will we realize that we share
similar motivations.

835
00:53:42,072 --> 00:53:45,647
During the upcoming days, 
ACT UP New York will be handing out

836
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:50,196
our AIDS treatment agenda,
which includes a list of 99 drugs

837
00:53:50,196 --> 00:53:53,531

However, from your side,
we are being constantly told to butt out.

840
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:08,688
On my side, the level of anger
and frustration is reaching such a point

841
00:54:08,688 --> 00:54:14,472
that attitudes claiming that all of you 
are uncaring and in it for greed

While at times we may offend you,

<i>the more people who were dying.</i>

1038
01:07:20,942 --> 01:07:23,416
<i>Once a week we met,</i>

1039
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:27,369
<i>and at that meeting, a lot of people came </i>
who were just terrified

1040
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:30,463
<i>they weren’t gonna be alive</i>
even the next week.

1041
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,047
<i>What can we do?</i>
How can we get there?

1042
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:35,658
- <i>[Jim] I think ACT UPs anger turned in</i>

1043
01:07:35,658 --> 01:07:39,617
<i>after having been directed out so long. </i>

1044
01:07:39,617 --> 01:07:43,977
- <i>In it's first few years,</i>
Treatment and Data pretty much

1045
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:48,488
<i>got everything it wanted</i>
from the floor of ACT UP.

1046
01:07:48,488 --> 01:07:54,018
<i>But as Treatment and Data was becoming</i>
more and more technical,

1047
01:07:54,018 --> 01:07:58,037
<i>there were a lot of people in the</i>
general membership of ACT UP

1048
01:07:58,037 --> 01:08:03,872
They saw that as an elite and that
maybe it would be better if

1049
01:08:04,852 --> 01:08:07,540
that elite was pulled in a bit.

1050
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:13,936
- There was a fear I think that we were
getting too close to the people in power.

1051
01:08:13,936 --> 01:08:17,315
That we would compromise 
our own principles

1052
01:08:17,315 --> 01:08:19,514
and the people who were more interested

1053
01:08:19,514 --> 01:08:23,132
in the social issues became
uncomfortable with that.

1054
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:28,429
- I remember this very decisive moment 
where there was a proposal for moratorium

1055
01:08:28,429 --> 01:08:32,920
on meeting with drug companies 
for six months.

1056
01:08:33,482 --> 01:08:36,889
And there was a huge and impassioned
debate over and someone said,

1057
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:40,288
a woman, who is not HIV-positive said,

1058
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:42,901
"Well, it's not like 
it's the rest of your life."

1059
01:08:42,901 --> 01:08:47,573
And for a lot of people in the room,
it was the rest of their lives.

1060
01:08:47,573 --> 01:08:50,360
[crowd chanting]

1061
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:54,031
- <i>There were inevitable splits </i>
in priorities.

1062
01:08:54,031 --> 01:08:55,944
- You know it quite well.
- <i>[male voice] I know. </i>

1063
01:08:55,944 --> 01:08:59,672
- And it was completely left out of the
NIH research agenda.

1064
01:08:59,672 --> 01:09:02,304
- <i>[male voice] I agree. </i>

1065
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:07,118
- <i>I remember a lot of dirty tricks</i>
that happened and a lot of fear

1066
01:09:07,118 --> 01:09:11,898
<i>within the organization that various</i>
factions had done this to each other.

1067
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:16,701
- Mark Harrington. Mark Harrington.
There's a video camera in here now.

1068
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:18,743
Would you like to take an oath

1069
01:09:18,743 --> 01:09:21,200
that you will not write nasty 
anonymous letters to people?

1070
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,887
- I've been getting some
hate letters too, but those are unsigned.

1071
01:09:24,887 --> 01:09:26,308
I don't ever-- I don't ever--

1072
01:09:26,308 --> 01:09:28,707
- <i>So you keep on writing </i>
nasty letters to people?

1073
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:34,309
- There were a lot of charges in the midst
of that of sabotage and threats.

1074
01:09:34,309 --> 01:09:37,708
- [David Barr] Our last speaker 
is Larry Kramer.

1075
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:41,135
- <i>[male voice] Why don’t you answer</i>
the charges?

1076
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,429

the chance to speak, alright?

1077
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,852

1080
01:09:50,337 --> 01:09:53,881
- <i>[Bill] You can't just lick his ass </i>
before he talks!

1081
01:09:53,881 --> 01:09:57,061
- <i>[male voice] Shut the fuck up </i>
and let him answer.

1082
01:09:57,061 --> 01:09:59,243
- Look! There are a lot of people 
in the audience,

1083
01:09:59,243 --> 01:10:00,897
who wanna ask and talk about treatment.

1084
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:04,661
And I think it's important that
you allow that to happen.

1085
01:10:04,661 --> 01:10:06,078
-<i>[Bill] Oh, are you gonna take away </i>
free speech now?

1086

I don't-- [male shouting]

1088

- <i>[male voice] You're making </i>
the same point George Bush --

1089
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:19,684
- PLAGUE! We are in the middle of a
fucking plague!

1090
01:10:19,684 --> 01:10:22,394
and you behave like this!

PLAGUE!

1092
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,935
Forty million infected people
is a fucking plague!

1093
01:10:41,895 --> 01:10:47,090
We are in the worst shape
we have ever, ever, ever been in!

1094
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:52,872
All those pills we're shoveling down
our throats! Forget it!

1095
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:56,918
ACT UP has been taken over 
by a lunatic fringe

1096
01:10:56,918 --> 01:10:59,569
that can't get together!
Nobody agrees with anything!

1097
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:03,644
All we can do is field a couple of hundred
people at a demonstration!

1098
01:11:03,644 --> 01:11:08,091
That's not gonna make anybody
pay attention!

1099
01:11:08,091 --> 01:11:10,914
Not until we get millions out there!

1100
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:15,552
We can't do that!
All we do is pick at each other,

1101
01:11:15,552 --> 01:11:20,133
and yell at each other!
And I say to you, in year 10,

1102
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:27,639
the same thing I said to you in 1981
when there were 41 cases.

1103
01:11:29,004 --> 01:11:36,976
Until we get our acts together,
all of us--we are as good as dead.

1104
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:43,367
- <i>In the end,</i>
the Treatment and Data guys,

1105
01:11:43,367 --> 01:11:46,859
<i>Peter, Garance, Mark</i>
and some others split off

1106

<i>and formed their own</i>
separate organization.

1107
01:11:50,824 --> 01:11:53,721
- <i>TAG was one of the little</i>
mercury balls that flew off

1108
01:11:53,721 --> 01:12:00,263
the main body of ACT UP, a more
think tank-typed project came about.

1109
01:12:01,098 --> 01:12:05,325
- <i>Mr. Harrington, a TAG member,</i>
educated at the Harvard College.

1110
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:09,317
<i>And he has worked for a long time</i>
on experimental treatments

1111
01:12:09,317 --> 01:12:12,310
<i>for the disease</i>
and also the basic science

1112
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:16,531
and Mr. Gonsalvez was born
in Long Island

1113
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:20,287
and attended Tufts University,
also a TAG member.

1114
01:12:20,864 --> 01:12:26,209
I guess I can do nothing better than to
turn this conference over to my speakers.

1115
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:31,384
- <i>I noticed that you're both sitting</i>
up there in suits and ties.

1116
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:36,512
<i>Do you feel that your approach</i>
is better than circling

1117
01:12:36,512 --> 01:12:40,040
<i>NIH buildings and so forth?</i>

1118
01:12:40,428 --> 01:12:46,302
- I think that we like to keep our options
open, but it's silly to risk arrest

1119
01:12:46,302 --> 01:12:50,058
and the hassles that are tended upon
and if you can get serious attention

1120
01:12:50,058 --> 01:12:52,949
and negotiations going
with other measures.

1121
01:12:53,927 --> 01:12:57,776
- We've just released a report,
a critique of all the NIH's AIDS programs.

1122
01:12:57,776 --> 01:13:01,533
- The research is spread out over
12 agencies. There's no coordination.

1123
01:13:01,533 --> 01:13:04,864
There's a lot of duplications.
There's no leadership.

1124
01:13:04,864 --> 01:13:07,451
- The budget is shrinking and shrinking
as cases mount

1125
01:13:07,451 --> 01:13:10,424
and the President needs to be blamed
as well as the Congress.

1126
01:13:10,424 --> 01:13:13,957
Who cut the entire NIH budget
by 150 million two weeks ago.

1127
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:17,490
- Our recommendations, I think,
are gonna require some legislation

1128
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:21,202
and so we have to go 
to our friends on the hill

1129
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:24,975
and see what wonders 
they could work for us.

1131
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:38,668
- We had this one particular compound that
looked like it may have had the potency

1132
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:41,746
and the physical properties 
that we wanted,

1133
01:13:41,746 --> 01:13:43,744
and it could be a possible drug.

1134
01:13:43,744 --> 01:13:46,206
- He said, "You know, let's put this in
HIV-infected individuals

1135
01:13:46,206 --> 01:13:48,361
and let's see what happens".

1136
01:13:48,361 --> 01:13:51,900
<i>So we went into a HIV-infected individuals</i>
with this drug called Crixivan.

1137
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,500
<i>And you could see </i>
a very substantial drug.

1138
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,060
<i>Just with one protease inhibitor,</i>

1139
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,058
<i>you could see very substantial </i>
drop in virus load.

1140
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:01,055
So that was the first week. 
The second week was very disappointing.

1141
01:14:01,055 --> 01:14:03,897
Because what we saw
in the second week was in fact,

1142
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,851
virus load coming right back up again.

1143
01:14:06,851 --> 01:14:08,150
One exception...

1144
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:14,450
- There was one patient that--
patient #143, I believe, was his number,

1145
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:17,630
that the virus went down
and stayed down.

1146
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:19,807
- That told us that it was possible.

1147
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:22,313
If it can happen in one, 
then by definition,

1148
01:14:22,313 --> 01:14:26,490
it can happen in everyone. You just need 
to figure out how to do it.

1149
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:28,161
That puts you 
in a completely different place,

1150
01:14:28,161 --> 01:14:30,549
and in a completely different 
state of mind.

1151
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:31,855
So then the question became,

1152
01:14:31,855 --> 01:14:35,513
"Okay, now what do we need to do
in order to make it possible?"

01:31:14,593 --> 01:31:18,055
Dr. Kessler, how excited should we get
about this new family of drugs,

1326
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:19,922
these protease inhibitors?

1327
01:31:19,922 --> 01:31:24,007
- I don't wanna over-promise,
but these are the most potent drugs

1328
01:31:24,007 --> 01:31:26,794
we've seen against the virus.

1329
01:31:26,794 --> 01:31:30,681
- I know that you are pushing
for faster FDA approval of these drugs,

1330
01:31:30,681 --> 01:31:33,810
I know that the application has just gone
for the first of these drugs to the FDA,

1331
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:35,093
it's still gonna take six months.

1332
01:31:35,093 --> 01:31:39,284
- We will turn around that application
as quick as ever.

1333
01:31:39,284 --> 01:31:42,217
We are proving drugs
in a matter of months these days.

1334
01:31:42,217 --> 01:31:44,219
- But you were telling me, 
that's six months, right?

1335
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:45,617
That's as quick as possible.

1336
01:31:45,617 --> 01:31:47,759
- We may be able to do it
even a little quicker.

1337
01:31:47,759 --> 01:31:51,142
- <i>[newsman] A split has developed between </i>
those who want rapid approval

1338
01:31:51,142 --> 01:31:55,868
<i>based on early indicators of success,</i>
and the Treatment Action Group, or TAG.

1339
01:31:55,868 --> 01:32:00,342
<i>TAG has asked the FDA to reconsider</i>
the accelerated approval process.

1340
01:32:00,495 --> 01:32:01,814
- <i>[Peter] We we told the FDA,</i>

1341
01:32:01,814 --> 01:32:05,923
<i>"No, the company has asked you</i>
to approve that drug too soon.

1342
01:32:05,923 --> 01:32:08,297
<i>They need a little bit more data first.</i>

1343
01:32:08,512 --> 01:32:12,472
- <i>[newsman] TAG is asking the FDA </i>
to take a closer look at Saquinavir,

1344
01:32:12,472 --> 01:32:15,673
<i>the first protease inhibitor</i>
to seek approval.

1345
01:32:15,673 --> 01:32:19,630
- <i>We need to make sure we don't repeat</i>
the mistake we made with AZT and DDI.

1346
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:22,901
<i>This is a new class of drugs.</i>
We need to know if it works.

1347
01:32:24,176 --> 01:32:29,700
- <i>The battle over early approval</i>
of Saquinavir was a really pivotal moment

1348
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:35,403
<i>for treatment activism and we took</i>
such shit for it from within.

1349
01:32:35,403 --> 01:32:38,223
- There are a lot of people who do agree
that there are problems,

1350
01:32:38,223 --> 01:32:41,897
series of problems the way drug testing
and drug trials are run.

1351
01:32:41,897 --> 01:32:44,875
But there are many of us who feel that
halting--

1352
01:32:45,828 --> 01:32:50,009
accelerated approval is not necessarily
the answer.

1353
01:32:50,009 --> 01:32:52,776
- <i>[Bill] Tenet made their proposal</i>
for this large simple trial

1354
01:32:52,776 --> 01:32:57,835
of 18,000 people that they wanna put
in a placebo-controlled trial,

1355
01:32:57,835 --> 01:33:00,295
where one-third will get placebo.

1356
01:33:00,295 --> 01:33:03,707
They pushed this idea on the FDA
at a secret meeting,

1357
01:33:03,707 --> 01:33:05,861
which was not announced to the community.

1358
01:33:05,861 --> 01:33:08,879
<i>This is something we have fought</i>
hard and long for.

1359
01:33:08,879 --> 01:33:12,631
We've been arrested to get
accelerated approval through.

1360
01:33:12,631 --> 01:33:14,652
- It's the behavior that
I have a problem with.

1361
01:33:14,652 --> 01:33:17,509
It's the work they're doing
that I have a problem with,

1362
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:19,586
and this is what I am gonna fight.

1363
01:33:19,586 --> 01:33:22,084
I'm not interested 
in mud wrestling with the boys.

1364
01:33:22,084 --> 01:33:24,209
I am absolutely enraged 
that there are people

1365
01:33:24,209 --> 01:33:27,206
who have appointed themselves
a elitist representatives,

1366
01:33:27,206 --> 01:33:31,004
and represent themselves 
as a single voice of this epidemic.

1367
01:33:31,004 --> 01:33:33,603
I am gonna fight them.
My patients are gonna fight them.

1368
01:33:33,603 --> 01:33:36,612
And you God damn will go fight them!

1369
01:33:42,568 --> 01:33:44,984
- Currently, there's this big discussion
on accelerated approval

1370
01:33:44,984 --> 01:33:47,754
and last week on the floor.____

1371
01:33:47,754 --> 01:33:51,220
So we just wanted to give you
sort of the TAG perspective

1372
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,135
and give you a sense of our proposal
around pre-AIDS drug development

1373
01:33:54,135 --> 01:33:57,706
so we can start from a baseline 
common understanding and knowledge.

1374
01:33:57,706 --> 01:34:00,895
this proposal is not about taking
expanded access away,

1375
01:34:00,895 --> 01:34:04,143
taking accelerated approval away.
This is about adding something.

1376
01:34:04,143 --> 01:34:05,860
This is about figuring out 
how do we get

1377
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:08,357
information about how to actually 
use these drugs.

1378
01:34:08,357 --> 01:34:11,744
We need more people when you have
a less powerful drug.

1379
01:34:11,744 --> 01:34:15,422
If we give them the penicillin
we could do it to 20 people.

1380
01:34:15,422 --> 01:34:18,357
So we put together a large
simple trial that tried to synthesize

1381
01:34:18,357 --> 01:34:21,028
expanded access in large simple trial.

1382
01:34:21,028 --> 01:34:25,786
And what we did is we presented it 
to Merck. We presented it to the FDA.

1383
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:28,634
We wanted to start a community discussion.

1384
01:34:28,634 --> 01:34:33,077
- I just wanted to thank Greg and Derek
for coming to tell us about this.

1385
01:34:33,077 --> 01:34:34,636
[applause]

1386
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:38,534
- because we hadn’t heard anything
until we read about it in Barrons.

1387
01:34:38,534 --> 01:34:41,076
- If you wanted to hear the proposal
you could have heard it 40 times.

1388
01:34:41,076 --> 01:34:42,696
<i>It's been talked about all over. </i>

1389

- <i>Dr. Conley wants to speak. </i>

1390
01:34:44,663 --> 01:34:47,256
- TAG is talking about getting
accurate information.

1391
01:34:47,256 --> 01:34:49,996
ACT UP is talking 
about making drug available.

1392
01:34:49,996 --> 01:34:51,487
There should be a way to mesh those two.

1393
01:34:51,487 --> 01:34:54,516
It's really not one or the other.
These two groups are really

1394
01:34:54,516 --> 01:34:56,414
talking pass one another.

1395
01:34:56,414 --> 01:34:59,437
Try not to scream, try not to go for
each other's throats.

1396
01:34:59,437 --> 01:35:03,239
But just talk, because the difference is
really can be breached.

- They elevated themselves by their own
self education about these things.

And then it became very, very clear that
you weren’t gonna mess with these people

<i>where you have the patient in mind</i>
and you weren’t cut in corners.

was combination therapy.

not the way to go.

with Crixivan plus AZT plus 3TC.

1426
01:37:57,733 --> 01:38:00,114
- The activist proposed a study design,
the industry used it,

1427
01:38:00,114 --> 01:38:02,983
it got the drug approved in six months.

1428
01:38:02,983 --> 01:38:07,251

and I stood up there

it was like, 
"We did it! We did something."

- It was too much to take it 
at that point.

1438
01:38:33,808 --> 01:38:35,763
It wasn’t until we started 
putting the drugs

1439
01:38:35,763 --> 01:38:40,431
in our bodies. And we all went home 
and started--

1440
01:38:41,031 --> 01:38:44,197
went straight on that regimen
that had been on that slide,

1441

including Crixivan 
and two nucleoside analogues.

triple-drug combination.

01:39:00,911 --> 01:39:05,296
<i>and if you need your clinical trial,</i>
you could just go to these hospitals

1446
01:39:05,296 --> 01:39:09,444
<i>that were not filling up the way</i>
they were filling up with people with HIV.

melting back into their skin.

1450

that was a phenomenal feeling.

- It worked.
You know, we did something remarkable.

1455
01:39:31,037 --> 01:39:37,204
- So that breakthrough that we thought
was gonna happen in '88 or'89

1456
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:40,822
if we just work fast enough.
You know, it did happen...

1457
01:39:44,892 --> 01:39:50,261
but not until '96 and so...
you know, a lot of people died,

And there's probably

01:40:13,498 --> 01:40:16,495
a lot of complicated reasons why

1463
01:40:16,495 --> 01:40:21,602
but I still find it very difficult
to plan for the future and/or accept

1464
01:40:21,602 --> 01:40:27,834
that I will have long life, 
which is unfortunate

1465
01:40:27,834 --> 01:40:30,831
because I've had a long life

1466
01:40:30,831 --> 01:40:34,293
and I've been living with AIDS 
for 20 years.

1467
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:38,439
But it's hard for me to relax into life.

1468
01:40:40,392 --> 01:40:45,869
- I know lots of us went through really
difficult times after--

01:40:48,203 --> 01:40:51,726
trying to figure out what do I do now?
