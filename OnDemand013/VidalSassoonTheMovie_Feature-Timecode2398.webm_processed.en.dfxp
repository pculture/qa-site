      <p begin="00:27:51.536" end="00:27:54.549">On Thursday, at two o'clock,</p>
      <p begin="00:27:55.732" end="00:27:57.479">I turned up at The Old Vic.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:57.479" end="00:28:00.999">She said, "Up on the stage"</p>
      <p begin="00:28:00.999" end="00:28:04.020">"You see something there<br/>that you can read on the podium?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:04.429" end="00:28:06.780">I said, "Yes."</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06.780" end="00:28:09.018">She said, "Enunciate."</p>
      <p begin="00:28:09.018" end="00:28:11.056">Just the one word.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:11.056" end="00:28:14.093">And there was something for me to read.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:14.093" end="00:28:15.427">So, I enunciated.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.427" end="00:28:22.225">And she said, "My God! It's bloody awful!<br/>But I think I can do something with you."</p>
      <p begin="00:28:22.225" end="00:28:26.743">So, for three years, when I was in town,<br/>wasn't out doing shows,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:26.743" end="00:28:31.152">I was going to Iris Warren.<br/>She was working on the vowels.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:31.152" end="00:28:33.753">And it does work, it does help.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:33.753" end="00:28:37.351">It wasn't just the production of voice.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:37.351" end="00:28:39.653">It was when to keep it low.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:39.653" end="00:28:44.346">When to bring the audience in<br/>and when to modulate your audio.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44.346" end="00:28:45.937">It was totally fascinating.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:45.937" end="00:28:51.035">*It gave me the sense anyway<br/>that I could speak to a crowd of people</p>
      <p begin="00:28:51.035" end="00:28:53.475">and bring them in to what I was saying,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53.475" end="00:28:55.103">and have them understand.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:55.103" end="00:28:58.120">And it proved incredibly valuable.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.120" end="00:29:03.546">Had I gone to college,<br/>I would have definitely been an Architect.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:03.546" end="00:29:06.205">That would have been my dream,<br/>to be an Architect.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:06.205" end="00:29:08.830">Nineteen fifty-four,<br/>we worked in a very small salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.830" end="00:29:13.895">I was 26 then, and after two years,<br/>became far too small.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:13.895" end="00:29:16.589">It was a work-up<br/>on the third floor virtually.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.589" end="00:29:24.567">Then we moved to a much larger salon<br/>in Bond Street posh end as they say.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24.567" end="00:29:29.058">First, we did a white salon<br/>with a black boutique.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.058" end="00:29:33.179">And then later, we turned the whole salon<br/>into brown,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33.179" end="00:29:35.177">with just steel bars in the front.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:35.177" end="00:29:37.307">It looked like a hairdressing salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:37.307" end="00:29:39.603">It looked like a modern art gallery.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.603" end="00:29:42.648">&#9834; [music] &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.648" end="00:29:46.302">As we were changing everything,<br/>there's change of salons as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:46.302" end="00:29:48.371">So we changed the look of the salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.371" end="00:29:53.104">- There was his fabulous photographs on<br/>the wall as a collection of photographs.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:53.104" end="00:29:56.357">The tables were very modern.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:56.357" end="00:29:57.366">Everything was modern.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:57.366" end="00:29:58.352">It was open.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.352" end="00:30:00.845">You could see from the street<br/>into the salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.845" end="00:30:03.740">Now in those days, that was very unusual.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:03.740" end="00:30:05.684">That people would actually be seen<br/>getting their hair done</p>
      <p begin="00:30:05.684" end="00:30:07.524">was a revolution.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.524" end="00:30:12.579">- And people were walking around<br/>with a sort of a [snapping fingers] buzz.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:12.579" end="00:30:13.960">A click.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:13.960" end="00:30:17.775">And, it sort of created<br/>a soar of excitement.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:17.775" end="00:30:21.293">- And there was a mezzanine floor<br/>with all these women standing.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21.293" end="00:30:22.915">Hundreds of people in there.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:22.915" end="00:30:24.943">It was very difficult even to get<br/>to the receptionist</p>
      <p begin="00:30:24.943" end="00:30:27.464">because it was just<br/>so many people in the shop.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:27.464" end="00:30:29.252">- There was a hush in the salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:29.252" end="00:30:30.792">You hear the snapping of scissors.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:30.792" end="00:30:32.880">You hear -- not much chat going on.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:35.704">It wasn't like a heavy-gossipy place.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.704" end="00:30:37.805">It was like quite intense.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.805" end="00:30:41.488">-In this classy salon,<br/>boys fresh from Stretton in the suburbs,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41.488" end="00:30:44.693">give their long-suffering customers<br/>not what they want</p>
      <p begin="00:30:44.693" end="00:30:47.730">but what Vidal Sassoon<br/>believes they should have.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:49.881" end="00:30:52.961">- You're not gonna cut my hair forward,<br/>are you?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:52.961" end="00:30:58.633">- [Vidal] Well, Lynda, when you came in,<br/>I noticed that your hair was combed back.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:58.633" end="00:31:00.496">- Yes, I like it combed back,<br/>it's more flattering.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:00.496" end="00:31:02.255">I'd rather it went back from there.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:02.255" end="00:31:03.961">- Why do you want it combed back?<br/>Give me one good reason.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.961" end="00:31:05.884">- Well, it gives me height up there.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:05.884" end="00:31:07.025">- So, all your worrying<br/>about its height really.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07.025" end="00:31:07.794">- Yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07.794" end="00:31:10.895">- Not the fact that it goes<br/>back or forward but height.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:10.895" end="00:31:11.827">- It's what I've always had<br/>it going back there.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:11.827" end="00:31:13.841">- Ahh, we don't go what you've always had.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.841" end="00:31:15.997">Listen to me one moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.997" end="00:31:19.979">When you came in, because your hair<br/>was combed back and grows forward</p>
      <p begin="00:31:19.979" end="00:31:25.594">what you were getting here was a part,<br/>but it was an unintentional part.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:25.594" end="00:31:31.598">My feeling is that if your hair<br/>is shaped the way it grows.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31.598" end="00:31:35.853">Listen, [chuckling]<br/>if it's shaped the way it grows</p>
      <p begin="00:31:35.853" end="00:31:38.850">and you have your height put into it</p>
      <p begin="00:31:38.850" end="00:31:42.540">right across the hair,<br/>you are gonna get a much more defined</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42.540" end="00:31:43.739">and better shape.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:43.739" end="00:31:46.000">You'll get all the height you need<br/>and the shape of the head</p>
      <p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:47.764">will actually look better.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.764" end="00:31:48.862">Try this way.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:48.862" end="00:31:49.851">- Alright.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:49.851" end="00:31:52.497">- What I need to do is cut it in a way.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:52.497" end="00:31:55.070">But if you feel you still don't like it,<br/>come back.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:55.070" end="00:31:56.195">You can take it back.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:56.195" end="00:31:59.062">- Vidal walked into the salon<br/>and will be working</p>
      <p begin="00:31:59.062" end="00:32:03.542">and there will be quite a buzz going on<br/>but, he'd walk in and suddenly</p>
      <p begin="00:32:03.542" end="00:32:10.592">there would be a bit of a hush until<br/>he goes, "First client in the chair."</p>
      <p begin="00:32:10.592" end="00:32:14.513">And his assistant was there<br/>with his scissors and his combs</p>
      <p begin="00:32:14.513" end="00:32:17.459">and then the tempo would<br/>pick back up again</p>

      <p begin="00:32:18.753" end="00:32:19.797">Alright, he's in.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:19.797" end="00:32:20.654">He's settled.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:20.654" end="00:32:22.243">He's crimping. We're in.</p>

      <p begin="00:32:25.515" end="00:32:28.167">rather than what they ask for?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.167" end="00:32:31.745">- Well, the work is technical,<br/>but on the other hand</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.745" end="00:32:33.826">it is instinctive as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:33.826" end="00:32:36.965">And if your instincts tell you that<br/>what you're doing is wrong,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:36.965" end="00:32:39.895">then you mustn't do it because<br/>you're gonna make a bad job of it.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:39.895" end="00:32:42.464">I think that makes sense in anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:42.464" end="00:32:45.551">- [Client] It takes a long time to grow<br/>out, surely if somebody complains</p>
      <p begin="00:32:45.551" end="00:32:47.123">you're really in trouble.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.123" end="00:32:52.069">- Uhmm, that's true, I mean, I think that<br/>people who are trying</p>
      <p begin="00:32:52.069" end="00:32:55.798">to do something a little different<br/>more often go out on a limb.</p>

      <p begin="00:33:01.418" end="00:33:02.843">I think it works that way.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:02.843" end="00:33:07.736">- His creativity was at epic level.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07.736" end="00:33:11.217">It was just -- everything he did,<br/>every section he thought</p>
      <p begin="00:33:11.217" end="00:33:15.011">he was like a piece of art in motion.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:15.011" end="00:33:19.330">- It's like listening to music<br/>or you know having a great meal.</p>

      <p begin="00:36:06.482" end="00:36:09.959">Because nobody could do a haircut<br/>to the perfection of Vidal.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09.959" end="00:36:14.260">So he would pick the hair up<br/>[mocking Vidal].</p>
      <p begin="00:36:14.260" end="00:36:17.866">And he'd go over this haircut, and<br/>he'll say, "You've gotta get it right,"</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17.866" end="00:36:20.788">and you've gotta pull that hair.<br/>You've gotta put tension on the hair."</p>

      <p begin="00:36:29.902" end="00:36:32.504">He has this kind of whispering thing.</p>

      <p begin="00:37:07.532" end="00:37:10.479">She came in, gorgeous girl.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:10.479" end="00:37:14.148">With four feet of hair down her back.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:14.148" end="00:37:16.551">Her producer, her manager --<br/>it was a whole team.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16.551" end="00:37:18.084">We took over the 2nd floor.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:18.084" end="00:37:21.025">And I started to carve<br/>into this head of hair.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:21.025" end="00:37:25.545">And I saw by bringing<br/>the back up slightly.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:25.545" end="00:37:30.891">And keeping the length of the sides.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30.891" end="00:37:32.419">Not four feet.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:32.419" end="00:37:34.696">But keeping length of the sides,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:34.696" end="00:37:39.419">You get a great angle from the side<br/>and she could shake it.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:39.419" end="00:37:40.777">It would fall in.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40.777" end="00:37:42.844">Well, she was petrified.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:42.844" end="00:37:48.070">She played chess with her manager<br/>while all this was -- she couldn't look.</p>

      <p begin="00:37:50.842" end="00:37:54.674">And I said to my assistant, I said,<br/>"Would you please get Terry Stone</p>

      <p begin="00:37:57.361" end="00:37:59.460">So Terry gets on the line.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:59.460" end="00:38:02.227">Terry, I think we got something.</p>

      <p begin="00:38:07.871" end="00:38:10.136">He said, "Yes."</p>
      <p begin="00:38:10.136" end="00:38:14.433">And the architectural sense<br/>of what we were doing,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:14.433" end="00:38:16.192">making a statement.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:16.192" end="00:38:18.277">That's what matters.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.277" end="00:38:20.075">Making a statement.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:20.075" end="00:38:22.478">And got it off perfectly.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.478" end="00:38:25.926">I mean that picture went to<br/>American Vogue, to English Vogue,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.926" end="00:38:27.975">to Italian Vogue.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:27.975" end="00:38:30.248">It went first to all the Vogue's<br/>then the papers picked it up.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.248" end="00:38:35.277">I knew then, we are on to something.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:38.658" end="00:38:42.486">- [man talking] I think the five-point,<br/>It was part of the most famous haircut,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:42.486" end="00:38:43.482">the most photographed.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:43.482" end="00:38:47.246">The model in the five-point haircut<br/>is Grace Coddington,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:47.246" end="00:38:50.751">who went on to become Creative Director<br/>at American Vogue,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50.751" end="00:38:52.278">and has been for a long time.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:52.278" end="00:38:55.582">- [Grace] At that time, I had hair<br/>a little bit longer than it is now.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:55.582" end="00:39:01.299">Vidal was like, super smooth<br/>and he had this gentle voice</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.299" end="00:39:04.336">and-uhm-he sort of sat me down.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:04.336" end="00:39:08.350">And I guess he liked my hair<br/>because he started cutting it and...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:08.350" end="00:39:11.653">Where there great joy for a moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:11.653" end="00:39:14.505">Especially, you know when the<br/>five-point cut really worked.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.505" end="00:39:18.791">And Clare Rendlesham gave it<br/>a whole middle of quaint in two- ages.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:19.927" end="00:39:28.135">And -- those exciting moments but the lead<br/>up to it could be terribly frustrating.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:30.210" end="00:39:37.994">Five-point cut for me was the epitome<br/>of nine years of work that led up to it.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:37.994" end="00:39:47.302">It was the last cut of geometry<br/>that in essence covered the whole head</p>
      <p begin="00:39:47.302" end="00:39:53.507">because you have to create the points,<br/>here, depending on bone structure</p>
      <p begin="00:39:53.507" end="00:39:58.076">where it was on the individual character<br/>working on</p>
      <p begin="00:39:58.076" end="00:40:02.408">and you send the point in the back<br/>of the head and the two --</p>
      <p begin="00:40:02.408" end="00:40:04.539">so that you actually have five points.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.539" end="00:40:09.888">- Then I remember feeling the back and<br/>feeling that you know it's cut right out</p>
      <p begin="00:40:09.888" end="00:40:12.500">into -- into the hairline.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:12.500" end="00:40:14.492">That was pretty revolutionary.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.492" end="00:40:18.421">And it's kinda finished and he said<br/>"Stand up, okay. Shake it.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:18.421" end="00:40:22.825">and it was shhhh...you know,<br/>and it was extraordinary.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:22.825" end="00:40:27.728">- The thing about it was,<br/>that the hair itself when it was brushed</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27.728" end="00:40:32.977">anyway or you put your fingers<br/>through it had to fall back perfectly.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:32.977" end="00:40:38.343">Five-point cut was the essential<br/>geometric shape.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:38.343" end="00:40:44.736">&#9834; [music] &#9834;</p>

      <p begin="00:40:46.007" end="00:40:47.131">I mean, he put me there.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:47.131" end="00:40:50.952">You know, that was him<br/>and Mary Quant, too.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.952" end="00:40:53.935">And they're kinda of synonymous really<br/>with that moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:53.935" end="00:40:57.296">You know I think the mini-skirt<br/>is very connected</p>
      <p begin="00:40:57.296" end="00:41:02.909">to Vidal and how he saw her.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:02.909" end="00:41:06.242">- [Gordon] Mary Quant was credited with<br/>creating the mini-skirt.</p>

      <p begin="00:41:10.784" end="00:41:14.462">The interesting about Mary and Vidal<br/>was that they collaborated.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:14.462" end="00:41:17.380">She was walking down Bond Street and<br/>she happen to look at her little window</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17.380" end="00:41:18.978">and there was a photograph<br/>in it of a hairstyle</p>
