-<i>[Harold Leighton] There was this </i>
change happening.

300
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,499
And Vidal was doing things 
that they weren't doing.

301
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:53,558
Raymond was cutting sharp.

302
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:57,859
But I think after 
Vidal came out of Raymond

303
00:18:57,859 --> 00:18:59,995
and went to Bond Street,

304
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:03,017
he was cutting even sharper.

305

-<i> Hair is nature's biggest compliment</i>
and the treatment of this compliment

<i>is in our hands.</i>

307
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:16,696
<i>As in haute couture, </i>
the cut is the most important element

308
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:18,710
<i>in deciding line.</i>

309
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:25,979
<i>Hair cutting simply means design.</i>

310
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:31,457
<i>And this feeling for design</i>
must come from within.

311
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:34,395
You know when I started my own small...

312
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:36,678
It was a small business in Bond Street.

313
00:19:36,678 --> 00:19:43,387
108 New Bond Street in 1954, 
was 700 square feet,

314
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:47,559
and the first day 
we had about three clients.

315
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,333
It was you know [chuckles] 
we grew very, very slowly.

316
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:58,426
But I made up my mind then,
that if I was going to be in hairdressing,

317
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:02,365
long term, I wanted to change things.

318
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:06,961
<i>I didn't have a picture</i>
of what hair should be,

319
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:10,667

of what hair shouldn't be.

- [Maurice Tidy] Great people know 
who'd come in that time.

321
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:18,448
The type of work that 
people know us for, did not exist.

322
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:22,299
<i>At that time we were doing more, </i>

00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:25,697
<i>You tease it.</i>

326
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:27,256
<i>And put it in place.</i>

327
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:29,916
<i>And if it didn't stay for a week</i>
you were in big trouble.

328
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:35,439
- [Lawrence Taylor] In the '54, 
he was really starting to experiment

329
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:38,121
and look for where 
his direction was going.

330
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:39,605
<i>Some days, if the cut wasn't going right,</i>

331
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,602
<i>he'd throw the brush and comb</i>
up in the air,

332
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:45,273
<i>and leave the building</i>
and we wouldn't see him again.

333
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:47,967
He was crazy, actually.

334
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:52,651
He was crazy, oh, he was crazy
when clients would touch their hair.

335
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,383
<i>Whether they would touch it and say, </i>
"Oh that looks nice."

336
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:59,115
But before they could get that 
"looks nice out,"

337
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:04,242
Vidal would smash among the knuckles
with a comb.

338
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:08,355
So when a client got a rap
on the knuckles.

339
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:10,223
It was a rap on the knuckles.

340

<i>When i was frustrated about the work.</i>

342
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:20,765
I actually did once throw my scissors 
in the air and got stuck in the ceiling.

343
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:24,789
So, I took it as as omen

<i> "You see something there </i>
that you can read on the podium?

449
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:06,780
<i>I said, "Yes."</i>

450
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,018
She said, "Enunciate."

451
00:28:09,018 --> 00:28:11,056
Just the one word.

452
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,093
And there was something for me to read.

453
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:15,427
So, I enunciated.

454
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:22,225
And she said, "My God! It's bloody awful! 
But I think I can do something with you."

455
00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:26,743
So, for three years, when I was in town,
wasn't out doing shows,

456
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:31,152
I was going to Iris Warren. 
She was working on the vowels.

457
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:33,753
And it does work, it does help.

458
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,351
It wasn't just the production of voice.

459
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:39,653
It was when to keep it low.

460
00:28:39,653 --> 00:28:44,346
When to bring the audience in
and when to modulate your audio.

461
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:45,937
It was totally fascinating.

462
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:51,035
*It gave me the sense anyway
that I could speak to a crowd of people

463
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:53,475
and bring them in to what I was saying,

464
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:55,103
and have them understand.

465
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:58,120
And it proved incredibly valuable.

466
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,546
Had I gone to college, 
I would have definitely been an Architect.

467
00:29:03,546 --> 00:29:06,205
That would have been my dream, 
to be an Architect.

468
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,830
<i>Nineteen fifty-four, </i>
we worked in a very small salon.

469
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,895
I was 26 then, and after two years,
became far too small.

470
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:16,589
It was a work-up 
on the third floor virtually.

471
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:24,567
<i>Then we moved to a much larger salon</i>
in Bond Street posh end as they say.

472
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:29,058
<i>First, we did a white salon </i>
with a black boutique.

473
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:33,179
<i>And then later, we turned the whole salon</i>
into brown,

474
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,177
<i>with just steel bars in the front.</i>

475
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:37,307
<i>It looked like a hairdressing salon.</i>

476
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:39,603
<i>It looked like a modern art gallery.</i>

477
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:42,648
♪ [music] ♪

478
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:46,302
As we were changing everything,
there's change of salons as well.

479
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:48,371
So we changed the look of the salon.

480
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:53,104
- There was his fabulous photographs on 
the wall as a collection of photographs.

481
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:56,357
The tables were very modern.

482
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:57,366
Everything was modern.

483
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:58,352
It was open.

484
00:29:58,352 --> 00:30:00,845
You could see from the street
into the salon.

485
00:30:00,845 --> 00:30:03,740
Now in those days, that was very unusual.

486
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,684
That people would actually be seen
getting their hair done

487
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:07,524
was a revolution.

488
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:12,579
- And people were walking around 
with a sort of a [snapping fingers] buzz.

489
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:13,960
A click.

490
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,775
And, it sort of created
a soar of excitement.

491
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:21,293
- And there was a mezzanine floor
with all these women standing.

492
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:22,915
Hundreds of people in there.

493
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:24,943
It was very difficult even to get 
to the receptionist

494
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:27,464
because it was just 
so many people in the shop.

495
00:30:27,464 --> 00:30:29,252
- There was a hush in the salon.

496
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:30,792
You hear the snapping of scissors.

497
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:32,880
You hear -- not much chat going on.

498
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,704
It wasn't like a heavy-gossipy place.

499
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:37,805
It was like quite intense.

500
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:41,488
-<i>In this classy salon,</i>
boys fresh from Stretton in the suburbs,

501
00:30:41,488 --> 00:30:44,693
<i>give their long-suffering customers</i>
not what they want

502
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:47,730
<i>but what Vidal Sassoon </i>
believes they should have.

503
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,961
- You're not gonna cut my hair forward,
are you?

504
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:58,633
- [Vidal] Well, Lynda, when you came in,
I noticed that your hair was combed back.

505
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,496
- Yes, I like it combed back,
it's more flattering.

506
00:31:00,496 --> 00:31:02,255
I'd rather it went back from there.

507
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:03,961
- Why do you want it combed back?
Give me one good reason.

508
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,884
- Well, it gives me height up there.

509
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:07,025
- So, all your worrying 
about its height really.

510
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:07,794
- Yes.

511
00:31:07,794 --> 00:31:10,895
- Not the fact that it goes
back or forward but height.

512
00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:11,827
- It's what I've always had 
it going back there.

513
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:13,841
- Ahh, we don't go what you've always had.

514
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,997
Listen to me one moment.

515
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:19,979
When you came in, because your hair 
was combed back and grows forward

516
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:25,594
what you were getting here was a part,
but it was an unintentional part.

517
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:31,598
My feeling is that if your hair
is shaped the way it grows.

518
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:35,853
Listen, [chuckling] 
if it's shaped the way it grows

519
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:38,850
and you have your height put into it

520
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,540
right across the hair,
you are gonna get a much more defined

521
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,739
and better shape.

522
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:46,000
You'll get all the height you need
and the shape of the head

523
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,764
will actually look better.

524
00:31:47,764 --> 00:31:48,862
Try this way.

525
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:49,851
- Alright.

526
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:52,497
- What I need to do is cut it in a way.

527
00:31:52,497 --> 00:31:55,070
But if you feel you still don't like it, 
come back.

528
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,195
You can take it back.

529
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:59,062
- Vidal walked into the salon
and will be working

530
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:03,542
and there will be quite a buzz going on
but, he'd walk in and suddenly

531
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:10,592
there would be a bit of a hush until 
he goes, "First client in the chair."

532
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:14,513
<i>And his assistant was there</i>
with his scissors and his combs

533
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:17,459
<i>and then the tempo would </i>
pick back up again

534
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:18,753
<i>as he got going.</i>

535
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:19,797
<i>Alright, he's in.</i>

536
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:20,654
He's settled.

537
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:22,243
He's crimping. We're in.

538
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:23,142
We're on again.

539
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:25,515
- [Client] Do you always insist 
on giving people what you think is right

540
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:28,167
rather than what they ask for?

541
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:31,745
- Well, the work is technical,
but on the other hand

542
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:33,826
it is instinctive as well.

543
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,965
And if your instincts tell you that
what you're doing is wrong,

544
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:39,895
then you mustn't do it because
you're gonna make a bad job of it.

545
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:42,464
I think that makes sense in anything.

546
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:45,551
- [Client] It takes a long time to grow 
out, surely if somebody complains

547
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:47,123
you're really in trouble.

548
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:52,069
- Uhmm, that's true, I mean, I think that 
people who are trying

549
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:55,798
to do something a little different
more often go out on a limb.

550
00:32:55,818 --> 00:32:58,759
If you're not trying to be safe 
all the time, on the other hand,

551
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,418
you're going to be more progressive 
and get more done.

552
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:02,843
I think it works that way.

553
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:07,736
- His creativity was at epic level.

554
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,217
It was just -- everything he did,
every section he thought

555
00:33:11,217 --> 00:33:15,011
he was like a piece of art in motion.

556
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:19,330
- It's like listening to music
or you know having a great meal.

557
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,106
You know, you know, or seeing Vidal work.

558
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:28,145
<i>There was something magic about </i>
how Vidal was because he would dance.

559
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:31,878
- Most people when they cut hair, 
they cut with this comb and scissors.

560
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:34,279
Vidal cut with his whole body.

561
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,723
- He would move.

562
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,973
He would sweat, he would make faces.

563
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:40,869
He would cut hair with snip, snip, snip!

564
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:46,262
- Vidal was in his patent leather 
slippers, with his tight trousers.

565
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:48,117
He was dancing around the chair.

566
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:49,980
He was pulling faces.

567
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,176
- [Client] Do you have one particular 
kind of style that you put every year

568
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:57,777
or is it just anything that suits anybody?

569
00:33:57,777 --> 00:34:00,411
- Well, that's a difficult one to answer.

570
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,349
I think each year we try 
to bring out something.

571
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:05,577
We try to innovate something 
a little different.

572
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:08,358
- [Client] Yup, this is alright for 
somebody my age or older.

573
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:10,369
But what happens to someone 
20 years older?

574
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:11,543
It can't work for everyone.

575
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:12,608
[scissors snipping]

576
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:16,506
- The VMA's however -- every line, 
whether it be hair or clothes.

577
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:18,665
[scissors snipping]

578
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,698
A client would take something from it.

579
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:22,897
There is always something 
that they can take from it.

580
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:25,241
Even if they don't have the actual right.

581
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:31,884
- [Client] There must be an awful lot of 
turned bad from here in that case.

582
00:34:31,884 --> 00:34:35,944
- Am gonna let you stew in that one
am not gonna answer it. [laughing]

583
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:39,148
- [Client] I hope you're not snipping 
too much off in revenge.

584
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:43,325
- Vidal made everybody nervous, 
especially me.

585
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:45,814
I would feel instantly sweat 
coming all over me.

586
00:34:45,814 --> 00:34:47,983
And you know, your hands
would start shaking.

587
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:51,532
- We were told never 
to call the clients "madame."

588
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:54,086
Always to call the clients "madam."

589
00:34:54,086 --> 00:34:56,443
We were told to open the door
for the client.

590
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:58,447
We were told to call the taxi 
for the client.

591
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:00,397
We were told to get the lunch
for the client.

592
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:08,863
- He would not tolerate any, anything
that wasn't up to scratch.

593
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:14,848
If you did look the part, that's it, you 
just-- you went-- you're out of the door.

594
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:18,678
If you hadn't cleaned your shoes that day,
boy! you know that's it, you are out

595
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:21,882
you weren't there, 
you're just out the door.

596
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:25,181
- And there I was doing this haircut
and I'm pulling the hair out,

597
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:27,401
and I could feel him behind.

598
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:33,879
And not only do I feel him behind, but
I could hear him going snip, snip, snip.

599
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:39,120
As I was cutting he was going snip,
snip, snip. Snip, snip, snip.

600
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,060
And it was freaking me out.

601
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,461
- I remember one time, he sent me home
because my shoes were not polished.

602
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:49,628
He's just you know, he was very strict.

603
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:54,364
Every time I assisted him, 
if I got distracted for a second

604
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:56,582
he would take his comb,
he would snap my hand

605
00:35:56,582 --> 00:35:57,995
and said, "put attention."

606
00:35:57,995 --> 00:36:02,688
- Well, for Vidal to check your haircut
was the end of life.

607
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,482
Because you knew, he was gonna find 
something wrong with it.

608
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:09,959
Because nobody could do a haircut 
to the perfection of Vidal.

609
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:14,260
So he would pick the hair up 
[mocking Vidal].

610
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,866
And he'd go over this haircut, and 
he'll say, "You've gotta get it right,"

611
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:20,788
and you've gotta pull that hair. 
You've gotta put tension on the hair."

612
00:36:20,788 --> 00:36:24,409
"Move your body. Cut it again."

613
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:28,016
- But you know when -- the thing is,
you knew when he was tough

614
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:29,902
when his voice is lowered.

615
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:32,504
He has this kind of whispering thing.

616
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:37,338
And it's a, "I don't think 
you are right for here."

617
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:39,828
"You don't seem to understand it."

618
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:43,883
*So i suggest you go that way
and don't come back again."

619
00:36:43,883 --> 00:36:47,147
But the minute that voice is lowered,
you know that was it.

up to it could be terribly frustrating.

671
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:37,994
Five-point cut for me was the epitome
of nine years of work that led up to it.

672
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:47,302
It was the last cut of geometry 
that in essence covered the whole head

673
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:53,507
because you have to create the points, 
here, depending on bone structure

674
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:58,076
<i>where it was on the individual character</i>
working on

675
00:39:58,076 --> 00:40:02,408

of the head and the two --

676
00:40:02,408 --> 00:40:04,539
<i>so that you actually have five points.</i>

677
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:09,888
- Then I remember feeling the back and 
feeling that you know it's cut right out

678

<i>into -- into the hairline.</i>

679
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,492
<i>That was pretty revolutionary.</i>

680
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:18,421

"Stand up, okay. Shake it.

Most of my progressive thoughts
