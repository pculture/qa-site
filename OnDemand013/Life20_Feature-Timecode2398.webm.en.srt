a lot of married men —
straight married men

324
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:35,432
who are in Second Life
to play gay boys, for whatever reason

325
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:38,277
and very often they don't know
themselves why.

326
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,031
- He has an addictive personality.

327
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,452
and this could very easily
become a problem, if it isn't already.

00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,082
He's spending a lot of time
on Second Life.

329
00:29:53,458 --> 00:30:01,758
I think it becomes a problem
when you ignore your first life.

330
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,804
He used to be able to work
in his office with the door open

331
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,265
and I could pop in
and we could have a conversation

332
00:30:08,796 --> 00:30:11,134
or we could, you know,
he could take a break

333
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:13,988
and we could go do something.

334
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,642
And suddenly, when he was
on Second Life

335
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:24,250
the door was closed
and there was a different feel.

336
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,318
*When the door is closed I just assume*

337
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:29,277
*that he's either working on something*

338
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,954
*that's very important that he needs
to focus on*

339
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:38,003
*or more likely he is on Second Life.*

340
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:42,711
*And chances are he is
with the female avatar.*

341
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,126
And since he knows
that I don't want to know much about it,

342
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,265
I think he assumes that at this point
he should keep it to himself.

if she's ready to hear a little bit more

out of having a female child avatar

I'm not certain as to what that is,

348

[typing on keyboard]

361
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:18,812
One of the things that I learned from her
is that nothing is ever enough.

362
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,950
And nothing was ever enough for her,
her family, her friends,

363
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,004
and the things she was doing.

364
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:28,731
She always wanted more
and she always wanted new things.

365
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:31,367
And she never stopped
and finished anything.

366
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:35,245
By watching her go through that
over and over again,

367
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,528
and never be happy with what she had,

368
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:43,098
I was able to see that I am
exactly the same way.

369
00:32:43,114 --> 00:32:45,575
And that's how I moved from
having this great real life,

370
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,801
which is amazing and
I was very thankful for

371
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,839
to pursuing this Second Life
for this other part of me

372
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,592
that I really didn't have time for.

373
00:32:57,592 --> 00:33:01,730
I'm putting everything at risk right now,
my family, and my future, and my job

374
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:06,181
and even my health, probably because
I don't sleep very much.

did you check out the depot?

*- [Tea] I came home from college,
quite a few years ago*

400
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,767
and moved back to help around here
because both of them kind of got ill

401
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,416
at the same time.

402
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:43,236
And because of my mom's cooking
I've never left. [laughing]

403
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,366
We just are really close family.

404
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,552
So, living under the same roof,
we help out each other a lot.

405
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:00,044
And I've been sick on and off
for the last few years,

406
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:03,164
so it goes both ways.

407
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:08,315
- We don't know her by her online entity.
We know her as our baby sister.

408
00:35:08,762 --> 00:35:11,818
So, we call her Tea or TC.

409
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:19,159
- She's out-going. She is quirky.
She is funny. She is artistic.

410
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,863
And she demonstrates all
the artistic qualities

411
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:28,282
of a person who lives her life that way.

412
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:32,297
- When I had my graphic design company,
I had a small little vice

413
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,549
and my vice was video games.

414
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:40,388
I love them. I love to play them.
I love to explore them.

415
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:46,221
The only problem is I cannot justify
spending time away from my real job

416
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:51,512
or my family to do something
that doesn't make money.

417
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:57,439
And when I found Second Life and it did,
wow, I was sold.

418
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,783
I was stuck. I was hooked.

419
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:05,413
- Well, she makes more money than we do
so, you know, in that sense, yeah.

420
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,333
She's a lot smarter than we are.

421
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:17,342
- I've been well into the six figure income
and being able to do something you love

422
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:23,515
and still be at home with your family,
that's pretty much changed my life.

423
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:31,272
My brother, Steve, I think at times
he's a little jealous of Second Life.

424
00:36:32,428 --> 00:36:33,850
- Jealous? Maybe a little.

425
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:38,553
I have to go to work.
I work 12 hour shifts.

00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:59,919
In September of 2007. Teasa Copprue
otherwise known as Asri Falcone

523
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:04,869
came to me for some help with a problem
that was affecting her business.

524
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:08,622
- I started getting reports that my items
were being spread around the world

525
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:14,662
*at yard sales and things like that
by people who I had no knowledge*

526
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:17,181
*of buying my items.*

527
00:45:19,735 --> 00:45:25,715
So, it turned out that they had actually
been stolen and copied and distributed

528
00:45:25,715 --> 00:45:28,342
without my permission.

529
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:32,540
- [Frank] The belief was that these avatars

530
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:38,602
were taking advantage of a flaw
in the software underlying Second Life.

*resides on a computer server.*

533
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:51,532
And sometimes for various reasons
for maintenance and also unexpectedly,

534
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:56,745
*the island or the Sim would crash.*

535
00:45:56,745 --> 00:46:01,709
*When Linden restored that island
or that simulation,*

536
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:04,921
*sometimes there'd be a duplicate
of those objects made.*

537
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:08,925
So, if you did it in a systematic way,
you did it one time, you'd have two

538
00:46:08,925 --> 00:46:14,972
*you did again, you'd have four*
and eight and 16 and 32 and 64.

539
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:19,435
The situation went a lot further
than just Asri.

540
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:21,798
There were a number of merchants

541
00:46:21,798 --> 00:46:24,161
who believed that they were
being affected

542
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:26,526
by this copying,

543
00:46:26,526 --> 00:46:34,242
*and they kept seeing Grace Kenzo
as the person making the copies.*

544

Pretty quickly, in doing some research,

545
00:46:36,952 --> 00:46:41,416

was an item you could see in the world*

761
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:29,535
*that consisted of graphics*

762
01:07:29,535 --> 01:07:34,411
and sometimes there'd be animation
and sounds associated with it.

763
01:07:34,411 --> 01:07:38,829
So, I knew that those types of works 
were protectable as pictorial

764
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:41,681
or audio visual works 
under the *Copyright Act.*

765
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:47,049
And I knew also, that underlying 
all that was a couple of things,

766
01:07:47,049 --> 01:07:52,520
*the machine readable zeros and ones,
and also the human readable source code*

767
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:58,487
and both types of code were protectable
as literary works under the copyright laws.

768
01:07:58,487 --> 01:08:03,323

Well, the complaint talks about Asri's items
at paragraph 56.

777
01:08:50,183 --> 01:08:53,991
And it says, in pertinent part,

778
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:56,482
"Two of these products are known 
as CFM boots,"

779
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:58,290
that's item number one

780
01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:04,928
and "Celine Boots," item number two.

781
01:09:04,928 --> 01:09:08,777
Exhibit H is the CFM boots.
That stands for *Cum Fuk Me* boots.

- Eventually,
we reached a settlement with Mr. Simon

786
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:29,673
and it contained an injunction
against further copying

787
01:09:29,673 --> 01:09:35,099
and also required Mr. Simon 
to pay $525 back to my clients.

*That was what he admitted that he made
selling my clients virtual items.*

789
01:09:41,943 --> 01:09:47,191
The most important takeaway here
when we look back 10 years, 20 years out

790
01:09:47,191 --> 01:09:52,719
is not so much the $525, in my opinion.

791
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,754
It means that virtual worlds are 
legitimately part of the real world.

792
01:09:58,754 --> 01:10:01,515
They are governed by the laws 
of the real world

793

- Why not?

01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:34,036
- Because it's you.

837
01:13:34,036 --> 01:13:39,488
You can't blame something that
you have control over.

838
01:13:43,258 --> 01:13:49,128
We both used it to our advantage
to not deal with the problems.

- But you felt like it was a problem?

840
01:13:55,376 --> 01:13:59,956
- No. Again, there were plenty 
of other issues there.

841
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:02,673
Some that we had dealt with and 
some that we are still dealing with

842
01:14:02,673 --> 01:14:04,828
but there are plenty 
of issues still there --

843
01:14:04,828 --> 01:14:05,723
- Uh-hm.

844
01:14:05,723 --> 01:14:07,929
- but Second Life was your escape

845
01:14:07,929 --> 01:14:13,249
and it was my chance to have more time
to think or to have more time to...

846
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:16,412
- It's also something that I tried to talk to you.

847
01:14:16,412 --> 01:14:19,909
Second Life is something
I've tried to talk to you about a ton of times.

848
01:14:19,909 --> 01:14:28,780
And, yeah, you weren't interested
but for me I found parts of myself

849
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:32,822
that I really needed you to understand.

853
01:14:37,605 --> 01:14:40,288
*is that I didn't wanna understand.*

854
01:14:40,288 --> 01:14:41,968
- Umm,

855
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:47,088
*- Like me not wanting 
to understand Second Life,*

856

*to you translated into "She doesn't 
wanna understand me."*

01:14:51,385 --> 01:14:53,411
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely, absolutely.

858
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:56,310
Yeah, you roll your eyes when you say that

859

but I'm not the only person
that has found themselves there.

And you think that crazy, I know.

861
01:15:03,856 --> 01:15:07,109
I can tell you by the way you're looking at me.

01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:08,711

*maybe it wasn't but I think
that right now*

868
01:15:22,306 --> 01:15:24,614

Second Life defines you.*

870
01:15:26,614 --> 01:15:30,597
- No, no, absolutely not. I define myself there.

871
01:15:30,597 --> 01:15:33,311
- You define yourself there.

872
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:38,202
So, yeah. I'm not there.

873

so I don't fit into that equation.*

01:15:58,418 --> 01:16:04,064
- I was willing to give up anything 
to make it work, and um...

875
01:16:06,341 --> 01:16:09,986
one thing this whole experience
taught me was

876
01:16:11,862 --> 01:16:13,599
that I had given up so much of myself

877
01:16:13,599 --> 01:16:15,845
that I was looking for myself
in other places.

878
01:16:24,826 --> 01:16:27,551
My fiancee moved out immediately
when we broke up.

879
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:31,141
She went to stay with her parents.

882
01:16:44,594 --> 01:16:51,724
- [Amie] I really want these boxes
but I'm not ready to just chuck them.

883
01:16:51,724 --> 01:16:58,085
- Since I've arrived, the task I had really 
is just trying to establish

884
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:01,230
a sense of home for me.

885
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:04,847
It's not awkward but, you know,

886
01:17:04,847 --> 01:17:10,172
I'm moving into Amie and her daughter's
house and home.

887
01:17:10,172 --> 01:17:14,964
And, you know, there are all the
established routines and stuff, you know,

888
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:19,425
sometimes it's junk,
sometimes it's actual treasures.

889
01:17:19,425 --> 01:17:20,420
Would that work?

890
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,249
*- No.*

891
01:17:21,249 --> 01:17:22,739
- No?

892
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:24,186
- Ughh!

893
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:28,141
There's a lot of emotion 
attached to some —

894
01:17:28,141 --> 01:17:31,689
a lot of the items that are here
that should be purged.

895
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:37,478
What if we moved the boxes back here
that are Jimmy's into the garage?

896
01:17:37,478 --> 01:17:40,114
My husband has been out of the house
for six months now,

897
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:44,443
and he has not removed 
all of his items yet.

898
01:17:44,443 --> 01:17:46,546
Okay, that's Jimmy's.

899
01:17:46,546 --> 01:17:50,868
*And, it's difficult to see that around*

900
01:17:50,868 --> 01:17:53,848
*and I'm sure it doesn't feel
very comfortable for Steven.*

901
01:17:55,234 --> 01:17:57,093
This is Jimmy's.

902
01:17:59,632 --> 01:18:02,438
*This is Jimmy's shoes that can go on...*
*- [Steven] This is terrible.*

903
01:18:02,438 --> 01:18:03,906
*- Why?*

904
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,302
*- Are we just gonna stick 
this stuff in the garage*

905
01:18:08,302 --> 01:18:12,821
or are we gonna take 
the effort to just do it?

906
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:14,434
*- Put it in the garage. 
What do you suggest?*

907
01:18:14,434 --> 01:18:16,073
- I mean, just throw it away.

908
01:18:16,073 --> 01:18:17,540
*- No, we're not going to 
throw it away on him.*

909
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:18,639
- Okay.

1062
01:29:42,436 --> 01:29:47,824
And it was very convenient for me
to assume that I was lucky.

1063
01:29:49,424 --> 01:29:55,571
But, this memory always came back
and it was something I ignored.

1064
01:29:56,971 --> 01:30:02,900
By pretending it didn't happen,
it didn't make the anger go away.

1065
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:09,682
It was there anyway
and it found it's way out through Ayya.

1066
01:30:26,931 --> 01:30:30,628
- Okay. You there?

1067
01:30:30,628 --> 01:30:32,249
Okay.

1068
01:30:32,249 --> 01:30:39,797
Since we last talked, you know, 
the big change is

1069
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:46,113
I'm no longer in New York,
I'm now back in Calgary.

1070
01:30:46,113 --> 01:30:47,139
You know, my intention was

1071
01:30:47,139 --> 01:30:50,144
to try to seek employment
in New York

1072
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:52,275
but immigration and work status

1073
01:30:52,275 --> 01:30:55,526
and all that is proving 
a little difficult also.

1074
01:30:55,935 --> 01:30:59,696
I'm not sure if I said this back 
in the beginning of the summer

1075
01:30:59,696 --> 01:31:03,263
when we filmed in New York.

1076
01:31:03,263 --> 01:31:05,642
You know, it was a good 
test period for us.

1077
01:31:05,642 --> 01:31:07,506
And we had a lot of ups and downs.

1078
01:31:07,506 --> 01:31:11,509
And again, primarily, the stress 
of the divorce

1079
01:31:11,509 --> 01:31:17,959
and the battle between 
her husband and the child and me

1080
01:31:17,959 --> 01:31:21,184
you know, all trying 
to make that work out

1081
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:25,962
now that we've worked through it, 
we're now...

1082
01:31:25,962 --> 01:31:27,209
You know, we're committed.

1083
01:31:27,209 --> 01:31:31,009
We're, Amie and I, are committed
to one another.

1084
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:34,478
We did the long distance relationship
for quite some time.

1085
01:31:34,478 --> 01:31:39,060
So, I don't want to do it 
for a long time again

1086
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:43,957
but if that's what it takes,
that's what we're gonna do.

- [Philip] Having thought about this 
for some time

1125
01:35:46,697 --> 01:35:49,907
and having seen, you know, everything

1126

unfolding and growing in Second Life

1127
01:35:51,677 --> 01:35:56,499
I would say that to a certain extent,
the virtual world must contain some

1128
01:35:56,499 --> 01:36:00,263
sort of danger and risk
and possibility of pain or loss

1129
01:36:00,263 --> 01:36:01,853
to be interesting.

1130
01:36:01,853 --> 01:36:06,651
I don't think that we can create 
worlds of any kind that aren't —

1131
01:36:06,651 --> 01:36:09,070
that are interesting without them 
also being, you know,

1132
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:10,582
at least somewhat dangerous.

1133
01:36:10,582 --> 01:36:14,658
That said, the virtual world is 
at a basic level

1134
01:36:14,658 --> 01:36:16,572
a safer place than the real world.

1135
01:36:16,572 --> 01:36:18,935
We do not have the ability 
in the virtual world

1136
01:36:18,935 --> 01:36:20,905
to physically harm each other.

1137
01:36:20,905 --> 01:36:24,035
And that is a very powerful change
that I think brings us closer

1138
01:36:24,035 --> 01:36:27,691
to our aspiration about 
what it is to be human.

1139
01:36:27,691 --> 01:36:31,258
I think that the fact that we are 
perhaps emotionally in danger

1140
01:36:31,258 --> 01:36:32,854
but not physically in danger

1141
01:36:32,854 --> 01:36:35,862
in the virtual world is 
a tremendous positive step

1142
01:36:35,862 --> 01:36:39,479
toward being all that we can be.

1143
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:41,672
So, while the virtual world 
is not without danger

1144
01:36:41,672 --> 01:36:44,705
it's certainly a good deal safer
than the physical world

1145
01:36:44,705 --> 01:36:47,466
that we, for the most part live in now.
