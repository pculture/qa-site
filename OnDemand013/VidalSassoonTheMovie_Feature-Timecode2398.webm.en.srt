00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,781
*is in our hands.*

301
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:17,854
*As in haute couture, 
the cut is the most important element*

302
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,870
*in deciding line.*

303
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:27,147
*Hair cutting simply means design.*

304
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:32,630
*And this feeling for design
must come from within.*

305
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,571
You know when I started my own small...

306
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:37,856
It was a small business in Bond Street.

307
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:44,572
108 New Bond Street in 1954, 
was 700 square feet,

308
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:48,748
and the first day we had about three clients.

309
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:52,526
It was you know [chuckles] 
we grew very, very slowly.

310
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:59,626
But I made up my mind then,
that if I was going to be in hairdressing,

311
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:03,569
long term, I wanted to change things.

312
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:08,170
*I didn't have a picture of what hair should be,*

313
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,879
*but I had a definite picture 
of what hair shouldn't be.*

314
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,551
- [Maurice Tidy] Great people know 
who'd come in that time.

315
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:19,668
The type of work that 
people know us for, did not exist.

316
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:23,523
*At that time we were doing more, 
I would term, more traditional*

317
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,159
*side of hairdressing.*

318
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:25,941
*You set hair.*

319
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:26,924
*You tease it.*

320
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:28,485
*And put it in place.*

321
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:31,148
*And if it didn't stay for a week
you were in big trouble.*

322
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:36,676
- [Lawrence Taylor] In the '54, 
he was really starting to experiment

323
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:39,361
and look for where his direction was going.

324
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:43,846
*Some days, if the cut wasn't going right,
he'd throw the brush and comb up in the air,*

325
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:46,520
*and leave the building
and we wouldn't see him again.*

326
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,217
He was crazy, actually.

327
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:53,905
He was crazy, oh, he was crazy
when clients would touch their hair.

328
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:57,641
*Whether they would touch it and say, 
"Oh that looks nice."*

329
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:00,376
But before they could get that 
"looks nice out,"

330
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:05,508
Vidal would smash among the knuckles
with a comb.

331
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:09,625
So when a client got a rap on the knuckles.

332
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,495
It was a rap on the knuckles.

333
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:14,095
-*[Vidal] I was a naughty boy.*

*When i was frustrated about the work.*

335
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:22,048
I actually did once throw my scissors 
in the air and got stuck in the ceiling.

336
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,076
So, I took it as as omen
and went to Paris for two weeks.

337

But then came back.

But that's the only time I did that.

339
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:34,827
*Other times, I'd throw the brush down
and go for a walk,*

00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:41,375
It was when to keep it low.

452
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:46,073
When to bring the audience in
and when to modulate your audio.

453
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:47,665
It was totally fascinating.

454
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:52,768
*It gave me the sense anyway
that I could speak to a crowd of people

455
00:28:52,768 --> 00:28:55,211
and bring them in to what I was saying,

456
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:56,840
and have them understand.

457
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,860
And it proved incredibly valuable.

458
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:05,292
Had I gone to college, 
I would have definitely been an Architect.

459
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,953
That would have been my dream, 
to be an Architect.

460
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:10,581
*Nineteen fifty-four, 
we worked in a very small salon.*

461
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:15,651
I was 26 then, and after two years,
became far too small.

462
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:18,348
It was a work-up on the third floor virtually.

463
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:26,334
*Then we moved to a much larger salon
in Bond Street posh end as they say.*

464
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:30,829
*First, we did a white salon 
with a black boutique.*

465
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:36,954
*And then later, we turned the whole salon
into brown, with just steel bars in the front.*

466
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:39,087
*It looked like a hairdressing salon.*

467
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:41,385
*It looked like a modern art gallery.*

468
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:44,433
♪ [music] ♪

469
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:48,091
As we were changing everything,
there's change of salons as well.

470
00:29:48,091 --> 00:29:50,162
So we changed the look of the salon.

471
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:54,899
- There was his fabulous photographs 
on the wall as a collection of photographs.

472
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,156
The tables were very modern.

473
00:29:58,156 --> 00:29:59,166
Everything was modern.

474
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,153
It was open.

475
00:30:00,153 --> 00:30:02,648
You could see from the street
into the salon.

476
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:05,546
Now in those days, that was very unusual.

477
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:07,492
That people would actually be seen
getting their hair done

478
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:09,334
was a revolution.

479
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:14,394
- And people were walking around 
with a sort of a [snapping fingers] buzz.

480
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:15,776
A click.

481
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:19,595
And, it sort of created a soar of excitement.

482
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:23,117
- And there was a mezzanine floor
with all these women standing.

483
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:24,740
Hundreds of people in there.

484
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,770
It was very difficult even to get 
to the receptionist

485
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,294
because it was just 
so many people in the shop.

486
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,084
- There was a hush in the salon.

487
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:32,625
You hear the snapping of scissors.

488
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,715
You hear -- not much chat going on.

489
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:37,542
It wasn't like a heavy-gossipy place.

490
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:39,645
It was like quite intense.

491
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:43,332
-*In this classy salon,
boys fresh from Stretton in the suburbs,*

492
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:46,540
*give their long-suffering customers
not what they want*

493
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,580
*but what Vidal Sassoon 
believes they should have.*

494
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:54,816
- You're not gonna cut my hair forward,
are you?

495
00:30:54,816 --> 00:31:00,494
- [Vidal] Well, Lynda, when you came in,
I noticed that your hair was combed back.

496
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:02,359
- Yes, I like it combed back,
it's more flattering.

497
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,120
I'd rather it went back from there.

498
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,827
- Why do you want it combed back?
Give me one good reason.

499
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:07,752
- Well, it gives me height up there.

500
00:31:07,752 --> 00:31:08,894
- So, all your worrying about its height really.

501
00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:09,664
- Yes.

502
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:12,768
- Not the fact that it goes back or forward but height.

503
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:13,701
- It's what I've always had it going back there.

504
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:15,717
- Ahh, we don't go what you've always had.

505
00:31:15,717 --> 00:31:17,875
Listen to me one moment.

506
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,861
When you came in, because your hair 
was combed back and grows forward

507
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:27,482
what you were getting here was a part,
but it was an unintentional part.

508
00:31:27,482 --> 00:31:33,492
My feeling is that if your hair
is shaped the way it grows.

509
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:40,751
Listen, [chuckling] if it's shaped the way it grows
and you have your height put into it

510
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:44,445
right across the hair,
you are gonna get a much more defined

511
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,645
and better shape.

512
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:47,908
You'll get all the height you need
and the shape of the head

513
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,674
will actually look better.

514
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,773
Try this way.

515
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:51,763
- Alright.

516
00:31:51,763 --> 00:31:54,412
- What I need to do is cut it in a way.

517
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,987
But if you feel you still don't like it, 
come back.

518
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:58,114
You can take it back.

519
00:31:58,114 --> 00:32:00,983
- Vidal walked into the salon
and will be working

520
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:05,468
and there will be quite a buzz going on
but, he'd walk in and suddenly

521
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:12,525
there would be a bit of a hush
until he goes, "First client in the chair."

522
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:16,450
*And his assistant was there
with his scissors and his combs*

523
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,399
*and then the tempo would 
pick back up again*

524
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,694
*as he got going.*

525
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:21,739
*Alright, he's in.*

526
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,597
He's settled.

527
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:24,188
He's crimping. We're in.

528
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:25,088
We're on again.

529
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,463
- [Client] Do you always insist 
on giving people what you think is right

530
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:30,118
rather than what they ask for?

531
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:33,699
- Well, the work is technical,
but on the other hand

532
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:35,782
it is instinctive as well.

533
00:32:35,782 --> 00:32:38,924
And if your instincts tell you that
what you're doing is wrong,

534
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:41,857
then you mustn't do it because
you're gonna make a bad job of it.

535
00:32:41,857 --> 00:32:44,429
I think that makes sense in anything.

536
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,519
- [Client] It takes a long time to grow out, 
surely if somebody complains

537
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,093
you're really in trouble.

538
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:54,044
- Uhmm, that's true, I mean, I think that 
people who are trying

539
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:57,776
to do something a little different
more often go out on a limb.

540
00:32:57,796 --> 00:33:00,740
If you're not trying to be safe all the time, 
on the other hand,

541
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,402
you're going to be more progressive 
and get more done.

542
00:33:03,402 --> 00:33:04,828
I think it works that way.

543
00:33:04,828 --> 00:33:09,726
- His creativity was at epic level.

544
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:13,211
It was just -- everything he did,
every section he thought

545
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:17,009
he was like a piece of art in motion.

546
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:21,332
- It's like listening to music
or you know having a great meal.

547
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,111
You know, you know, or seeing Vidal work.

548
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:30,156
*There was something magic about 
how Vidal was because he would dance.*

549
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:33,892
- Most people when they cut hair, 
they cut with this comb and scissors.

550
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:36,296
Vidal cut with his whole body.

551
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:37,741
- He would move.

552
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:39,993
He would sweat, he would make faces.

553
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:42,892
He would cut hair with snip, snip, snip!

554
00:33:42,892 --> 00:33:48,291
- Vidal was in his patent leather slippers, 
with his tight trousers.

555
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,148
He was dancing around the chair.

556
00:33:50,148 --> 00:33:52,013
He was pulling faces.

557
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:55,212
- [Client] Do you have one particular 
kind of style that you put every year

558
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:59,817
or is it just anything that suits anybody?

559
00:33:59,817 --> 00:34:02,454
- Well, that's a difficult one to answer.

560
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,394
I think each year we try 
to bring out something.

561
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:07,625
We try to innovate something 
a little different.

562
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,409
- [Client] Yup, this is alright for somebody
my age or older.

563
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,423
But what happens to someone 
20 years older?

564
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:13,597
It can't work for everyone.

565
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:14,663
[scissors snipping]

566
00:34:14,663 --> 00:34:18,565
- The VMA's however -- every line, 
whether it be hair or clothes.

567
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:20,727
[scissors snipping]

568
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,761
A client would take something from it.

569
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,962
There is always something 
that they can take from it.

570
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,309
Even if they don't have the actual right.

571
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:33,958
- [Client] There must be an awful lot of 
turned bad from here in that case.

572
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:38,023
- Am gonna let you stew in that one
am not gonna answer it. [laughing]

573
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:41,230
- [Client] I hope you're not snipping 
too much off in revenge.

574
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,411
- Vidal made everybody nervous, 
especially me.

575
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,902
I would feel instantly sweat 
coming all over me.

576
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,075
And you know, your hands
would start shaking.

577
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:53,626
- We were told never 
to call the clients "madame."

578
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:56,183
Always to call the clients "madam."

579
00:34:56,183 --> 00:34:58,542
We were told to open the door for the client.

580
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,548
We were told to call the taxi for the client.

581
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:02,500
We were told to get the lunch for the client.

582
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:10,974
- He would not tolerate any, anything
that wasn't up to scratch.

583
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:16,965
If you did look the part, that's it, you just -- 
you went -- you're out of the door.

584
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:20,799
If you hadn't cleaned your shoes that day,
boy! you know that's it, you are out

585
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:24,007
you weren't there, you're just out the door.

586
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:27,309
- And there I was doing this haircut
and I'm pulling the hair out,

587
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:29,531
and I could feel him behind.

588
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:36,016
And not only do I feel him behind, 
but I could hear him going snip, snip, snip.

589
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:41,262
As I was cutting he was going snip, snip, snip.
Snip, snip, snip.

590
00:35:41,262 --> 00:35:44,205
And it was freaking me out.

591
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:48,610
- I remember one time, he sent me home
because my shoes were not polished.

592
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,780
He's just you know, he was very strict.

593
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,521
Every time I assisted him, 
if I got distracted for a second

594
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,741
he would take his comb,
he would snap my hand

595
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,156
and said, "put attention."

596
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:04,853
- Well, for Vidal to check your haircut
was the end of life.

597
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:08,651
Because you knew, he was gonna find 
something wrong with it.

598
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:12,132
Because nobody could do a haircut 
to the perfection of Vidal.

599
00:36:12,132 --> 00:36:16,437
So he would pick the hair up 
[mocking Vidal].

600
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:20,047
And he'd go over this haircut, and he'll say,
"You've gotta get it right,"

606

you are right for here."

* Where there great joy for a moment.*

658
00:39:14,008 --> 00:39:16,862

*And -- those exciting moments but the 
lead up to it could be terribly frustrating.*

661
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:40,375
Five-point cut for me was the epitome
of nine years of work that led up to it.

662
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:49,692
It was the last cut of geometry 
that in essence covered the whole head

663
00:39:49,692 --> 00:39:55,903
because you have to create the points, 
here, depending on bone structure

664
00:39:55,903 --> 00:40:00,477
*where it was on the individual character
working on*

665
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:04,813
*and you send the point in the back 
of the head and the two -- *

666
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:06,946
*so that you actually have five points.*

667
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:12,301
- Then I remember feeling the back
and feeling that you know it's cut right out

668
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:14,915
*into -- into the hairline.*

669
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,909
*That was pretty revolutionary.*

670
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:20,842
*And it's kinda finished and he said 
"Stand up, okay. Shake it.*

671
00:40:20,842 --> 00:40:25,251
and it was shhhh...you know, 
and it was extraordinary.

672
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:30,159
- The thing about it was,
that the hair itself when it was brushed

673
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:35,413
*anyway or you put your fingers
through it had to fall back perfectly.*

674
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:40,784

Most of my progressive thoughts

1394
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:19,704
I can remember one New Year 
at the lyceum that was big,

1395
01:25:19,704 --> 01:25:21,387
it was a dance hall.

all the revelers enjoying themselves.

In my own loneliness, there was always
this sense that I wanted to be a winner.
