-<i>[Harold Leighton] There was this </i>
change happening.

300
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:51,631
And Vidal was doing things 
that they weren't doing.

301
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,693
Raymond was cutting sharp.

302
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:58,998
But I think after 
Vidal came out of Raymond

303
00:18:58,998 --> 00:19:01,137
and went to Bond Street,

304
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:04,162
he was cutting even sharper.

305
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:09,925
-<i> Hair is nature's biggest compliment</i>
and the treatment of this compliment

306

<i>is in our hands.</i>

307
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:17,854
<i>As in haute couture, </i>
the cut is the most important element

308
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,870
<i>in deciding line.</i>

309
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:27,147
<i>Hair cutting simply means design.</i>

310
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:32,630
<i>And this feeling for design</i>
must come from within.

311
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,571
You know when I started my own small...

312
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:37,856
It was a small business in Bond Street.

313
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:44,572
108 New Bond Street in 1954, 
was 700 square feet,

314
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:48,748
and the first day 
we had about three clients.

315
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:52,526
It was you know [chuckles] 
we grew very, very slowly.

316
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:59,626
But I made up my mind then,
that if I was going to be in hairdressing,

317
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:03,569
long term, I wanted to change things.

318
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:08,170
<i>I didn't have a picture</i>
of what hair should be,

319
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,879

of what hair shouldn't be.

320
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,551
- [Maurice Tidy] Great people know 
who'd come in that time.

321
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:19,668
The type of work that 
people know us for, did not exist.

322
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:23,523
<i>At that time we were doing more, </i>
I would term, more traditional

324
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:25,941

325
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:26,924
<i>You tease it.</i>

326
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:28,485
<i>And put it in place.</i>

327
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:31,148
<i>And if it didn't stay for a week</i>
you were in big trouble.

328
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:36,676
- [Lawrence Taylor] In the '54, 
he was really starting to experiment

329
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:39,361
and look for where 
his direction was going.

330
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:40,846
<i>Some days, if the cut wasn't going right,</i>

331
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:43,846
<i>he'd throw the brush and comb</i>
up in the air,

332
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:46,520
<i>and leave the building</i>
and we wouldn't see him again.

333
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,217
He was crazy, actually.

334
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:53,905
He was crazy, oh, he was crazy
when clients would touch their hair.

335
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:57,641
<i>Whether they would touch it and say, </i>
"Oh that looks nice."

336
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:00,376
But before they could get that 
"looks nice out,"

337
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:05,508
Vidal would smash among the knuckles
with a comb.

338
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:09,625
So when a client got a rap
on the knuckles.

339
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,495
It was a rap on the knuckles.

340
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:14,095
-<i>[Vidal] I was a naughty boy.</i>

<i>When i was frustrated about the work.</i>

342
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:22,048
I actually did once throw my scissors 
in the air and got stuck in the ceiling.

343
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,076
So, I took it as as omen
and went to Paris for two weeks.

344
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,317
But then came back.

<i> "You see something there </i>
that you can read on the podium?

449
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:08,469
<i>I said, "Yes."</i>

450
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,709
She said, "Enunciate."

451
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:12,749
Just the one word.

452
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:15,789
And there was something for me to read.

453
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:17,125
So, I enunciated.

454
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:23,929
And she said, "My God! It's bloody awful! 
But I think I can do something with you."

455
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:28,452
So, for three years, when I was in town,
wasn't out doing shows,

456
00:28:28,452 --> 00:28:32,865
I was going to Iris Warren. 
She was working on the vowels.

457
00:28:32,865 --> 00:28:35,469
And it does work, it does help.

458
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:39,071
It wasn't just the production of voice.

459
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:41,375
It was when to keep it low.

460
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:46,073
When to bring the audience in
and when to modulate your audio.

461
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:47,665
It was totally fascinating.

462
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:52,768
*It gave me the sense anyway
that I could speak to a crowd of people

463
00:28:52,768 --> 00:28:55,211
and bring them in to what I was saying,

464
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:56,840
and have them understand.

465
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,860
And it proved incredibly valuable.

466
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:05,292
Had I gone to college, 
I would have definitely been an Architect.

467
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,953
That would have been my dream, 
to be an Architect.

468
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:10,581
<i>Nineteen fifty-four, </i>
we worked in a very small salon.

469
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:15,651
I was 26 then, and after two years,
became far too small.

470
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:18,348
It was a work-up 
on the third floor virtually.

471
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:26,334
<i>Then we moved to a much larger salon</i>
in Bond Street posh end as they say.

472
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:30,829
<i>First, we did a white salon </i>
with a black boutique.

473
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:34,954
<i>And then later, we turned the whole salon</i>
into brown,

474
00:29:34,954 --> 00:29:36,954
<i>with just steel bars in the front.</i>

475
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:39,087
<i>It looked like a hairdressing salon.</i>

476
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:41,385
<i>It looked like a modern art gallery.</i>

477
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:44,433
♪ [music] ♪

478
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:48,091
As we were changing everything,
there's change of salons as well.

479
00:29:48,091 --> 00:29:50,162
So we changed the look of the salon.

480
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:54,899
- There was his fabulous photographs on 
the wall as a collection of photographs.

481
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,156
The tables were very modern.

482
00:29:58,156 --> 00:29:59,166
Everything was modern.

483
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,153
It was open.

484
00:30:00,153 --> 00:30:02,648
You could see from the street
into the salon.

485
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:05,546
Now in those days, that was very unusual.

486
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:07,492
That people would actually be seen
getting their hair done

487
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:09,334
was a revolution.

488
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:14,394
- And people were walking around 
with a sort of a [snapping fingers] buzz.

489
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:15,776
A click.

490
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:19,595
And, it sort of created
a soar of excitement.

491
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:23,117
- And there was a mezzanine floor
with all these women standing.

492
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:24,740
Hundreds of people in there.

493
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,770
It was very difficult even to get 
to the receptionist

494
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,294
because it was just 
so many people in the shop.

495
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,084
- There was a hush in the salon.

496
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:32,625
You hear the snapping of scissors.

497
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,715
You hear -- not much chat going on.

498
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:37,542
It wasn't like a heavy-gossipy place.

499
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:39,645
It was like quite intense.

500
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:43,332
-<i>In this classy salon,</i>
boys fresh from Stretton in the suburbs,

501
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:46,540
<i>give their long-suffering customers</i>
not what they want

502
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,580
<i>but what Vidal Sassoon </i>
believes they should have.

503
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:54,816
- You're not gonna cut my hair forward,
are you?

504
00:30:54,816 --> 00:31:00,494
- [Vidal] Well, Lynda, when you came in,
I noticed that your hair was combed back.

505
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:02,359
- Yes, I like it combed back,
it's more flattering.

506
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,120
I'd rather it went back from there.

507
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,827
- Why do you want it combed back?
Give me one good reason.

508
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:07,752
- Well, it gives me height up there.

509
00:31:07,752 --> 00:31:08,894
- So, all your worrying 
about its height really.

510
00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:09,664
- Yes.

511
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:12,768
- Not the fact that it goes
back or forward but height.

512
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:13,701
- It's what I've always had 
it going back there.

513
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:15,717
- Ahh, we don't go what you've always had.

514
00:31:15,717 --> 00:31:17,875
Listen to me one moment.

515
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,861
When you came in, because your hair 
was combed back and grows forward

516
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:27,482
what you were getting here was a part,
but it was an unintentional part.

517
00:31:27,482 --> 00:31:33,492
My feeling is that if your hair
is shaped the way it grows.

518
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:37,751
Listen, [chuckling] 
if it's shaped the way it grows

519
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:40,751
and you have your height put into it

520
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:44,445
right across the hair,
you are gonna get a much more defined

521
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,645
and better shape.

522
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:47,908
You'll get all the height you need
and the shape of the head

523
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,674
will actually look better.

524
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,773
Try this way.

525
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:51,763
- Alright.

526
00:31:51,763 --> 00:31:54,412
- What I need to do is cut it in a way.

527
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,987
But if you feel you still don't like it, 
come back.

528
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:58,114
You can take it back.

529
00:31:58,114 --> 00:32:00,983
- Vidal walked into the salon
and will be working

530
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:05,468
and there will be quite a buzz going on
but, he'd walk in and suddenly

531
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:12,525
there would be a bit of a hush until 
he goes, "First client in the chair."

532
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:16,450
<i>And his assistant was there</i>
with his scissors and his combs

533
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,399
<i>and then the tempo would </i>
pick back up again

534
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:20,694
<i>as he got going.</i>

535
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:21,739
<i>Alright, he's in.</i>

536
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,597
He's settled.

537
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:24,188
He's crimping. We're in.

538
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:25,088
We're on again.

539
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,463
- [Client] Do you always insist 
on giving people what you think is right

540
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:30,118
rather than what they ask for?

541
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:33,699
- Well, the work is technical,
but on the other hand

542
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:35,782
it is instinctive as well.

543
00:32:35,782 --> 00:32:38,924
And if your instincts tell you that
what you're doing is wrong,

544
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:41,857
then you mustn't do it because
you're gonna make a bad job of it.

545
00:32:41,857 --> 00:32:44,429
I think that makes sense in anything.

546
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,519
- [Client] It takes a long time to grow 
out, surely if somebody complains

547
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,093
you're really in trouble.

548
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:54,044
- Uhmm, that's true, I mean, I think that 
people who are trying

549
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:57,776
to do something a little different
more often go out on a limb.

550
00:32:57,796 --> 00:33:00,740
If you're not trying to be safe 
all the time, on the other hand,

551
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,402
you're going to be more progressive 
and get more done.

552
00:33:03,402 --> 00:33:04,828
I think it works that way.

553
00:33:04,828 --> 00:33:09,726
- His creativity was at epic level.

554
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:13,211
It was just -- everything he did,
every section he thought

555
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:17,009
he was like a piece of art in motion.

556
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:21,332
- It's like listening to music
or you know having a great meal.

557
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,111
You know, you know, or seeing Vidal work.

558
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:30,156
<i>There was something magic about </i>
how Vidal was because he would dance.

559
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:33,892
- Most people when they cut hair, 
they cut with this comb and scissors.

560
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:36,296
Vidal cut with his whole body.

561
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:37,741
- He would move.

562
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:39,993
He would sweat, he would make faces.

563
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:42,892
He would cut hair with snip, snip, snip!

564
00:33:42,892 --> 00:33:48,291
- Vidal was in his patent leather 
slippers, with his tight trousers.

565
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,148
He was dancing around the chair.

566
00:33:50,148 --> 00:33:52,013
He was pulling faces.

567
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:55,212
- [Client] Do you have one particular 
kind of style that you put every year

568
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:59,817
or is it just anything that suits anybody?

569
00:33:59,817 --> 00:34:02,454
- Well, that's a difficult one to answer.

570
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,394
I think each year we try 
to bring out something.

571
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:07,625
We try to innovate something 
a little different.

572
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,409
- [Client] Yup, this is alright for 
somebody my age or older.

573
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,422
But what happens to someone 
20 years older?

574
00:34:12,422 --> 00:34:13,597
It can't work for everyone.

575
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:14,663
[scissors snipping]

576
00:34:14,663 --> 00:34:18,565
- The VMA's however -- every line, 
whether it be hair or clothes.

577
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:20,726
[scissors snipping]

578
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,761
A client would take something from it.

579
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,962
There is always something 
that they can take from it.

580
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,309
Even if they don't have the actual right.

581
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:33,958
- [Client] There must be an awful lot of 
turned bad from here in that case.

582
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:38,023
- Am gonna let you stew in that one
am not gonna answer it. [laughing]

583
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:41,230
- [Client] I hope you're not snipping 
too much off in revenge.

584
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,411
- Vidal made everybody nervous, 
especially me.

585
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,902
I would feel instantly sweat 
coming all over me.

586
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,074
And you know, your hands
would start shaking.

587
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:53,626
- We were told never 
to call the clients "madame."

588
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:56,183
Always to call the clients "madam."

589
00:34:56,183 --> 00:34:58,542
We were told to open the door
for the client.

590
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,548
We were told to call the taxi 
for the client.

591
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:02,500
We were told to get the lunch
for the client.

592
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:10,974
- He would not tolerate any, anything
that wasn't up to scratch.

593
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:16,965
If you did look the part, that's it, you 
just-- you went-- you're out of the door.

594
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:20,799
If you hadn't cleaned your shoes that day,
boy! you know that's it, you are out

595
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:24,007
you weren't there, 
you're just out the door.

596
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:27,309
- And there I was doing this haircut
and I'm pulling the hair out,

597
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:29,531
and I could feel him behind.

598
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:36,016
And not only do I feel him behind, but
I could hear him going snip, snip, snip.

599
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:41,262
As I was cutting he was going snip,
snip, snip. Snip, snip, snip.

600
00:35:41,262 --> 00:35:44,205
And it was freaking me out.

601
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:48,610
- I remember one time, he sent me home
because my shoes were not polished.

602
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,780
He's just you know, he was very strict.

603
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,521
Every time I assisted him, 
if I got distracted for a second

604
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,741
he would take his comb,
he would snap my hand

605
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,156
and said, "put attention."

606
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:04,853
- Well, for Vidal to check your haircut
was the end of life.

607
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:08,651
Because you knew, he was gonna find 
something wrong with it.

608
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:12,132
Because nobody could do a haircut 
to the perfection of Vidal.

609
00:36:12,132 --> 00:36:16,437
So he would pick the hair up 
[mocking Vidal].

610
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:20,047
And he'd go over this haircut, and 
he'll say, "You've gotta get it right,"

611
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:22,971
and you've gotta pull that hair. 
You've gotta put tension on the hair."

612
00:36:22,971 --> 00:36:26,596
"Move your body. Cut it again."

613
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:30,207
- But you know when -- the thing is,
you knew when he was tough

614
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:32,095
when his voice is lowered.

615
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:34,699
He has this kind of whispering thing.

616
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:39,538
And it's a, "I don't think 
you are right for here."

617
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:42,031
"You don't seem to understand it."

618
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:46,090
*So i suggest you go that way
and don't come back again."

619
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,357
But the minute that voice is lowered,
you know that was it.

up to it could be terribly frustrating.

671
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:40,375
Five-point cut for me was the epitome
of nine years of work that led up to it.

672
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:49,692
It was the last cut of geometry 
that in essence covered the whole head

673
00:39:49,692 --> 00:39:55,903
because you have to create the points, 
here, depending on bone structure

674
00:39:55,903 --> 00:40:00,477
<i>where it was on the individual character</i>
working on

675
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:04,813

of the head and the two --

676
00:40:04,813 --> 00:40:06,946
<i>so that you actually have five points.</i>

677
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:12,301
- Then I remember feeling the back and 
feeling that you know it's cut right out

678

<i>into -- into the hairline.</i>

679
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,909
<i>That was pretty revolutionary.</i>

680
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:20,842

"Stand up, okay. Shake it.

Most of my progressive thoughts
