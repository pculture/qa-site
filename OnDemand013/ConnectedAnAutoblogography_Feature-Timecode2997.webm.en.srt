"He couldn't get out of bed."

"But he wanted us all to come over

'cause he had something
really important to tell us."

And I'll never forget it, 
it was this beautiful day,

all the windows were open.

1061
01:11:58,701 --> 01:12:03,707
And we're all gathered around him, 
and my father leaned forward and said,

1062
01:12:03,707 --> 01:12:03,708
"I had a realization."

1063
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:03,708
And we all leaned and so ready
to hear what he had to say,

1064
01:12:09,774 --> 01:12:12,731
and it was that exact moment 
that he lost his ability

to speak for good.

1066
01:12:15,441 --> 01:12:20,798
And as he lay there unable to speak, 
we each got time alone with him.

1067
01:12:20,798 --> 01:12:24,054
And I remember holding 
his hand saying,

1068
01:12:24,054 --> 01:12:29,434
"Daddy you can let go, I'm gonna be okay."

On Monday morning, when Ania called
to say he passed away,

1073
01:14:01,668 --> 01:14:08,116
my first instinct was to call him
and tell him the news...

1074
01:14:13,269 --> 01:14:16,137
About two months ago, I mustered
the courage to ask him

what he wanted his funeral to be like.
