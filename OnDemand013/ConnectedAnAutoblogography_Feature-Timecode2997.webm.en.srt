<i>- [Narrator] In the beginning,</i>
the invention of the alphabet

1037
01:10:17,215 --> 01:10:22,921
<i>rewired the human brain </i>
to divide everything into isolated parts

1038
01:10:22,921 --> 01:10:27,308
<i>which helped human beings </i>
to understand the world better.

01:10:27,308 --> 01:10:35,678

<i>Today the human species </i>
is at a crossroads.

1042
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:47,448
<i>There are more humans </i>
on the planet than ever before,

1043
01:10:47,448 --> 01:10:52,164
<i>and they are more connected</i>
than ever before.

1044
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:56,405
<i>If we can harness the potential </i>
of all our minds

01:10:56,405 --> 01:10:59,707

<i>We have to.</i>

<i>The world is only going to become </i>
more and more interdependent.

1048
01:11:08,469 --> 01:11:14,991
<i>Like a beehive, every bee contributes</i>
to the survival of its colony.

1049
01:11:14,991 --> 01:11:23,201
<i>No bee can survive on its own.</i>
No human can survive on its own either.

1050
01:11:23,201 --> 01:11:28,372
<i>Our survival depends on us </i>
connecting to one another.

1051
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:31,219
<i>But connecting broadly </i>
is meaningless

01:11:31,219 --> 01:11:36,799

The treatment stopped working.

"He couldn't get out of bed."

"But he wanted us all to come over

'cause he had something
really important to tell us."

it was this beautiful day,

all the windows were open.

1061
01:11:58,701 --> 01:12:03,707
And we're all gathered around him, 
and my father leaned forward and said,

1062
01:12:03,707 --> 01:12:03,708
"I had a realization."

1063
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:03,708
And we all leaned and so ready
to hear what he had to say,

1064
01:12:09,774 --> 01:12:12,731
and it was that exact moment 
that he lost his ability

to speak for good.

1066
01:12:15,441 --> 01:12:20,798
And as he lay there unable to speak, 
we each got time alone with him.

1067
01:12:20,798 --> 01:12:24,054
And I remember holding 
his hand saying,

1068
01:12:24,054 --> 01:12:29,434
"Daddy you can let go, I'm gonna be okay."

1069

my first instinct was to call him
