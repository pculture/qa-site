of a drug to treat AIDS.

305
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,854
The drug, AZT, is not a cure for the disease,

*Half the people who take AZT
can't take it because of side effects. *

*Therefore, the FDA has to take a more
activists' stance in the experimental process.*

387
00:25:49,872 --> 00:25:53,988
And only the FDA has the power
under existing laws and regulations

AIDS virus and I am sorry.

420
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:53,084
but don't you think that the
Federal Drug Administration

421
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:59,337
has a responsibility not to let people,
such as you, have quack

422
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:04,454
that could cause even more harm
than you already have?

423
00:29:04,454 --> 00:29:09,157
- The problem is, is that
the FDA is using the same process to test

424
00:29:09,157 --> 00:29:14,714
a nasal spray at it is to test AIDS drugs,
and it's a seven to ten-year process.

425
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:20,745
- You have the FDA giving you a drug.
So far, you've got AZT. Why would--

426
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:23,387
- Which I can't take because it's far too toxic.
- But there--

427

- Remember, over half the people that
have HIV can't take it.

is nothing else that is worth anything.

but I agree with you a hundred percent.

430
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,609
I think if someone's got AIDS and someone
wants to take a drug, it's their life,

431
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:42,097

you ought to be able to take it.

What I wanna ask you is whether you know
of anything that you think might be

433
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:50,329
some kind of miraculous cure that you think
they're sitting on at FDA?

434
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:56,412
- There are over 140 drugs out there that
the FDA has identified as possibilities,

00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:59,344
and are in some stage are
being looked up right now.

436
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:02,718

- Among that 140, there's gotta be one

437
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:08,609
or combination thereof that can slow down
this virus or halt it in its tracks.

438
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:11,344
- You're just simply carrying the virus,
is that correct?

and my immune system is virtually shot.

I'm taking it on the underground right now.

about Dextran Sulfate, and neither do you--

444
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,416
- Well, I'll tell you this,
it's an over-the-counter drug in Japan

445
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:33,021
and has been for 20 years, over-the-counter.

00:30:33,021 --> 00:30:33,534
- Yes.

447

- *[Pat] Mr. Staley--*

448
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,795
- I'm only asking that they be released after--

449
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:42,221
after there's a minimal amount of efficacy,
not a 100% test.

00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:46,062
- *[Pat] --get something here. *
You've got the pink triangle on your shirt,

451
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:48,306
I gather that means you're a homosexual.

452
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,057
- Yes.

453
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,887
- *Looking in the camera,*
what would you tell some kids,

454
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:53,137
say, you had a younger brother,
twenty-one years old,

455
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:56,249
who also might have homosexual tendencies,

456
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:58,830
what would you tell him if you want him
to live a long life?

457
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,146
- Use a condom, and also to use
a lubricant, by the way,

458
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:06,357
that has the medicine--
- [Pat] And actually this is *Russian roulette.*

459
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:09,889
- It is not Russian roulette.
It is Russian roulette to not give people

460
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:14,130
this information when human nature
dictates that they're gonna go out there

461
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,137
and they're gonna have sex anywhere. 
- You mean celibacy is impossible?

462
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:18,329
- It's not just gonna work.
People aren’t gonna do it

463
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:20,305
and lots of people are gonna die.

464
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:24,699
Now, would you rather have a lot of people
cheating under the celibacy

465
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:27,892
with thousands of people dying
or would you rather save those lives?

466
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:29,715
and let them have sex.

467
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:31,568

00:39:55,004 --> 00:39:59,876
*First, the viral RNA needs
to transform itself into a DNA copy,*

595
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:05,320
*in order to knit itself into
the nuclear DNA of the newly infected cell.*

596
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,192
*This occurs via process called,*
reversed transcription.

597
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:15,088
*AZT and DDI were both
originally developed to try to inhibit*

598
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:18,313
*that process of establishing infection.*

599
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:21,869
*A number of other researchers
began to focus on another portion*

600
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,804
*of the viral life cycle,
after the cell is already infected.*

601
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:31,506
One of the steps that it takes is that
it makes a viral protein.

602
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:36,187
It has to snip that viral protein
in very specific places.

603
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:41,920
*The resulting pieces self-assemble
to make the viral particle.*

604
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,782
*And what does the snipping
and what in fact controls the snipping,*

605
00:40:45,782 --> 00:40:48,848
*is a viral protein called,
the protease.*

606
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:53,089
*If you genetically modified the viral protease,
so that it can no longer snip--*

607
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:56,764
*The virus no longer has the ability
to make those component pieces*

608
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:58,696
*that it need to make in order
to self-assemble*

609
00:40:58,696 --> 00:41:01,605
*and make an infectious viral particle.*

of HIV protease

611
00:41:05,206 --> 00:41:08,924

612

a few weeks, it was in the literature.

613
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,276

"Alright, can we prove it?

Can we prove it that that is in fact the case?

615
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,996
And most importantly, can we prove that

616
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:24,703
if you inhibit that protease,
if you knock out its activity,

617
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:29,192
that the virus can no longer replicate,
and therefore make new progeny

618
00:41:29,192 --> 00:41:31,563
viral particles that would
then go on and establish

619

was even bleaker than the mood before.

788
00:51:56,874 --> 00:52:01,830
Because we had no indication that they
were gonna change or respond to our demands.

789
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:05,391
And we had in fact had a meeting with them
in Bethesda, after the NIH action.

790
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:08,351
That indicated that there was
total resistance to putting people

791
00:52:08,351 --> 00:52:10,495
from the community on the research committees,

792
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:12,544
to let in the ACT UP observers attend the meetings,

793

and to open up the meetings 
so that they weren't secret anymore.

794
00:52:15,395 --> 00:52:17,518
So why should Science
be shrowded in secrecy?

It's supposed to be based on
a free exchange of ideas.

And so, it was very important

scientist and people working on AIDS,

Why the U.S. systems wasn’t working out.

799
00:52:32,812 --> 00:52:38,225

reached symbolically through the NIH action.

Will we realize that we share
similar motivations.

During the upcoming days,

our AIDS treatment agenda,
which includes a list of 99 drugs

However, from your side,
we are being constantly told to butt out.

818
00:54:06,671 --> 00:54:11,940
On my side, the level of anger
and frustration is reaching such a point

819
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,730
that attitudes claiming that all of you are
uncaring and in it for greed

*are now widespread.*

All we do is pick at each other,

01:11:19,832 --> 01:11:24,418
and yell at each other!
And I say to you, in year 10,

1066
01:11:24,818 --> 01:11:31,931

open, but it's silly to risk arrest

with other measures.

a critique of all the NIH's AIDS programs.

1086
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:05,919
- The research is spread out over
12 agencies. There's no coordination.

1087
01:13:05,919 --> 01:13:09,254
There's a lot of duplications.
There's no leadership.

1088
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:11,843
- The budget is shrinking and shrinking
as cases mount

1089
01:13:11,843 --> 01:13:14,819
and the President needs to be blamed
as well as the Congress.

Who cut the entire NIH budget
by 150 million two weeks ago.

1091
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:21,892
- Our recommendations, I think,
are gonna require some legislation

1092
01:13:21,892 --> 01:13:25,608
and so we have to go to our friends on the hill

1093

looked like it may have had the potency

1096

and the physical properties that we wanted,
and it could be a possible drug.

see very substantial drop in virus load. *

1102
01:14:02,501 --> 01:14:05,501
So that was the first week. 
The second week was very disappointing.

1103
01:14:05,501 --> 01:14:08,346
Because what we saw
in the second week was in fact,

1104
01:14:08,346 --> 01:14:11,303
virus load coming right back up again.

1105

One exception...

1106
01:14:12,603 --> 01:14:18,909
- There was one patient that--
patient #143, I believe, was his number,

1107
01:14:19,202 --> 01:14:22,093
that the virus went down
and stayed down.

1108
01:14:22,093 --> 01:14:24,272
- That told us that it was possible.

1109

If it can happen in one, then by definition,
it can happen in everyone.

You just need to figure out

and in a completely different state of mind.

1113

"Okay, now what do we need to do
in order to make it possible?"

1184
01:19:51,423 --> 01:19:54,831
*and I felt like doing something like this
is a way of showing, *

1185
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:57,363
there's nothing beautiful about it.
You know, this is what I'm left with.

1186
01:19:57,363 --> 01:19:59,597
I've got a box full of ashes
and bone chips.

1187
01:19:59,732 --> 01:20:02,292
You know, there's new beauty in that.

1188
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:05,228
And I felt like a statement like this
is like saying,

1189
01:20:05,228 --> 01:20:07,431
"This is what George Bush has done".

1190
01:20:07,431 --> 01:20:09,935
"This is what him and Ronald Reagan
before him have done."

1200
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,661
for president of the United States,

1202

- Mr. President, yesterday,
tens of thousands of people

1203
01:23:09,077 --> 01:23:14,920
paraded pass the White House to demonstrate
their concern about the disease AIDS.

1204
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,590
A celebrated member of your Commission,
Magic Johnson,

1205
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:22,723
quipped saying 
that there was too much inaction.

1206
01:23:22,723 --> 01:23:26,703
*Where is this widespread feeling
coming from that your administration *

1207
01:23:26,703 --> 01:23:28,671
is not doing enough about AIDS?

1208
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:33,351
I can't tell you where it's coming from,
but I am very much concerned about AIDS.

1209
01:23:33,351 --> 01:23:36,992
And I believe that we've got the
best researchers in the world

1210
01:23:36,992 --> 01:23:39,457
out there at NIH working the problem.

1211
01:23:39,457 --> 01:23:42,679
*It's one of the few disease
where behavior matters. *

1212
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:45,624
And I once called on somebody, well,
change your behavior,

1213
01:23:45,624 --> 01:23:50,512
if the behavior, you're using prone to cause AIDS,
change the behavior.

1214
01:23:50,512 --> 01:23:54,176
The next thing I know, one of these
ACT UP group is out saying,

1215
01:23:54,176 --> 01:23:58,034
*"Bush ought to change his behav..."
You can't talk about it rationally. *

1216
01:24:17,213 --> 01:24:28,042
- *[Robert] Let everyone here know that this is not
a political funeral for Mark Fischer, *

1217
01:24:28,042 --> 01:24:37,732
*who wouldn’t let us burn or bury
his courage or his love for us*

1218
01:24:37,732 --> 01:24:40,846
*any more than he would like the earth
take his body, *

01:24:40,846 --> 01:24:44,252
*until it was already in flight.*

1220
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:49,368

not so we could bury him, *

1221
01:24:49,368 --> 01:24:53,853
*but so we could celebrate
his undying anger. *

1222

*This isn't a political funeral
for Mark. *

1223
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:02,824
It's a political funeral
for the man who killed him,

1224
01:25:03,163 --> 01:25:08,035
and so many others
and is slowly killing me,

1225
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:13,220
whose name curls my tongue,
and curddles my breath,

1226
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:18,663
George Bush, we believe
you'll be defeated tomorrow,

1227
01:25:18,663 --> 01:25:22,739
because we believe there's still
some justice left in the universe,

1228
01:25:22,739 --> 01:25:27,264
and some compassion left
in the American people.

1229
01:25:27,981 --> 01:25:34,405
For whether or not you are here now
standing by Mark's body,

1230
01:25:34,405 --> 01:25:40,236
we put this curse on you.
Mark's spirit will haunt you

1231
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:43,046
until the end of your days,

1232
01:25:43,046 --> 01:25:48,840
so that in the moment of your defeat,
you'll remember our defeats.

1233
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:53,270
And in the moment of your death,
you'll remember our deaths.

1234
01:25:55,821 --> 01:26:03,337
As for Mark, when the living can no
longer speak, the dead may speak for them.

1235
01:26:04,423 --> 01:26:10,384
*Mark's voice is here with us,
as is the voice of Pericles,*

1236
01:26:10,789 --> 01:26:16,770
who two millenniums ago, mourned 
the Athenian soldiers who didn't have to die

1237
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:19,794
and in whose death he was complicit.

1238
01:26:20,273 --> 01:26:26,452
But who had an ability to say
that their memorial was the whole earth.

1239
01:26:27,036 --> 01:26:34,525
Let the whole earth hear us now.
We beg, we pray, we demand!

1240
01:26:34,779 --> 01:26:38,335
That this epidemic end!

1241
01:26:38,434 --> 01:26:47,814
Not just so we may live, but so that
Mark's soul may rest in peace at last.

1242
01:26:53,651 --> 01:26:59,725
And in anger and in grief,
this fight is not over until all of us is safe.

1243
01:27:07,629 --> 01:27:11,831
ACT UP, fight back, fight AIDS.

that challenges

the effectiveness of AZT, the widely
prescribed drug used to treat the HIV virus.

- *[Larry] This study just proves
what every other study proves *

mostly useless,

in AIDS treatment over the last five years

a waste of money for the U.S. tax payer,

and it was naivete on our part to think
that the magic bullet was out there,

Dr. Kessler, how excited should we get
about this new family of drugs,

1284
01:31:23,539 --> 01:31:25,408
these protease inhibitors?

1285
01:31:25,408 --> 01:31:29,497
- I don't wanna over-promise,
but these are the most potent drugs

1286
01:31:29,497 --> 01:31:32,287
we've seen against the virus.

1287
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:36,178
- I know that you are pushing
for faster FDA approval of these drugs,

1288
01:31:36,178 --> 01:31:39,310
I know that the application has just gone
for the first of these drugs to the FDA,

1289
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:40,594
it's still gonna take six months.

1290
01:31:40,594 --> 01:31:44,789
- We will turn around that application
as quick as ever.

1291
01:31:44,789 --> 01:31:47,725
We are proving drugs
in a matter of months these days.

1292
01:31:47,725 --> 01:31:51,129
- But you were telling me, that's six months,
right? That's as quick as possible.

1293
01:31:51,129 --> 01:31:53,273
- We may be able to do it
even a little quicker.

1294
01:31:53,273 --> 01:31:56,659
- *[newsman] A split has developed between 
those who want rapid approval *

1295
01:31:56,659 --> 01:32:01,390
*based on early indicators of success,
and the Treatment Action Group, or TAG.*

1296
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:05,868
*TAG has asked the FDA to reconsider
the accelerated approval process. *

*"No, the company has asked you
to approve that drug too soon.*

*They need a little bit more data first.*

1300
01:32:14,047 --> 01:32:18,011
- *[newsman] TAG is asking the FDA 
to take a closer look at Saquinavir, *

1301
01:32:18,011 --> 01:32:21,215
*the first protease inhibitor
to seek approval. *

1302
01:32:21,215 --> 01:32:25,176
- *We need to make sure we don't repeat
the mistake we made with AZT and DDI.*

1303
01:32:25,176 --> 01:32:28,450
*This is a new class of drugs.
We need to know if it works. *

1304
01:32:29,726 --> 01:32:35,256
- *The battle over early approval
of Saquinavir was a really pivotal moment*

1305
01:32:35,256 --> 01:32:40,964
*for treatment activism and we took
such shit for it from within.*

1306
01:32:40,964 --> 01:32:43,787
- There are a lot of people who do agree
that there are problems,

1307
01:32:43,787 --> 01:32:47,465
series of problems the way drug testing
and drug trials are run.

1308
01:32:47,465 --> 01:32:50,446
But there are many of us who feel that
halting--

1309
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:55,585
accelerated approval is not necessarily
the answer.

1310
01:32:55,585 --> 01:32:58,355
- *[Bill] Tenet made their proposal
for this large simple trial *

1311
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:03,419
of 18,000 people that they wanna put
in a placebo-controlled trial,

1312
01:33:03,419 --> 01:33:05,881
where one-third will get placebo.

1313
01:33:05,881 --> 01:33:09,297
They pushed this idea on the FDA
at a secret meeting,

1314
01:33:09,297 --> 01:33:11,453
which was not announced to the community.

1315
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:14,474
*This is something we have fought
hard and long for. *

1316
01:33:14,474 --> 01:33:18,230
We've been arrested to get
accelerated approval through.

1317
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:20,253
- It's the behavior that
I have a problem with.

1318
01:33:20,253 --> 01:33:23,113
It's the work they're doing
that I have a problem with,

1319
01:33:23,113 --> 01:33:27,692
and this is what I am gonna fight.
I'm not interested in mud wrestling with the boys.

1320
01:33:27,692 --> 01:33:31,819
I am absolutely enraged that there are people
who have appointed themselves

1321
01:33:31,819 --> 01:33:36,621
a elitist representatives, and represent
themselves as a single voice of this epidemic.

1322
01:33:36,621 --> 01:33:39,223
I am gonna fight them.
My patients are gonna fight them.

1323
01:33:39,223 --> 01:33:42,235
And you God damn will go fight them!

1324
01:33:48,197 --> 01:33:50,615
- Currently, there's this big discussion
on accelerated approval

and <u></u> last week on the floor.<u></u>_<u>_</u>

1326
01:33:53,388 --> 01:33:56,857
So we just wanted to give you
sort of the TAG perspective

1327
01:33:56,857 --> 01:33:59,775
and give you a sense of our proposal
around pre-AIDS drug development

1328
01:33:59,775 --> 01:34:03,350
so we can start from a baseline 
common understanding and knowledge.

1329
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:06,542
this proposal is not about taking
expanded access away,

1330
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:09,793
taking accelerated approval away.
This is about adding something.

1331
01:34:09,793 --> 01:34:14,012
This is about figuring out how do we get
information about how to actually use these drugs.

1332
01:34:14,012 --> 01:34:17,402
We need more people when you have
a less powerful drug.

1333
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:21,084
If we give them the penicillin
we could do it to 20 people.

1334
01:34:21,084 --> 01:34:24,022
So we put together a large
simple trial that tried to synthesize

1335
01:34:24,022 --> 01:34:26,695
expanded access in large simple trial.

1336
01:34:26,695 --> 01:34:31,458
And what we did is we presented it to Merck.
We presented it to the FDA.

1337
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:34,309
We wanted to start a community discussion.

1338

ACT UP is talking about making drug available.

1346
01:34:55,692 --> 01:34:57,185
There should be a way to mesh those two.

1347

I had a future, now I do,
