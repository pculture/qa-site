      <p begin="01:25:35.259" end="01:25:37.291">we'll take back <br/>but the fact is that the balance</p>
      <p begin="01:25:37.291" end="01:25:39.624">will be that we're just<br/>gonna be substantially</p>

      <p begin="01:25:42.850" end="01:25:47.267">and without adversely <br/>affecting our happiness.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:47.267" end="01:25:50.253">The fact of the matter is that <br/>if only I change<br/></p>
      <p begin="01:25:50.253" end="01:25:51.965">it's not gonna make a difference.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:51.965" end="01:25:56.052">But, the hope is that if each of us <br/>as individuals change, </p>
      <p begin="01:25:56.052" end="01:25:59.149">it's going to inspire everybody to change.</p>
      <p begin="01:25:59.149" end="01:26:03.819">So, I believe the most radical, <br/>political act there is, is to be an optimist.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:03.819" end="01:26:06.732">The most radical, political act there is, <br/>is to believe that if I change,</p>
      <p begin="01:26:06.732" end="01:26:08.262"> other people will follow suit.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:08.262" end="01:26:13.146">The reason why I am here is <br/>because a first grader called Olive,</p>
      <p begin="01:26:13.146" end="01:26:16.950">wrote to me on my blog <br/>and asked me if I would come.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:16.950" end="01:26:20.625">People ask me, if I could just <br/>do one thing, what should it be?</p>
      <p begin="01:26:20.625" end="01:26:24.140">Not use plastic bags <br/>or not use plastic cups,</p>
      <p begin="01:26:24.940" end="01:26:27.985">I would say, if there was <br/>only one thing to do</p>
      <p begin="01:26:27.985" end="01:26:31.034">it would be to volunteer with<br/>an environmental organization.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:31.034" end="01:26:33.949">Part of the reason for that<br/>is because there is community.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:33.949" end="01:26:38.565">I believe very strongly that a lot of the<br/>environmental problems in our planet</p>
      <p begin="01:26:38.565" end="01:26:41.074">have come because of the <br/>breakdown of community.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:41.074" end="01:26:42.160">Because without community, <br/></p>
      <p begin="01:26:42.160" end="01:26:44.824">none of us feel accountable <br/>to anybody else.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:44.824" end="01:26:46.526">All of us are interconnected</p>
      <p begin="01:26:46.526" end="01:26:47.498">and on many levels.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:47.498" end="01:26:49.466">You know, if you're religious<br/></p>
      <p begin="01:26:49.466" end="01:26:51.641">then you understand <br/>that at a religious level.</p>
      <p begin="01:26:51.641" end="01:26:55.457">But even if you're just practical, <br/>you can see<br/></p>

      <p begin="01:26:57.084" end="01:27:00.039">If I, you know, splash a puddle <br/>and you're standing next to it, </p>
