telling me that being strong, smart,
and accomplished was not enough.

To be a woman meant constantly striving

I had a lot of problems 
with the network

telling me that I was too fat.

It's a hugely profitable pursuit

A national problem.*

the more likely they are to be 
depressed, to have eating disorders.

Women who are high self-objectifiers

Political efficacy is the idea that

00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:19,830
in every state and community
of this country.

296
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,838
The living wage campaigns,
Micro-Enterprise, safety,

297
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:26,118
everything that needed different thinking,
women have been doing it,

298
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,189
so we gotta get them
in the tables of power.

299
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:31,108
- [Condoleezza Rice] Well, two things 
have to happen when you talk about

300
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:34,687
women moving to the next rung
or minorities moving to the next rung.

301
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,999
First, we have to have the candidates.

302
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:39,248
You have to have people
who are in the pools

303
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:41,196
from which these positions are drawn.

304
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:44,286
But you also have to have a kind 
of psychological breakthrough

305
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:51,386
or can an American see a woman
born African-American in that position?

306
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:55,349
Now I think with women,
we still have a bit to go.

307
00:18:57,684 --> 00:19:00,784
- [Jennifer] I knew these obstacles 
still existed from my generation,

308
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,617
*but I wanted to find out 
if things were any better*

309
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,933
for young women
seeking leadership positions.

310
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:10,403
So I spent time with an exceptional 
young woman named, Devanshi Patel,

311
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,456
who aspires to have 
a career in public service.

312
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:15,790
- [Devanshi Patel]
"Well, welcome to Bill Hearing.

313
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,886
Tonight is the bill hearing night for

314
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:21,280
The Central Silicon Valley YMCA 
Youth and Government Delegation."

315
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:25,517
So, first time I ran for public office 
was in 4th grade.

316
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,513
My parents award with me.
We made all these flyers

317
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:32,306
with all these cute little slogans
and we campaigned all over the school,

318
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:36,397
and I was actually the runner-up 
by a handful of votes.

319
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,377
I think everyone is born with something

320
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,832
that they have to do 
and for me, this was it.

321
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:43,585
Every time that I could run for something,
I didn't run for anything less.

322
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:46,125
I didn't run for Vice President 
or Treasurer. I ran for President.

323
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:48,870
- *[Ranna Patel] I asked her one day. 
I think it was in 5th grade.*

324
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,441
*I said, "Devanshi, you always want
to be a leader,*

325
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,437
*but do you know what a leader is?"*

326
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,598
She says, "It's very simple, Mama.
They are just servants to people.

327
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:00,134
Leaders are just servants to people."

328
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:03,423
- [Devanshi] I loved the Youth 
and Government program.

329
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:06,991
The best way I can give back
is by running for Youth Governor.

330
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,123
- [speaker] How would you solve 
the California Budget Crisis?

331
00:20:10,123 --> 00:20:11,282
Starting with Ms. Patel.

332
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:13,248
- [Devanshi] I would cut 
unnecessary spending.

333
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,826
Well, when I was running for office, 
there were a lot of--

334
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:19,770
if not outward shows of sexism,
little remarks here and there, like

335
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:21,678
you know, "Oh, she speaks well 
for a woman.

336
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,553
She's smart for a woman."

337
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:26,215
There were also a couple instances
with some of my friends

338
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:29,237
*when they were going to speak 
in front of a large audience*

339
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:32,080
*and the only thing people could
focus on was their body, *

340
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,443
*what they looked like,
what they were wearing.*

341
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,748
I thought, you know, 
"We're better than this."

342
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:43,227
$$ Devanshi lost the election to one of 
her male opponents, coming in second.

343
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:49,811
- [Ranna Patel] She said,"Mama,
looks like I'm another Hilary Clinton."

344
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,280
- [Oliver Mittelstaedt] 
Guys will vote for guys.

345
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,136
And girls would vote for guys,
but some other time,

346
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:56,261
girls have a harder time getting
the girls do vote girls because

347
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,796
I feel like, girls are 
kinda harder on other girls.

348

in California's YMCA

350
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:10,067
*- [Jennifer] Devanshi's story made me 
think about how early *

351
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,404
*girls face a deep gender bias.*

352
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:15,918
*And how things have not changed
as much as we'd like to think.*

353
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,328
- [Gavin Newsom] One of the first things
I did when I became Mayor of San Francisco

354
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:23,972
is I appointed a female police chief
and then a female fire chief.

355
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,519
When they both show up at the podium,
in a disaster, a lot of national media

356
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,785
would look there and say,
"Well, where is the police chief?"

357
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,239
"She's right here."

358
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,904
"And where's the fire chief?"
"Well, she's right here."

359
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:36,770
People thought I was trying 
to make some grand statement,

360
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,584
when in fact, I was actually just hiring 
the most qualified two candidates.

361
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:46,111
The incredible opposition
was coming mostly from women.

362
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:49,523
And those that feel it's much
too soon, too fast,

363
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:52,343
they never would've question 
at how they've been men.

364
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:54,720
- [Caroline Heldman]
Little boys and little girls

365
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,802
when they're seven years old,

366
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:58,467
an equal number want to be
President of the United States

367
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,287
when they grow up, about 30%.

368
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:03,550
*But then, you ask the same
question when they're 15*

369
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,482
*and you see this massive gap emerging.*

370
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:07,575
*So, we have this gendered socialization,*

371
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,678
*where politics is considered
to be for men.*

372

*Leadership is considered to be
a masculine pursuit*

from pursuing ambitious positions.

375
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,249
- [Carol Jenkins] I think what happens is
that if you do not have women there,

376
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:32,074
then girls do not see
that they can be that.

377
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:37,199
So, it's really what you see 
that inspires your idea of

378
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,130
what's possible for you in the world.

379
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:41,693
- [Krystal Ball] "I do disagree
with Sarah Palin on a lot of issues,

380
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,879
but seeing her up on stage there
with her young family

381
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:47,503
and her young baby was just beautiful.

382
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:50,126

Maybe I could give this a shot as well.'"

383
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:55,821
$$ 68% of viewers were more likely
to accept a female president

384
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:59,782
- [Marie Wilson] Having this opportunity 
to see women, to see women leadership,

385
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,735
to see women's leadership in reality
and on the screen

386
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:06,095
and on the television, 
is huge for women. Huge.

387
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:09,604
Because you don't have that 
many women really in leadership.

388
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:12,309
So the way that it gets done
to a certain extent

389
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,723
and way problems get solved 
often have to do with Hollywood.

390
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:19,138
And the films that get made. 
The documentaries, the television shows,

391
00:23:19,177 --> 00:23:23,118
start where people are
and people are watching television.

392
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:27,806
- *[Jennifer] There are some examples
of films and TV shows*

$$ CANCELLED AFTER ONE SEASON

396
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:41,249
I decided to pursue acting
professionally at the age of 28.

397
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:44,146
And was hopeful I could find
complex roles to play.

398
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:48,368
My first reality check came when 
my agent told me to lie about my age

00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:51,691
and remove my Stanford MBA 
from my resume

400

Well, I didn't do either.

402

But my confidence was really shaken.

multi-dimensional roles
to even audition for.

443

*trying to get love, get married 
and get pregnant.*

444

447
00:26:18,585 --> 00:26:21,947
- [Geena Davis] Between 1937 and 2005,

448
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:26,969
there were only 13 female protagonists
in animated movies.

449
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:32,075
All of them, except one,
had the aspiration of finding romance.

450
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,309
- [Lisa Ling] As a culture, women are
brought up to just be kind of

451
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:38,229
fundamentally insecure 
and always looking for the time

452
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:44,400

and rescue us or provide for us.

453
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:48,069
*- [Caroline Heldman] When it comes to
female leaders in entertainment media,*

454
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:52,599
*we see the bitchy boss who 
has sacrificed family and love *

455
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,386

456

- "I said to myself, 'Take a chance. 
*Hire the smart, fat girl."*

457
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,706
- The whole movie is about 
bringing her down a peg

458
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:07,013
and this is generally done by someone
who is under her, a subordinate,

459
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:10,507
typically a male, so that image 
doesn't bode well,

460
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:14,038
when it comes to ideas 
of women in leadership.

461
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:17,502
- *[Paul Haggis] We had many more
interesting characters on screen*

462
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,264
in the 20s, 30s, 40s
than we do now.

463
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:24,454
And we allowed women to really
embody all the conrtadictions

464
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:26,298
*that make up a human being
back then.*

465
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:28,922
*They could be the* femme fatale

466
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:31,860
*and then turn around 
and be the mother.*

467
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,378
*And then turn around 
and be the seductress.*

468
00:27:34,378 --> 00:27:37,900
And then turn and be the saint.
And we accepted that.

469
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:40,632
They were complex human beings.

470
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:43,393
Now we really like to put people in boxes.

471
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:46,380
- "The only two choices for women: 
Witch and Sexy Kitten."

472
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,520
- "Oh, you just said 
a mouthful there, sister."

473
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,212
- *As men, we do it because
we don't understand characters *

474
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,073
*that aren't ourselves and we are yet
willing to put ourselves*

475
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:59,183
in the skin of those characters
and women, I think, terrify us.

476
00:27:59,771 --> 00:28:01,773
*We tend not to write women 
as human beings.*

477
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,689
*It's cartoons we're making now.*

478
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:05,274
And that's a shame.

479
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:09,242
- *[Caroline Heldman] Throughout any type 
of mass media there is,*

480
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:13,270
we see the widespread acceptance
of women as sex objects.

481
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,712
*In rock videos, rapping, hip hop videos.
in all the summer blockbusters,*

482
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:22,071
women are basically just body props there
for young male viewers.

483
00:28:22,747 --> 00:28:24,938
- [Joshua] I think when they 
do put in the part,

484
00:28:24,938 --> 00:28:29,866
she's used as a sexual object or the
object of desire a lot toward the men,

485
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,354
which I think should change a lot

486
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:34,664
because there's still a lot more 
to women than just a body.

495
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:53,723
that's not genetically predestined.
That's learned behavior.

496
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:56,486
- "You don't think I can be a surgeon?

I had just gotten a series

00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:19,148
- "You motherfucking whore!"

588
00:34:19,502 --> 00:34:23,539
- *This notion that women 
are natural enemies vying for *

589
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:28,492
*the prize of being more beautiful
than the rest or the love of whoever,*

590
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,953
is so counter to women in real life.

591
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:36,305
- *"Please, pick me, pick me, pick me. 
See how beautiful I am."*

592
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,603
*- [M. Gigi Durham] There's a really 
unequal power relationship going on there,*

593
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:41,904
*where it's the girls whose bodies 
are on display and the boys *

594
00:34:41,904 --> 00:34:43,521
*get the power to arbitrate and judge,*

595
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:45,809
whether their bodies
are acceptable or not acceptable,

596
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:47,377
*desirable or not desirable. *

597
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,849
So, I think there's 
a whole lot going on there

598
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,583
that actually puts girls in 
a really disempowered position.

599
00:34:52,996 --> 00:34:55,792
- *[Jennifer Pozner] These shows over
the course of the last decade, *

600
00:34:55,792 --> 00:35:00,097
have tried to portray a world in which, 
the only options available to women

601
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:04,081
mimic the 1950s model of femininity, 
in which women's only power

602
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:07,297
was her beauty, in which women
not only had no choices,

603
00:35:07,297 --> 00:35:11,153
*but shouldn't have even wanted any, 
in which men wore burdens *

604
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:13,585
*with the responsibility of being
the prince charming, *

605
00:35:13,585 --> 00:35:17,132
*who comes in and whisks women away 
to happily ever after.*

606
00:35:17,176 --> 00:35:19,628
*Then has to provide for their 
financial security.*

607
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:25,181
Nobody wins in this model, but
women particularly, lose in this model,

608
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:28,371
where they're expected to look
like Miss USA, have sex

609
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:31,161
like Samantha on *Sex and the City*
and think like June Cleaver.

610
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:39,540
- *[Jennifer] And here's something I find 
even more disheartening.*

611
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:41,490
*Watching the news.*

612
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:45,866
*So many female journalists
are objectified or sexualized.*

613
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:53,659
- *♪ [CBS theme music ] ♪ This is the CBS
Evening News with Katie Couric.*

614
00:35:56,158 --> 00:35:58,914
- "Hi, everyone. I'm very happy
to be with you tonight."

615
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:02,578
*- [Carol Jenkins] Katie Couric was 
the very first national experience *

616
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:07,026
we had all together viewing.
The woman who was not entertaining us,

617
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,234
*but whose presence and presentation*

618
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,827
*was vital for anything information 
that we needed.*

619
00:36:11,858 --> 00:36:14,670
- [Katie Couric] The three major
evening newscasts had been

620
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,694
dominated by white males.

621
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:19,162
*They had very similar faces *

622
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:22,054
*and very similar backgrounds
for the most part.*

623
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:25,356
I thought this is an opportunity 
to mix it up a little bit.

624
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:28,732
I also thought it was an important message
that a woman could be as confident

625
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:32,843
as a man in an important powerful role.

626
00:36:33,054 --> 00:36:34,266
- [Carol Jenkins] And I remember 
in the early days,

627
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:36,330
when I would get calls 
from reporters about,

628
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,950
"Ah! That we have our
first woman anchor.

629
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,293
What do you think about that?"

630
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:43,078
Inevitably, the questions 
that they would ask first, were,

631
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,335
*"What about those legs?"*

632
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,286
*"Do you think she was 
showing too much leg?", or*

633
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:49,553
"What about that winter white, 
wasn't that a big mistake?"

634
00:36:49,553 --> 00:36:53,125
*They were all observations
that had to do with her physicality *

635
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,108
and not really about the content at all.

636
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:57,606
But again it's because 
as I've always said,

637
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,999
"We are a nation of teenage boys."

638
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:03,275
We don't know, you know, 
what to make of this woman

639
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:06,799
sitting in front of us and so you know,
we look at her legs, her boobs,

640
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:10,599
her hair, her whatever, you know.
Then maybe way down the line,

641
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:14,011
we'll get to listen to what she's saying.

642
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:15,968
- [Rachel Maddow] Ever since
I've been in media at all,

643
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:18,624
even since, you know, 
the first morning show that I was on

644
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:22,367
in Holyoke, Massachusetts, you know,
I was this sidekick newsgirl.

645
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,510
There's been like 
a really consistent proportion of--

646
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,256
I don't even know if I call it criticism.
Essentially, it's hate mail.

647
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:34,026
As I've become sort of better known
and I get more feedback,

648
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:37,211
the amount of 
"I hate you, homophobic.

649
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,499
I hate what you look like.
I'm gonna kill you."

650
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:45,835
Like threatening mail stuff, 
it's like the proportions

651
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,164
has stayed exactly the same.

652
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:52,311
It's always 14% of the feedback
and it's almost all of the hate mail

653
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:56,981
is about gender and sexuality.
I mean, who has the time

654
00:37:56,981 --> 00:37:59,677
if that's really what you think
and you really are that bad a speller,

655
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,654
like you really, you're still gonna 
take this time to let me know

656
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:06,737
what you 'thunk' about--
[laughs] about what I look like?

657
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:13,010
- [Lisa Ling] It's the scrutinization 
that women get

658
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:17,447
that far surpasses 
the scrutinization that men get.

659
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:22,719
I don't ever see gossip columns 
or tabloids reporting

660
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:27,222
on Brian Williams' personal life, 
yet Katie Couric

661
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:32,718
and what she is wearing
or who she's dating is headline news.

662
00:38:33,493 --> 00:38:36,158
- [Katie Couric] I think whenever there
are two women who are working

663
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:41,818
in similar professions, it's
automatically positioned as a cat fight.

664
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:45,350
Diane Sawyer and I were pitted
against each other as if, you know,

665
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,545
we were gonna be in a mud wrestling
competition on the weekends.

666
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:52,912
And you never saw that with say, 
Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings.

667
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:55,710
- "Take it away with the red hot boys
in blue, which--"

668
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,948
- "I got this one down."

669
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:57,362
- "Okay, good."

670
00:38:57,395 --> 00:39:00,090
- Sometimes I look on 
the cable news channels.

671
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:05,226
I see women wearing very low cut shirts
and lots of makeup

672
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:09,322
and you know, their hair is kind of
tussled and they look like

673
00:39:09,322 --> 00:39:13,006
they're working as cocktail waitresses,
instead of newscasters.

674
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:16,400
It's just a very mixed message.

675
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:17,981
- [Jay Leno] "Folks, we're gonna 
play a game.

676
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,513
I'm gonna show you
a photo of a woman.

677
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:20,709
You have to guess,
whether she is

678
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:24,055
a professional newscaster
or a Hooters waitress.

679
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:25,464
Are you ready? Here we go."
[audience laugh]

680
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:27,989
- [Jennifer Pozner] The local news 
anchorships look like,

681
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:31,376
you know, somebody's grandfather
and his second wife.

682
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:35,290
- [Katie Couric] Television's a 
very visual medium, obviously,

683
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,182
and it's kind of how do you 
walk the fine line

684
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:43,138
of looking pleasing and attractive,
but also looking professional.

685
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:46,315
I look back on my *Today's Show*
interviews then I think,

686
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:48,658
"Geez, my skirt is way too short."

687
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,825
I sometimes worry that I started 
this thing with my legs and everything

688
00:39:54,594 --> 00:39:59,431
that I have sort of started this trend
of trying to look, you know...

689
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:00,634
I don't know.

690
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:05,138
- [Lisa Ling] There is so much pressure
to look a certain way.

691
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:10,644
When I'm on television, I never try 
and explicitly dress sexy.

692
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:13,812
I don't want to distract from 
the stories that I'm telling.

693
00:40:14,174 --> 00:40:15,678
- [Rachel Maddow] I want you 
to focus on what I'm saying.

694
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:17,726
There's a lot of words in my show
and I work really hard

695
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:20,132
on getting them in the right order.
[laughs]

696
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:21,717
For some people, I will always be

697
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:24,578
too hideous a creature
to be on television. That's fine.

698
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:27,821
But if you can get over that on day one,
it's gonna stay the same

699
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:29,453
for the whole time that I'm on the air.

700
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,964
- [Katie Couric] I think it's really hard 
for women today.

701
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,571
- *[Jennifer] The emphasis on 
women's appearance affects *

702
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:39,807
*more than just women on screen.*

703
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:44,808
*It's affecting women's ability
to participate in the political process.*

704
00:40:46,252 --> 00:40:51,688
*Ironically, the more power women gain,
the stronger the backlash against them.*

705
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,388
-*And this phenomenon is most evident *

706
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:57,873
*in the way the media disrespects 
our female leaders.*

707
00:40:59,654 --> 00:41:01,835
- "She's irresistibly cute. 
Let's put it that way.

708
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:05,186
In the way she presents herself, 
obviously, she's attractive and all that."

709
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:07,215
- "Sarah Palin looks 
really hot in that hat.

710
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:12,627
She's just sad that she
doesn't know how cars work.

711
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:15,285
Aww, that's crazy.
Have you seen the hat on her?"

712
00:41:15,718 --> 00:41:19,336
- "Both you and Sarah Palin 
are good looking women.

713
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,513
I mean, you're attractive, young,
relatively young women.

714
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,917
-"Kagan is gonna put on the
US Supreme Court

715
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:27,862
as there's such a thing about
the aesthetics of the appointee.

716
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:29,438
Let's put that here that so 
she's not your type of face

717
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:31,106
you'd wanna see 
on the five dollar bill."

718
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,098
- "I think I'm gonna send
Sotomayor and her club

719
00:41:34,098 --> 00:41:35,714
a bunch of vacuum cleaners

720
00:41:35,714 --> 00:41:37,670
to help them clean up
after their meetings."

721
00:41:38,274 --> 00:41:41,259
- "Cynthia McKinney, the former 
congresswoman from Georgia

722
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:43,147
was another angry black woman."

723
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:45,494
- "Look at these ugly skanks who make up

724
00:41:45,494 --> 00:41:48,797
the big female leadership 
of the democratic party."

725
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,202
- "You know that ugly hag,
Madeleine Albright, remember her?

726
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,653
A psycho. She was the Secretary 
of State under Clinton, remember?

727
00:41:54,653 --> 00:41:56,144
Like a fat moron."

728
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,113
- "And now we have the wicked witch
of the west, you know, that Nancy Pelosi."

729
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:03,335
- "I think if speaker Pelosi were still 
incapable of human facial expression,

730
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:04,997
we'd see she'd be embarrassed."

731
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:07,873
- "Nancy Pelosi, that--
Get another face lift, lady.

732
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:10,585
Another reason why it's very rare.

733
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:13,083
The final woman worthy
of serving in political off--"

734
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:16,967
*♪ Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead ♪*
- "And it's bye bye, Pelosi."

735
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:20,373
- "And Hilary Rodham Clinton,
her thighness, is no better

736
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,008
than Dumbo with the big ears."

737
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,340
- "When she raises her voice
and when a lot of women do, you know,

738
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,228
it's as I say, it reaches a point where--
- "Yeah, well, look, you know what?"

739
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:31,711
--with every husband in America
has heard it one time or another."

740
00:42:31,772 --> 00:42:34,833
- "You get a woman in the oval office, 
the most powerful person in the world,

741
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:37,148
what's the downside?"

742
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:39,740
- "You mean, besides the PMS 
and the mood swings."

743
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,826
- [Pat Mitchell] There's probably 
no more powerful influence

744
00:42:44,826 --> 00:42:48,489
in the way we view power than 
the way media treats power.

745
00:42:48,643 --> 00:42:52,687
And media treats power 
as defined by men,

746
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:56,314
because it has been
throughout our generation

747
00:42:56,314 --> 00:42:58,918
and the ones before 
generally define that way.

748
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:01,679
- [Erika Falk] When press representations 
of women who are, you know,

749
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,542
running for the highest office 
in the land are focusing, for example,

750
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:09,054
on how women look, 
instead of what they've done

751
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,815
or their issue positions. 
That's got to impact the audience

752
00:43:12,815 --> 00:43:15,393
in terms of how they evaluate 
and judge those women.

753
00:43:15,582 --> 00:43:17,891
One of the things it does 
is it trivializes them.

754
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:20,298
It makes women seem less powerful.

755
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,402
- [Jennifer Pozner] During the
Democratic National Convention in '84,

756
00:43:23,423 --> 00:43:25,513
when Geraldine Ferraro was running,

757
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:27,975
she was introduced on
national television as,

758
00:43:27,975 --> 00:43:31,767
"The first female vice presidential
candidate. Size six!"

759
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:34,975
So this is not new.

760
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:38,250
- [Debbie Walsh] My colleague did a study 
looking at Elizabeth Dole

761
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,897
and her race for President,
she was coming in second in Iowa

762
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:46,282
at the time after George Bush 
and there was much more coverage

763
00:43:46,282 --> 00:43:51,550
of her appearance than there was of the 
substance of what she was talking about.

764
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:54,858
- [Jennifer Lawless] When I ran for
Congress, I was campaigning

765
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:59,421
at grocery stores and a woman came up 
to me and she put her arms around me

766
00:43:59,457 --> 00:44:02,602
and she whispered, "Don't worry, 
you don't look nearly as fat in real life

767
00:44:02,602 --> 00:44:05,981
as you do on TV." 
The week before the election,

768
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:08,667
a man came up to me and he said, 
"You know, you seem great,

769
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:11,472
but I don't feel like
I could vote for you for Congress.

770
00:44:11,472 --> 00:44:13,356
I feel like I should hire you
as a babysitter."

771
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:16,259
- [Nancy Pelosi] When I first ran for
public office, which is now

772
00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:20,314
over 20 years ago, although my 
youngest was a senior in high school,

773
00:44:20,314 --> 00:44:22,329
the question I was most 
frequently asked was,

774
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:24,447
"Who's gonna be taking care 
of your children?"

775
00:44:24,648 --> 00:44:26,688
And of course it's one of
those questions that

776
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:30,325
I don't think a man has ever been asked
when he has run for office.

777
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,147
- [Erika Falk] If you look at
the women who ran,

778
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:35,000
who had honorary titles like, 
Senator Clinton,

779
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:40,156
if the press drops that title and 
instead refers to them as Mrs. Clinton,

780
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:43,064
this is a way to kind of diminish 
some of her accomplishments.

781
00:44:43,363 --> 00:44:47,367
$$ In John Boehner's first four weeks 
as Speaker of the House

782
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:51,407
$$ he was on the cover of five 
national weekly magazines.

783
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:53,331
$$ In Nancy Pelosi's four years
as Speaker of the House

784
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:55,073
$$ she was on the cover of zero
national weekly magazines.

785
00:44:55,227 --> 00:44:57,820
- [Dianne Feinstein] There is such a thing
as a media bias.

786
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,833
For example, media will write in the
same way about a man and a woman.

787
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:07,031
Senator X is a woman, 
complained that--

788
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:11,802
and in the same thing, 
Senator Y, stated that--

789
00:45:12,364 --> 00:45:14,315
So the man will get the <i>stated</i>

790
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:18,264
and the woman will get
the negative verb, <i>complained.</i>

791
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:23,155
- [Erika Falk] Women were twice as likely 
to be described emotionally as were men.

792
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:28,935
And by painting women as more emotional
than men, we perpetuate this stereotype

793
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,147
that women are emotional. 
Therefore, they're irrational.

794
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:32,977
Therefore they can't handle a crisis.

795
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:35,237
Therefore, they should not be
in leadership positions.

796
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:38,984
- [Condoleezza Rice] I remember 
so many times during the campaign,

797
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:42,210
people asking, "Will she tough enough
to be Commander-in-Chief?"

798
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,423
Well, I've know plenty of men who aren't 
tough enough to be Commander-in-Chief

799
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,628
and nobody asked that question.

800
00:45:47,628 --> 00:45:52,990
- "Making sure that these kids 
have a shot at the American dream...

801
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:57,472
[sobbing]
...my God, it's important."

802
00:45:57,694 --> 00:46:00,400
- "Gosh. What do you think 
they would have done to Nancy Pelosi

803
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,118
if she hadn't gotten all worked up?
They would've said she's unstable,

804
00:46:04,123 --> 00:46:08,326
couldn't do the job. 
Ooh, yes. Welcome to America."

805
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,133
- [Pat Mitchell] A woman in power 
is often seen as a negative thing.

806
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:20,673
We associate all the worst aspects 
of power and we translate those

807
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:23,948
to a woman seeking to achieve power.

808
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:26,053
- [Caroline Heldman] One of the key ways

809
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:31,109
in which media played a role 
in the primary, was to talk about

810
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:34,373
Hillary Clinton's ambition 
as though it were a bad thing.

811
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:39,831
- "When Barack Obama speaks, 
men hear, 'Take off for the future'.

812
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:44,455
And when Hillary Clinton speaks,
men hear, 'Take out the garbage.'"

813
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:48,098
- "When she reacts the way she reacts
to Obama with just a look,

814
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,487
the look toward him, 
looking like,

815
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:52,769
everyone's first wife standing 
outside a probate court."

816
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,376
- *"I don't know what they're 
getting at here, Tuck.*

817
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:55,686
*But what do you think are
they saying about Hillary?"*

818
00:46:55,686 --> 00:47:00,048
- "I don't know, but that is so perfect, 
a guy would have often said." [both laugh]

819
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:03,663
"When she comes on television,
I involuntarily cross my legs."

820
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:04,947
- "I know you do."

821
00:47:05,224 --> 00:47:09,381
- Hillary Clinton had hecklers
following her saying, "Iron my shirt."

822
00:47:09,544 --> 00:47:12,048
- "And some people think
- [Hecklers shouting] *"Iron my shirt!"*

823
00:47:12,048 --> 00:47:16,095
- we bring about saying, I--"
- *"Iron my shirt! Iron my shirt!"*

824
00:47:16,226 --> 00:47:19,455
- She was frequently called 
a bitch in mainstream media.

825
00:47:19,668 --> 00:47:23,168
- "She's a stereotypical bitch,
you know what I mean?"

826
00:47:23,316 --> 00:47:26,913
- "Obama did great in February that was
because it was black history month.

827
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:30,432
And now Hillary is doing much better
because it's white bitch month, right?"

828
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,741
- "If she knew how it made her look,
so alternately sappy and bitchy,

829
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:37,442
she'd stop it, but she can't
help herself, can she?"

830
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:39,637
- Her credentials were 
constantly questioned.

831
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:43,051
- "Let's not forget and I'll be brutal.
The reason she's a US Senator,

832
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:46,287
the reason she's a candidate for President,
the reason she may be a front runner,

833
00:47:46,287 --> 00:47:47,874
is her husband messed around."
-"Yeah, but--"

834
00:47:47,874 --> 00:47:50,827
"That's how she got to be Senator 
for New York. We keep forgetting it.

835
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:52,282
She didn't win there on her merit."

836
00:47:55,297 --> 00:47:57,925
*- [Carololine] Sarah Palin presented 
a very different image. *

837
00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:02,154
She is the first national high profiled
female candidate

838
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:07,547
who presented herself in very
feminine terms as a "real woman."

839
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:09,960
- "She's the American dream. 
Women want to be her.

840
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,195
Men want to mate with her.
I wanna lay her next to me in bed."

841
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:18,551
- There were pictures shot 
between her legs of folks

842
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:20,579
at the Republican National Convention.

843
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:24,643
In a nutshell, she was
<i>pornified</i> and <i>ditzified</i>

844
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:28,277
"I don't wanna say she's a ditz,
but last night,

845
00:48:28,277 --> 00:48:30,968
my stripper's fake name 
was Sarah Palin." *[crowd laughs]*

846
00:48:31,356 --> 00:48:34,360
- "Yo, let me tell you somethin' 
'bout Sarah Palin, man, [all laugh]

847
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:38,017
she's good masturbation material."
- [Together] Oh! [all laugh]

848
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,746
- So, Hillary Clinton tried to be 
properly masculine

849
00:48:40,746 --> 00:48:43,387
and properly feminine and she lost.

850
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:48,132
Sarah Palin puts out this different image 
of, shall we say hyper femininity,

851
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:51,370
and she gets beaten up in
really degrading gendered ways.

852
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:57,932
- "But tonight we are crossing party lines 
to address the now very ugly role

853
00:48:57,963 --> 00:49:00,985
that sexism is playing in the campaign."

854
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:06,037
- "An issue which I am frankly, surprised 
to hear, people suddenly care about."

855
00:49:06,037 --> 00:49:08,491
*[crowd laughs]*

856
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,167
- "Reporters and commentators 
stop using words

857
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:16,305
that diminish us, like pretty, 
attractive, beautiful--"

858
00:49:16,326 --> 00:49:20,784
- "Harpy, shrewd, boner shrinker."

859
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:25,155
*[crowd laughs and applauds]*

860
00:49:26,136 --> 00:49:30,050
- [Cory Booker] My worry is now that 
there are millions of people watching

861
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,685
Sarah Palin, Hillary Clinton... 
I could talk to about a lot of women

862
00:49:33,685 --> 00:49:36,098
there in New Jersey politics.
There are millions of young women

863
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,071
watching this and the messages 
that they're getting are just not

864
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,171
conducive to encouraging them
to put up with this kind of abuse.

865
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:47,022
- [Gavin Newsom] When you're not
treated the same, you are dehumanized.

866
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:50,261
When you're not given the same
opportunity, you're dehumanized.

867
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:53,466
When people look at you differently 
because you happen to be a woman

868
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:58,954
and you happen to be in a position 
of some influence that someone who is a man,

869
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,634
would naturally be in based
on tradition or history

870
00:50:02,634 --> 00:50:06,344
and people question your qualifications, 
that's dehumanizing.

871
00:50:06,554 --> 00:50:12,383
- [Thomas] Empowered women in general,
threaten men because they feel

872
00:50:12,383 --> 00:50:15,737
that an empowered woman 
is just putting down a man

873
00:50:15,983 --> 00:50:19,654
as opposed to trying 
to sort of raise herself.

challenging men's power, in business,

875
00:50:23,211 --> 00:50:25,364
in the professions, in education,

876
00:50:25,364 --> 00:50:29,493
and in politics and other areas
of social life,

877
00:50:31,182 --> 00:50:33,300
the images of women that have
been flooding their culture,

878
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,224
have been showing women 
as taking up less space.

879
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:39,061
They're less threatening.
They're highly sexualized.

880
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:42,747
And therefore, a certain kind of power
has been taken away from them,

881
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:44,677
which is a power of being
a whole person.

882
00:50:46,554 --> 00:50:49,894
And I don't think those things
are coincidental. I think that the way

883
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:54,060
that the symbolic realm has been acting 
as to take power away from women,

884
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,354
while women have been challenging
men's power in the concrete realm.

the people behind the scenes *

about what we see?*

for my daughter and her generation?*

890

- [Barbara J. Berg] The media
has always been,

891
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:51,029
overwhelmingly,
in the hands of men.

in media, fewer and fewer women

894

at every rung of the ladder.

897

- [Carol Jenkins] That means that 97% 
of everything you know about yourself

898
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,822
and about your country and your world,
comes from the male perspective.

899
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:16,684
It doesn't mean that it's wrong,
it just means that in a democracy,

900
00:52:16,684 --> 00:52:20,018
where you talk about equality 
and full participation,

901
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:22,179
you've got half of the population,

902
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:24,441
more than half of the population,
not participating.

"Why don't we just create our own network,

904
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:34,706
other than continuing to try and get our
stories told by other people's networks?"

905
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:39,202
So, we put together an idea.
We went to various distributors,

906
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:42,435
including the broadcast networks, 
the cable companies, etcetera,

907
00:52:42,435 --> 00:52:45,980
pitched the idea 
and one person said to me,

908
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,001
"Well, why do we need
another women's network?

909

pervasive sense of denial

about the status of women working 
in both television and film.

913

Peter Bart wrote a column in *Variety, *
talking about the glass ceiling

other people tend to hire people

who are a reflection of themselves.

923
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:43,402
- [Barbara J. Berg] This impacts hiring. 
It impacts the news, directors,

00:53:43,402 --> 00:53:46,330
the journalists, the people who are 
gonna cover the news,

925
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:48,316
and of course, who reports the news?

926
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:53,019
Very much is the factor
in what kind of news is reported.

is not featured in the media,

they have to wonder, "Well,
what part do I play in this culture?"

930
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:10,483
There's actually an 
academic term for that.

It's called, symbolic annihilation.

[nuclear explosion]

933
00:54:29,627 --> 00:54:34,497
- [Geena Davis] All of Hollywood 
is run on one assumption

934
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:39,671
that women will watch stories about men,
but men won't watch stories about women.

935
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:48,795
And all the decisions are made 
based on this concrete fact

936
00:54:48,795 --> 00:54:52,600
and nobody's ever really proved
that that's true.

937
00:54:52,716 --> 00:54:55,772
I think it's a horrible indictment 
of our society, if we assume

938
00:54:55,772 --> 00:55:00,695
that one half of the population
is just not interested in the other half.

939
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:05,102
- [Catherine Hardwicke] The first couple 
of scripts that I wrote, of course,

940
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:09,363
had a female, you know, as a lead
character and people will look,

941
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:12,158
"Well, there's hardly 
any bankable actresses."

942
00:55:12,162 --> 00:55:16,103
So, they can't carry a film. 
So, it has to be super low budget

943
00:55:16,103 --> 00:55:19,939
or we wouldn't bankroll it and no one's 
gonna show up in the theaters

944
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:25,727
and I finally wrote the lowest
budget movie I could ever write.

945
00:55:25,794 --> 00:55:29,087
I co-wrote <i>Thirteen</i> 
with a 13-year old girl

946
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:32,056
*and it was about people 
of lower income.*

947
00:55:32,056 --> 00:55:34,246
*They could wear my clothes.
We could shoot in my house.*

948
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:37,499
*We could use my car. 
We made the movie and it went on*

949
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:41,461
*to Sundance and it went on to win awards
and get international distribution*

950
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:44,943
*and I think it was the same
like, with* Twilight.

951
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:50,116
*Two major studios turned it down. 
Finally, a new upstart company showed me*

952
00:55:50,116 --> 00:55:54,323
*the project and it turned into 
obviously, a phenomenon making*

953
00:55:54,323 --> 00:55:58,395
*over half a billion dollars so far.
So, it is proved the theory*

954
00:55:58,395 --> 00:56:01,711
*that girls and women
wouldn't go to see a movie,*

955
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:05,721
but they did go see the movie in droves.
And over and over and over.

956
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:08,641
And bought the DVD 
and even bought pillowcases.

957
00:56:10,357 --> 00:56:13,951
But there is a flip side to that, 
which is kind of astonishing to me.

958
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:17,589
On the next two <i>Twilight,</i>
they've hired guys.

959
00:56:17,765 --> 00:56:21,372
*They did not seek out a female director
and on the same side, *

960
00:56:21,372 --> 00:56:26,351
I've gone after some jobs that I've been
told flat out to myself and my agent,

961
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:29,197
"Oh no, we think a guy
should direct this."

962
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:32,130
*And to me, I think,
"Okay, can a man direct, you know,*

963

Sex and the City, Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants,

964

*the *Miley Cyrus* movie?"
Nobody ever questions that.*

965
00:56:38,124 --> 00:56:41,973
But I, a very successful female 
director, cannot direct a movie

966
00:56:41,973 --> 00:56:43,729
that should be done by a man.

"I'm not gonna hire a female director."

On their list, there's just 25 names
and none of them are women.

969

writer, producers or directors,

971
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,927
we see the world in a certain way

972
00:57:00,978 --> 00:57:05,634
and we don't really challenge that often
and so we just replicate the world

really asking why we're doing it.

what the response was gonna be

989
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,466
to *Thelma and Louise.* 
One time I was at a red light

990
00:58:00,974 --> 00:58:03,691
and I heard this honking
and I looked next to me, and it's

991
00:58:03,706 --> 00:58:06,953
a car full of women who are
popping out of all the windows

992
00:58:06,953 --> 00:58:10,340
and the sunroof and going, 
"Whoo-hoo!"

993
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:13,574
[laughs] I'm like,
"Well this is certainly never been

994
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:16,675
a reaction to my any of my other movies."

995
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:22,459
Then the very next movie I made was
*A League of Their Own,* where I had

996
00:58:22,459 --> 00:58:26,806
13 or 15 year old girls coming up to me
with the same kind of reactions,

997
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:28,886
"Oh my God. You have no idea 
that movie changed my life.

I played sports 
because of that movie."

999

and reflect the views of the society.

Or it can hopefully awaken people 
and change minds.

there's no question.

1302
01:15:35,513 --> 01:15:37,253
This is about adult men.

1303
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:40,469
- [Calvin] I definitely am not one 
to conform to the--

1304
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:45,442
we need to be hyper masculine and 
we need to be misogynistic stereotypes.

1305
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:52,840
It really puts a lot of pressure on me 
when I have relatives who have grown up

1306
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:57,857
with this phenomenon, who attempt 
to put me on that path,

1307
01:15:57,857 --> 01:15:59,245
but I'm not ready for it.

1308
01:15:59,345 --> 01:16:02,350
- [Cory Booker] I remember sitting down
having this conversation with a woman

1309
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,438
far wiser than me 
and stories to talk about,

1310
01:16:05,438 --> 01:16:09,573
"Oh, how bad it is for women in America,"
and she just looked at me

1311
01:16:09,573 --> 01:16:11,229
and listened to me 
for a while and she said,

1312
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:12,265
"Well, I have to tell you, Cory,

1313
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:14,426
I actually think it's really bad 
for men in America."

1314
01:16:14,426 --> 01:16:16,185
And I go, "What do you mean?" 
She started talking to me

1315
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:20,042
and really putting the spotlight on me
and talking about how emotionally

1316
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,042
constipated men are taught 
to be very early on,

1317
01:16:23,273 --> 01:16:28,083
how we don't have-- haven't learned 
how to express ourselves in healthy ways,

1318
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:32,957
it often does manifest itself in such 
awful and violent ways.

1319
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:37,050
But she talked about a spiritual healing
that was needed for guys.

1320
01:16:48,245 --> 01:16:49,930
- *[Jennifer] I've been trying to imagine*

1321
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:52,580
*a better world for my 
daughter's generation.*

1322
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,858
*And I'm beginning to get some ideas.*

1323
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,462
"The numbers of women 
in leadership positions

1324
01:16:58,462 --> 01:17:01,130
in our country are still very low."

1325
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:04,588
*We have to find a way
to change this culture.*

1326
01:17:05,518 --> 01:17:08,189
We need to shift our focus
from the bottom line

1327
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:11,895
*to one of social responsibility. 
We need to challenge *

1328
01:17:11,895 --> 01:17:14,326
*the media conglomerates
to value women *

1329
01:17:14,326 --> 01:17:17,585
*for more than their youth, 
beauty and sexuality.*

1330
01:17:17,957 --> 01:17:20,530
*And we must hold
these companies accountable. *

1331
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:22,926
*We need to encourage women *

1332
01:17:22,926 --> 01:17:26,258
*to discover their true power,
so they can become leaders.*

1333
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:28,521
*And we must support them 
on their journey.*

1334
01:17:28,829 --> 01:17:32,753
$$ 70% of women in the workforce 
are mothers

1335
01:17:32,753 --> 01:17:37,015
$$ yet we have no national paid family 
leave, childcare or flex time policy

1336
01:17:37,092 --> 01:17:41,969
*And ultimately, we need to live our 
own vision of what a woman can be.*

1337
01:17:42,061 --> 01:17:45,570
$$ Be the change you want 
to see in the world.

1338
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:48,602
$$ - Mahatma Gandhi

1339
01:17:48,993 --> 01:17:52,308
- [Condoleezza Rice] We make a mistake 
when we say, you have to find

1340
01:17:52,308 --> 01:17:54,310
role models who look like you.

1341
01:17:55,232 --> 01:18:00,084
If Sally Ride, my dear friend,
first female astronaut had been waiting

1342
01:18:00,084 --> 01:18:04,771
for a female astronaut role model,
she would never have done it.

1343
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:08,433
And so, I'm a big believer 
in finding your role models

1344
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:10,172
wherever you can find them.

1345
01:18:10,172 --> 01:18:13,495
In people who inspire and
stimulate you for whatever reason.

1346
01:18:14,141 --> 01:18:15,568
- [Jan Yanehiro] Growing up,
there was nobody

1347
01:18:15,568 --> 01:18:17,207
who looked like me on television,

1348
01:18:17,323 --> 01:18:20,204
so I never dreamed 
that I could be on television.

1349
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:24,938
I would love to say, "Yeah, there were
some great women role models back then."

1350
01:18:24,938 --> 01:18:27,019
Actually, there were none.

1351
01:18:27,019 --> 01:18:32,298
Years later, Connie Chung went on
television to report in Watergate,

1352
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,987
and I would say to her, 
"Connie, you're my role model."

1353
01:18:34,987 --> 01:18:37,319
She would say to me,
"Jan, but I'm not that old."

1354
01:18:37,468 --> 01:18:39,851
And I say, "Yeah, you're a year 
older than I am, Connie

1355
01:18:39,851 --> 01:18:41,208
and that's good enough for me."

1356
01:18:41,499 --> 01:18:44,151
- [Katie Couric] In terms of my
role models in television news,

1357
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:46,539
of course, Barbara Walters,
Lesley Stahl,

1358
01:18:46,539 --> 01:18:49,080
and believe it or not,
Mary Tyler Moore.

1359
01:18:49,212 --> 01:18:52,561
*I grew up watching that show 
and the notion of a woman*

1360
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:56,347
making it on her own
and working at that TV station,

1361
01:18:56,347 --> 01:18:59,175
I think was, very, very influential.

1362
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:00,875
- [Rachel Maddow] One of the things
that really surprised me

1363
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:05,616
was the number of women
in positions of power in television

1364
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:07,083
who reached out to me and said,

1365
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:09,467
"Can I take you out to breakfast?" 
"Can I take you out to lunch?"

1366
01:19:09,467 --> 01:19:11,819
"Can I make sure that you have 
my phone number or my email address,

1367
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:16,669
so that if anything comes up--" and
it definitely wasn't like a gender mafia

1368
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:20,732
going on in the media, 
but there was an over effort

1369
01:19:20,732 --> 01:19:25,563
to both welcome me and make me know
that women who had gone before me,

1370
01:19:25,563 --> 01:19:28,443
who had fought to get where they were,
were both happy that I was there

1371
01:19:28,443 --> 01:19:30,231
and wanted to be resources to me.

1372
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:33,096
And there's an expectation that 
I will be a resource to other women.

1373
01:19:35,047 --> 01:19:38,466
*- [Jennifer] When women mentor each other,
it can be incredibly powerful.*

1374
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:43,621
*I got to know a talented young 
journalist named, Jessica Shambora.*

1375
01:19:44,263 --> 01:19:48,169
*Jessica was covering a story for*
Fortune *magazine about mentorship.*

1376
01:19:48,438 --> 01:19:50,210
*That really proves the point.*

1377
01:19:50,454 --> 01:19:51,995
- [Jessica Shambora] I just wanted to 
introduce myself to you, guys.

1378
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:56,667
*I'm Jessica Shambora. I'm with <i>Fortune</i>,
and so we'd be covering the event tonight.*

1379
01:19:56,667 --> 01:20:00,599
Mini-mentoring is a program 
that a couple of the women

1380
01:20:00,599 --> 01:20:05,298
from <i>Fortune's</i> most powerful women 
<i>Summit</i> came up with, in order to reach

1381
01:20:05,298 --> 01:20:09,520
a larger group of young women
who really have this desire to be mentored

1382
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,485
and get advice from successful 
professional women.

1383
01:20:12,567 --> 01:20:14,672
They would have sort of like,
a speed dating night,

1384
01:20:14,672 --> 01:20:17,883
except for substitute, 
mentoring for the dating.

1385
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:19,607
*- [Dee Dee Myers] The most important 
thing that should drive decisions,*

1386
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:20,805
*especially when you're young is*

1387
01:20:20,805 --> 01:20:22,974
what really get your 
heart pitter-pattering.

1388
01:20:22,974 --> 01:20:24,991
- [Candy Crowley] In the end, 
here's the deal.

1389
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:29,842
You wanna be so good at what you do,
that they can't ignore you.

1390
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:32,928
- [Dana Perino] Turn off the 
television and read.

1391
01:20:32,928 --> 01:20:35,712
One hour of reality TV can be fun.

1392
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:39,467
Four hours is like destructive.
*[others laughing]*

1393
01:20:39,518 --> 01:20:42,304
- [Susan Molinari] To thine own self, 
be true. Know who you are.

1394
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:46,690
Know what is best about you. 
Have confidence in yourself

1395
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:48,692
and don't try and be anybody else.

1396

- [Dana Perino] On Tony Snow's last day, 
when he was leaving the white house

1397
01:20:50,575 --> 01:20:53,582
and I was taking over officially as
the White House Press secretary,

1398
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:56,195
he came into my office and he said,

1399
01:20:56,195 --> 01:20:58,827
"You are better at this
than you think you are."

1400
01:20:59,903 --> 01:21:02,671
*- [Susan Molinari] I hope you will
remember that you will help*

1401
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,797
that next generation of women a lot.

1402
01:21:05,013 --> 01:21:08,581
It is far overdue that we, women, 
stop criticizing each other,

1403
01:21:08,581 --> 01:21:11,892
the decisions and the life decisions 
that we make and instead say,

1404
01:21:11,892 --> 01:21:15,176
"Alleluia, sister. Whatever gets you 
through, I'm there to support you."

1405

*[cheers and applause]*

1406
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:23,328
- [Lisa Ling] You know, if women
don't stand up for each other,

1407
01:21:23,328 --> 01:21:25,024
then no one else will.
No one's gonna look out

1408
01:21:25,024 --> 01:21:27,682
for the interest of women,
except other women.

1409
01:21:29,746 --> 01:21:34,223
- [Katie Couric] If women spent 
more time helping a sick neighbor

1410
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:37,392
or volunteering at a homeless shelter, 
or focusing on how to use

1411
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:40,657
all their energy to solve 
some of the world's problems,

1412
01:21:40,657 --> 01:21:44,609
if they spent a tenth of the time thinking
about those things than they do thinking

1413
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:49,535
about their weight, I mean, I think,
we'd solve all the world's problems

1414
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:50,795
in a matter of months.

1415
01:21:51,205 --> 01:21:53,649
- [Dianne Feinstein] We're here for 
an instant in an eternity.

1416
01:21:53,814 --> 01:21:57,489
And all that really matters
is what we do with that time

1417
01:21:57,845 --> 01:22:00,629
- [Pat Mitchell] We have enormous power. 
Eighty six percent of the

1418
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:05,073
purchasing power in this country
is in the pockets of women.

1419
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:09,718
Well, let's use it. I mean, let's use it
not to buy those tabloid magazines

1420
01:22:09,718 --> 01:22:12,761
and not to support the 
tabloid television shows.

1421
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,309
A consumer's voice is maybe

1422
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:17,317
the most important,
powerful voice we have,

1423
01:22:17,317 --> 01:22:20,977
other than as a citizen
and using our vote.

1424
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:25,722
- [Nancy Pelosi] Women in America
will be more encouraged

1425
01:22:25,722 --> 01:22:29,541
if they could see young women
who share their experience

1426
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:35,876
raising a young family, speaking for them,
identifying with their aspirations.

1427
01:22:36,283 --> 01:22:38,634
- [Rosario Dawson] We're creating
new leaders and they're going

1428
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:42,437
to not look like how they always did.
An older white male.

1429
01:22:42,634 --> 01:22:46,234
They're gonna look like a woman and
they're gonna look like people of color

1430
01:22:46,234 --> 01:22:50,739
and that is the true reflection 
of this country and of this world.

1431
01:22:51,857 --> 01:22:53,852
- [Marie Wilson] I got this 
little letter one day.

1432
01:22:53,852 --> 01:22:57,852
"Ms. Wilson, do you realize there has 
never been a woman president?"

1433
01:22:57,852 --> 01:23:01,769
And then she said, "I will make a 
great president. I'm practicing my piano,

1434
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:06,559
I'm doing my Math and my name is 
Alexandra, which means leader of men."

1435
01:23:08,999 --> 01:23:12,030
- [Jennifer] Look at the eyes. Oh, honey. 
*- Oh, oh, oh.*

1436
01:23:12,062 --> 01:23:12,877

<i>[giggles]</i>

1438
01:23:13,832 --> 01:23:15,771
- Hello.

1439
01:23:17,108 --> 01:23:18,961
Oh, she's smiling.

1440
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:25,884
On September 18th 2009, 
I began my journey into motherhood.

1441
01:23:27,594 --> 01:23:29,632
My husband and I have the same wishes

1442
01:23:29,632 --> 01:23:32,870
for Montana that any parents
have for their child.

1443
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:37,147
We want her to pursue her purpose 
and passions in life

1444
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,097
and to understand 
that what's really important

1445
01:23:40,097 --> 01:23:42,734
is who she is on the inside.

1446
01:23:43,753 --> 01:23:46,706
And it's critical to us 
that all girls grow up in a world

1447
01:23:46,706 --> 01:23:48,831
where their voice counts,

1448
01:23:48,962 --> 01:23:52,327
where our culture embraces them 
in all of their diversity

1449
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:55,822
and where they're afforded 
equal opportunities to succeed in life.

1450
01:23:58,306 --> 01:24:00,814
I keep coming back to my early years.

1451
01:24:01,644 --> 01:24:05,953
Too often, we girls and women 
don't recognize our own internal strength.

1452
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:13,975
I now know that we can't let anyone
or anything take our power away from us.

1453
01:24:18,059 --> 01:24:20,238
What do you think, Montana?

1454
01:24:21,573 --> 01:24:23,175
Are you ready?

1455

$$ Join the Movement
www.missrepresentation.org

1456
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:32,820
- If we really want things 
to change around you,

1457
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,730
here's what you can do.

$$ Text REPRESENT to

1459
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:41,242
- Measure yourself by accomplishments
and not by how you look.

1460
01:24:41,422 --> 01:24:44,831
- If you and I, every time
we pass a mirror,

1461
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:47,358
downgrade on how we look,
or complain about our looks,

1462
01:24:47,358 --> 01:24:51,851
if we remember that a girl is watching us,
and that's what she's learning.

1463
01:24:52,175 --> 01:24:54,743
- Reflect on the ways you 
may contribute to sexism.

1464
01:24:54,943 --> 01:24:58,695
- I include myself in this. 
We scrutinize the women.

1465
01:24:58,772 --> 01:25:01,325
"God, look how old she's gotten,
look how gray she's gotten.

1466
01:25:01,325 --> 01:25:02,585
What is she wearing?"

1467
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:06,366
I think that as women, we need to stop 
that destructive behavior

1468
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:10,500
that we inflict upon each other
and ultimately onto ourselves.

1469
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:13,643
- Support media that champions 
accomplished women.

1470
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:18,649
- We need strong women role models who
in the media because they did something,

1471
01:25:18,806 --> 01:25:21,126
because they're doing great work, 
not because they have

1472
01:25:21,126 --> 01:25:25,268
the most bangin' body
and they're sexiest woman of 2010.

1473
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,155
They're the best philanthropists.

1474
01:25:27,192 --> 01:25:30,598
They're the best in the medical field
and it's not about the way they look,

1475
01:25:30,598 --> 01:25:32,595
it's about who they are inside.

1476
01:25:33,655 --> 01:25:37,681
- Boycott magazines, TV shows and movies 
that objectify and degrade women.

1477
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:41,687
- Speaking your mind and criticizing
media companies when you think

1478
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:43,783
they're doing things that are 
inappropriate at your children,

1479
01:25:43,783 --> 01:25:47,958
is not just your God-given right
as an American, as a parent,

1480
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:50,979
but it's also entirely consistent 
with the First Amendment.

1481
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:54,080
- Go see movies written 
and directed by women.

1482
01:25:54,565 --> 01:25:59,043
- And it's important to go on opening 
weekend and Friday is best

1483
01:25:59,843 --> 01:26:02,269
because these are the numbers 
that Hollywood tracks.

1484
01:26:02,689 --> 01:26:05,426
- Write your own stories 
and create your own media

1485
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:08,374
about powerful women
in non-traditional roles.

1486
01:26:08,737 --> 01:26:10,929
- My daughter, when she was nine, 
she wrote this little screenplay

1487
01:26:10,929 --> 01:26:13,169
and she shot a movie you know,
with our little video camera,

1488
01:26:13,169 --> 01:26:16,689
with her you know, casting her friends 
and it was just so much fun for her

1489
01:26:16,689 --> 01:26:19,854
and it teaches them that the media 
are a construction.

1490
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,119
And they start to understand

1491
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:23,167
that these are stories that people
are telling them and they can come up

1492
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:25,892
with their own stories to tell back
and very often, they can be you know,

1493
01:26:25,892 --> 01:26:27,920
subversive stories, resistant stories.

1494
01:26:28,196 --> 01:26:31,128
- Teach those around you 
to look at the media critically.

1495
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:36,325
- Well, one thing that I do with my kids, 
is I watch these shows with them,

1496
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:40,305
I say, "Hey, did you notice 
there's only one female in that group?"

1497
01:26:40,373 --> 01:26:44,632
and, "What if that character 
had been a girl, instead?"

1498
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:48,769
and, "Why is she wearing that when
she's trying to rescue somebody?"

1499
01:26:49,476 --> 01:26:52,469
- Ask your school to start 
a media literacy course

1500
01:26:52,469 --> 01:26:54,289
focused on gender issues.

1501
01:26:54,644 --> 01:26:59,104
- We need media literacy as much I think, 
as we need to learn to read.

1502
01:26:59,243 --> 01:27:02,729
Our responses should be, "Whose 
perspectives are framing this story?"

1503
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:05,856
"There are always more than 
two sides to every story."

1504
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,241
"Are we being sold here?"

1505
01:27:08,452 --> 01:27:10,341
- Don't be afraid
to challenge your friends

1506
01:27:10,341 --> 01:27:13,265
if you hear them saying 
derogatory things about women.

1507
01:27:13,477 --> 01:27:17,876
- King said it very eloquently, "The
problem today is not the vitriolic words

1508
01:27:17,876 --> 01:27:19,782
and the evil actions
and the bad people,

1509
01:27:19,782 --> 01:27:23,078
it's the appalling silencing 
and inaction of the good people."

1510
01:27:23,275 --> 01:27:26,299
- Find healthy role models
and be a mentor to others.

1511
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:30,670
- Encourage women to become leaders
- and support them in the process.

1512
01:27:31,023 --> 01:27:35,055
- If we see women who we think
would be excellent at any political job,

1513
01:27:35,055 --> 01:27:38,131
whether it's dog catchers, 
school board member,

1514
01:27:38,131 --> 01:27:42,108
or member of Congress, 
we need to make that known.

1515
01:27:42,663 --> 01:27:46,079
- "Whatever women do, they must do 
twice as well as a man

1516
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:48,776
to be thought of as half as good.

1517
01:27:48,968 --> 01:27:51,841
Luckily, that's not too difficult."

1518

$$ Miss Representation 
would not be possible

1519

initially believed in another.

1520
