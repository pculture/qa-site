00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,139
But the way that the sports 
developed since then.

159
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,829
You know it's very... 
one of the safest sports around.

160
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:28,423
*Rodeo's, people die you know. 
all the time, in rodeos*

161
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:30,447
*They die in NASCAR. All the time*

162
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:33,024
*But because this is a new sport
people don't know what it is*

163
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:34,719
*And they see so much blood, 
they don't understand.*

164
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,895
Blood is superficial. 
These guys has four ounce gloves on.

165
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:38,804
*They don't have 16 ounce gloves on.* 
[Thud!]

166
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:40,374
*So there's no brain damage.*

167
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,136
*They're getting punched 
with a 4 ounce glove.*

168
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:45,772
*If a guy in the ring is hurt, 
the referee will stop the fight.*

169
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:47,311
*That won't happen in boxing.*

170
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:50,002
*His heirarchy has to be on the ground 
he can even be hurt.*

171
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:52,284
*So as long as he can stand himself up*
*He could continue to fight.*

172
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:54,017
*And that doesn't happen in MMA either.*

173
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:59,619
*I knew when I started dating him 
that he was a former boxer.*

174
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:03,608
*That he wrestled also, Pro, 
which I thought was insane.*

175

Uh! Uh!

178
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,708
- [Gil's Wife] 
It's in his blood. I mean my son's 5.

179
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,609
*And you know he's gonna fight one day.*

180
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:26,891
*You know, as safe as it is,
you still don't wanna see your son *

*even fall off his bike. You know. *

182

And he's gonna fight one day. 
I will not be able to stop him.

183
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:32,428
It's in his blood.

184
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:34,738
My husband, when we argue 
he goes to the gym and spars.

185
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:38,238
*And comes back 
much better, much better.*

186
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,563
There's a lot of skill involved.

187
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:44,114
It's not just some, you know, bar fight.

188
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,152
If the guys calls all the time

189

"I wanna fight" , "I wanna fight"
"I wanna fight"

190
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,356
Well, if you're not trained. 
You know we can't put you in there.

191
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:48,966
It's not safe.

192
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:52,580
- *[Gil] Yeah this is a rodeo arena 
But you still not gonna fight on my show.*

193
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,686
A lot of these kids that call me up.

194
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,932
Wanting to fight, 
think they first have the ability.

195
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:01,944
Then they think it's just, it's easy. 
Let's go and do it

196
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:04,760
So, I as a 38,39 year old man

197
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,054
The first thing I do
is go to the gym and I'll spar 'em.

198
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:14,360
[swoosh] [ thud, thud]

199
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,109
Five guys walking off the street, 
I'm looking for one thing,

200
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,176
all of them wanna be 
world champion.

201
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:22,093
But the most important thing is, 
<i>Dedication</i>

202
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:23,871
[thud, thud, thud]

[timer ringing]

-*[Tim] Don't commit to run.*

205
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:31,806
*Commit to the exchange.
You're committing to not getting hurt.*

206
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:34,885
- *[Albert Stainback] Actually, quite 
afraid of being hit when I'm in the gym.*

207
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:36,665
*It sucks! You know you feel it.*

208
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:41,564
*But when I'm fighting, I just wanna 
hit 'em and it just happens.*

209
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:46,113
*And I hit them. And they fall 
unconscious and I feel good.*

210
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:50,635
*The energy in the cage makes
the whole thing feel spiritual for me.*

211
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:52,565
Like another world

212
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:54,934
It's almost like the universe 
is this big machine.

213
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,548
And I am, you know, I'm operating it.

214
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:58,850
I don't believe in God.

215
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,928
I don't believe in destiny.

216
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,222
I don't believe in predetermination 
or whatever anything like that.

217
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:09,058
But I will say I am dazzled 
by the way I look at my life,

218
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:12,387
the way it's turned out and the way it's 
just like interconnected with fighting

219
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:16,429
the way I feel it is.

220
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:19,650
It's the only thing that I really think 
I'm good at, if anything.

221
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,456
You know if you could say 
I'm good at anything, it would be that.

222
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:22,262
- *[Gil] Guy's got a lot of talent.*

223
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:24,292
*He's not a bad looking kid. *

224
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,848
*But I see potential in him 
outside of fighting.*

225
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:29,102
*I think that if he really 
put himself to anything.*

226
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:31,050
*He can do anything, he wanted to do.*

227
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,740
- [Albert] I kinda wanted to be my 
only option.

228
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,889
Cause I love it that much.

229
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,603
Maybe that's a little fool hearted, 
but I don't care.

230
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:39,310
- [Gil] Many mistakes 
that a young fighter are making.

231
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,017
I guess, the most important one.

232
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:45,402
Is that they're forgetting. 
That there's life after fighting.

233
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:46,648
Pursuing that MMA dream.

234
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:48,276
You know I can't fault anybody for that.

235
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:52,120
Because I pursued my own dream. 
But I did work at the same time.

236
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,134
I went to college at the same time.

237
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:55,783
You don't understood 
the sheer dynamics of it.

238
00:12:55,783 --> 00:13:00,345
Most fighters 99% of fighters 
end up broken and destitute.

239
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:03,529
That's just the truth of it.

240
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,650
They might make a little bit of money 
here and there.

241
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,281
But most fighters, most people 
climbing into the ring or the cage

242
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:09,568
don't make a penny.

243

*- [Tim] You try to help them 
the best you can*

244

But they're not my children. 
So what can I do?

245
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,860
- [Gil] Give them advice, that's about it.

246

Keep going with USA - MMA and [laughs]

nobody's ever heard of.

August 1st, Tonight. SugArena.

*It's gonna happen tonight guys. 
We have 14 bouts.*

against Albert Stainback.*

*He's from Gladiator, Lafayette.*

260
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:09,990
- [Albert Stainback] I think a stare down. 
Is something very important for a fight.

261
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,987
And yes I do practice in the mirror

262
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:14,929
I'll sit in the mirror in the bathroom 
and just be like. [deep breathing]

263
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:17,641
If you're staring them down

264
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,435
And you see that certain look

265
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:22,640
I believed that you know, 
you're already in their head.

266
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:25,487
And that, and that helps.
You know.

267
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:27,800
But then you get those people, 
and this is when you know

268
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,026
It's gonna be a fight.

269
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:31,959
When they just look 
right back at you dude...

270
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,611
And it's a..
I like those even better actually.

271
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:36,164
I like it when they grind, you know, right back.

272
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:38,295
When they are not scared.

273
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,549
When they do not back down. I love it!

274
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,091
- [Dustin Poirier] People feel the same
way when they get in the cage.

275
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,516
But other people in the outside
don't really notice it how,

276
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:49,085
you know, unless they do it,
how peaceful it really is inside there.

277
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:52,567
It's crazy, so pure.

278
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,434
- [Albert] When Dustin's in there
he looks like a serial killer.

279
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,733
You know and I feel like the same,
about myself.

*I'm the commissioner, 
For Athletics in State of Louisiana.*

287
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:21,666
The reason we're here primarily, the rules are followed

00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,152
and safety, safety,safety is followed.

There's a lot of amateur fights 
on this card tonight.

290
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:32,346
We'll stop the fight 
before it gets to trouble

291
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:36,142
I'm just telling you right up, fellas. 
I don't want anybody getting hurt.

292
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:39,793
We all know that when we come in
here that anybody.

293
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:42,846
Anybody. Anybody can get 
severely injured in this sport.

294
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:46,317
It's happened before.
I'm sure it's gonna happen again.

295
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,049
You take that chance 
when you go in that ring.

I happen to think

The biggest challenge now, 
when it comes to a kid like Dustin,

is, you know finding somebody's
not gonna kill in a couple of minutes.

- [Gil] Will he make it to the UFC? 
Will he be world champion?

358
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,898
Yeah... Potential.
But potential has a time frame.

*"You still have potential,"*

it's time to move on, you know?

So, I give Tim's gym. Probably, 
the nod as far as overall talent.

out of all the little kids, the little guys that boxed.

lose this fight?

even tougher guys now."

This is Lafayette, Louisiana.
