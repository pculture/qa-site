157
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,875
<i>There was no rules at all</i>

158
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,139
But the way that the sports 
developed since then.

159
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,829
You know it's very... 
one of the safest sports around.

160
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:28,423
<i>Rodeo's, people die you know. </i>
all the time, in rodeos

161
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:30,447
<i>They die in NASCAR. All the time</i>

162
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:33,024
<i>But because this is a new sport</i>
 people don't know what it is

163
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:34,719
<i>And they see so much blood, </i>
they don't understand.

164
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,895
Blood is superficial. 
These guys has four ounce gloves on.

165
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:38,804
<i>They don't have 16 ounce gloves on.</i>
[Thud!]

166
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:40,374
<i>So there's no brain damage.</i>

167
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,136
<i>They're getting punched </i>
with a 4 ounce glove.

168
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:45,772
<i>If a guy in the ring is hurt, </i>
the referee will stop the fight.

169
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:47,311
<i>That won't happen in boxing.</i>

170
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:50,002
<i>His heirarchy has to be on the ground </i>
he can even be hurt.

171
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:52,284
<i>So as long as he can stand himself up</i>
<i>He could continue to fight.</i>

172
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:54,017
<i>And that doesn't happen in MMA either.</i>

173
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:59,619

that he was a former boxer.

174
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:03,608
<i>That he wrestled also, Pro, </i>
which I thought was insane.

182

And he's gonna fight one day. 
I will not be able to stop him.

183

<i>And comes back </i>
much better, much better.

186

There's a lot of skill involved.

187

It's not just some, you know, bar fight.

"I wanna fight" , "I wanna fight"
"I wanna fight"

190
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,356
Well, if you're not trained. 
You know we can't put you in there.

191
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,966
It's not safe.

192

But you still not gonna fight on my show.

193
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,686
A lot of these kids that call me up.

194
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,932
Wanting to fight, 
think they first have the ability.

195
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:01,944
Then they think it's just, it's easy. 
Let's go and do it

196
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:04,760
So, I as a 38,39 year old man

197
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,054
The first thing I do
is go to the gym and I'll spar 'em.

[swoosh] [ thud, thud]

Five guys walking off the street, 
I'm looking for one thing,

200
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,176
all of them wanna be 
world champion.

201
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:22,093
But the most important thing is, 
<i>Dedication</i>

-<i>[Tim] Don't commit to run.</i>

205
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:31,806
<i>Commit to the exchange.</i>
 You're committing to not getting hurt.

206
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:34,885
- <i>[Albert Stainback] Actually, quite </i>
afraid of being hit when I'm in the gym.

207
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:36,665
<i>It sucks! You know you feel it.</i>

208
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:41,564
<i>But when I'm fighting, I just wanna </i>
hit 'em and it just happens.

209
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:46,113
<i>And I hit them. And they fall </i>
unconscious and I feel good.

210
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:50,635
<i>The energy in the cage makes</i>
 the whole thing feel spiritual for me.

211
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:52,565
Like another world

212
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:54,934
It's almost like the universe 
is this big machine.

213
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,548
And I am, you know, I'm operating it.

214
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:58,850
I don't believe in God.

215
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,928
I don't believe in destiny.

216
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,222
I don't believe in predetermination 
or whatever anything like that.

217
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:09,058
But I will say I am dazzled 
by the way I look at my life,

218
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:12,387
the way it's turned out and the way it's 
just like interconnected with fighting

219
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:15,429
the way I feel it is.

220
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:19,650
It's the only thing that I really think 
I'm good at, if anything.

221
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,256
You know if you could say 
I'm good at anything, it would be that.

222
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:22,262
- <i>[Gil] Guy's got a lot of talent.</i>

223

<i>He's not a bad looking kid. </i>

224
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,848
<i>But I see potential in him </i>
outside of fighting.

225
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:29,102

put himself to anything.

<i>He can do anything, he wanted to do.</i>

227

- [Albert] I kinda wanted to be my 
only option.

228
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,889
Cause I love it that much.

229
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,603
Maybe that's a little fool hearted, 
but I don't care.

230
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:39,310
- [Gil] Many mistakes 
that a young fighter are making.

231
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,017
I guess, the most important one.

232
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:45,402
Is that they're forgetting. 
That there's life after fighting.

233
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:46,648
Pursuing that MMA dream.

234
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:48,276
You know I can't fault anybody for that.

235
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:52,120
Because I pursued my own dream. 
But I did work at the same time.

236
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,134
I went to college at the same time.

237
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:55,783
You don't understood 
the sheer dynamics of it.

238
00:12:55,783 --> 00:13:00,345
Most fighters 99% of fighters 
end up broken and destitute.

239
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:03,529
That's just the truth of it.

240
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,650
They might make a little bit of money 
here and there.

241
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,281
But most fighters, most people 
climbing into the ring or the cage

242
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:09,568
don't make a penny.

the best you can

So what can I do?

Is something very important for a fight.

And yes I do practice in the mirror

262

I'll sit in the mirror in the bathroom 
and just be like. [deep breathing]

263
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:17,641
If you're staring them down

And you see that certain look

265
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:22,640
I believed that you know, 
you're already in their head.

And that, and that helps.
You know.

267

But then you get those people, 
and this is when you know

268
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,026
It's gonna be a fight.

269

When they just look 
right back at you dude...

And it's a..
I like those even better actually.

00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:36,164
I like it when they grind,
you know, right back.

272
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:38,295
When they are not scared.

273

When they do not back down. I love it!

274

way when they get in the cage.

But other people in the outside
don't really notice it how,

how peaceful it really is inside there.

with Dinero Sports Marketing.

lose this fight?

That's putting pressure on me thinking
about that.

1076
01:03:59,532 --> 01:04:01,032
That's why, if I lose this fight,

1077
01:04:01,032 --> 01:04:02,243
is my manager gonna say,

1078

even tougher guys now."
