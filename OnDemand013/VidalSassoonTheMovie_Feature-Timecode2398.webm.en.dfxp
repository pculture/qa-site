      <p begin="00:27:59.159" end="00:28:02.682">She said, "Up on the stage"</p>
      <p begin="00:28:02.682" end="00:28:05.706">"You see something there<br/>that you can read on the podium?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06.116" end="00:28:08.469">I said, "Yes."</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08.469" end="00:28:10.709">She said, "Enunciate."</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.709" end="00:28:12.749">Just the one word.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:12.749" end="00:28:15.789">And there was something for me to read.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.789" end="00:28:17.125">So, I enunciated.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:17.125" end="00:28:23.929">And she said, "My God! It's bloody awful!<br/>But I think I can do something with you."</p>
      <p begin="00:28:23.929" end="00:28:28.452">So, for three years, when I was in town,<br/>wasn't out doing shows,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:28.452" end="00:28:32.865">I was going to Iris Warren.<br/>She was working on the vowels.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:32.865" end="00:28:35.469">And it does work, it does help.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.469" end="00:28:39.071">It wasn't just the production of voice.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:39.071" end="00:28:41.375">It was when to keep it low.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:41.375" end="00:28:46.073">When to bring the audience in<br/>and when to modulate your audio.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:46.073" end="00:28:47.665">It was totally fascinating.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:47.665" end="00:28:52.768">*It gave me the sense anyway<br/>that I could speak to a crowd of people</p>
      <p begin="00:28:52.768" end="00:28:55.211">and bring them in to what I was saying,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:55.211" end="00:28:56.840">and have them understand.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:28:59.860">And it proved incredibly valuable.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:59.860" end="00:29:05.292">Had I gone to college,<br/>I would have definitely been an Architect.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05.292" end="00:29:07.953">That would have been my dream,<br/>to be an Architect.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:07.953" end="00:29:10.581">Nineteen fifty-four,<br/>we worked in a very small salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:10.581" end="00:29:15.651">I was 26 then, and after two years,<br/>became far too small.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:15.651" end="00:29:18.348">It was a work-up<br/>on the third floor virtually.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.348" end="00:29:26.334">Then we moved to a much larger salon<br/>in Bond Street posh end as they say.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26.334" end="00:29:30.829">First, we did a white salon<br/>with a black boutique.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:30.829" end="00:29:34.954">And then later, we turned the whole salon<br/>into brown,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:34.954" end="00:29:36.954">with just steel bars in the front.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36.954" end="00:29:39.087">It looked like a hairdressing salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:39.087" end="00:29:41.385">It looked like a modern art gallery.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:41.385" end="00:29:44.433">&#9834; [music] &#9834;</p>
      <p begin="00:29:44.433" end="00:29:48.091">As we were changing everything,<br/>there's change of salons as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:48.091" end="00:29:50.162">So we changed the look of the salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:50.162" end="00:29:54.899">- There was his fabulous photographs on<br/>the wall as a collection of photographs.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54.899" end="00:29:58.156">The tables were very modern.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:58.156" end="00:29:59.166">Everything was modern.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:59.166" end="00:30:00.153">It was open.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.153" end="00:30:02.648">You could see from the street<br/>into the salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:02.648" end="00:30:05.546">Now in those days, that was very unusual.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:05.546" end="00:30:07.492">That people would actually be seen<br/>getting their hair done</p>
      <p begin="00:30:07.492" end="00:30:09.334">was a revolution.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:09.334" end="00:30:14.394">- And people were walking around<br/>with a sort of a [snapping fingers] buzz.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:14.394" end="00:30:15.776">A click.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:15.776" end="00:30:19.595">And, it sort of created<br/>a soar of excitement.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:19.595" end="00:30:23.117">- And there was a mezzanine floor<br/>with all these women standing.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:23.117" end="00:30:24.740">Hundreds of people in there.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:24.740" end="00:30:26.770">It was very difficult even to get<br/>to the receptionist</p>
      <p begin="00:30:26.770" end="00:30:29.294">because it was just<br/>so many people in the shop.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:29.294" end="00:30:31.084">- There was a hush in the salon.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:31.084" end="00:30:32.625">You hear the snapping of scissors.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:32.625" end="00:30:34.715">You hear -- not much chat going on.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:34.715" end="00:30:37.542">It wasn't like a heavy-gossipy place.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:37.542" end="00:30:39.645">It was like quite intense.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.645" end="00:30:43.332">-In this classy salon,<br/>boys fresh from Stretton in the suburbs,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:43.332" end="00:30:46.540">give their long-suffering customers<br/>not what they want</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46.540" end="00:30:49.580">but what Vidal Sassoon<br/>believes they should have.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:51.733" end="00:30:54.816">- You're not gonna cut my hair forward,<br/>are you?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:54.816" end="00:31:00.494">- [Vidal] Well, Lynda, when you came in,<br/>I noticed that your hair was combed back.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:00.494" end="00:31:02.359">- Yes, I like it combed back,<br/>it's more flattering.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:02.359" end="00:31:04.120">I'd rather it went back from there.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:04.120" end="00:31:05.827">- Why do you want it combed back?<br/>Give me one good reason.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:05.827" end="00:31:07.752">- Well, it gives me height up there.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07.752" end="00:31:08.894">- So, all your worrying<br/>about its height really.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:08.894" end="00:31:09.664">- Yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:09.664" end="00:31:12.768">- Not the fact that it goes<br/>back or forward but height.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:12.768" end="00:31:13.701">- It's what I've always had<br/>it going back there.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:13.701" end="00:31:15.717">- Ahh, we don't go what you've always had.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:15.717" end="00:31:17.875">Listen to me one moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:17.875" end="00:31:21.861">When you came in, because your hair<br/>was combed back and grows forward</p>
      <p begin="00:31:21.861" end="00:31:27.482">what you were getting here was a part,<br/>but it was an unintentional part.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27.482" end="00:31:33.492">My feeling is that if your hair<br/>is shaped the way it grows.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:33.492" end="00:31:37.751">Listen, [chuckling]<br/>if it's shaped the way it grows</p>
      <p begin="00:31:37.751" end="00:31:40.751">and you have your height put into it</p>
      <p begin="00:31:40.751" end="00:31:44.445">right across the hair,<br/>you are gonna get a much more defined</p>
      <p begin="00:31:44.445" end="00:31:45.645">and better shape.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45.645" end="00:31:47.908">You'll get all the height you need<br/>and the shape of the head</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47.908" end="00:31:49.674">will actually look better.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:49.674" end="00:31:50.773">Try this way.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50.773" end="00:31:51.763">- Alright.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:51.763" end="00:31:54.412">- What I need to do is cut it in a way.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:54.412" end="00:31:56.987">But if you feel you still don't like it,<br/>come back.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:56.987" end="00:31:58.114">You can take it back.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:58.114" end="00:32:00.983">- Vidal walked into the salon<br/>and will be working</p>
      <p begin="00:32:00.983" end="00:32:05.468">and there will be quite a buzz going on<br/>but, he'd walk in and suddenly</p>
      <p begin="00:32:05.468" end="00:32:12.525">there would be a bit of a hush until<br/>he goes, "First client in the chair."</p>
      <p begin="00:32:12.525" end="00:32:16.450">And his assistant was there<br/>with his scissors and his combs</p>
      <p begin="00:32:16.450" end="00:32:19.399">and then the tempo would<br/>pick back up again</p>
      <p begin="00:32:19.399" end="00:32:20.694">as he got going.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:20.694" end="00:32:21.739">Alright, he's in.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:21.739" end="00:32:22.597">He's settled.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:22.597" end="00:32:24.188">He's crimping. We're in.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:24.188" end="00:32:25.088">We're on again.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:25.088" end="00:32:27.463">- [Client] Do you always insist<br/>on giving people what you think is right</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27.463" end="00:32:30.118">rather than what they ask for?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:30.118" end="00:32:33.699">- Well, the work is technical,<br/>but on the other hand</p>
      <p begin="00:32:33.699" end="00:32:35.782">it is instinctive as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:35.782" end="00:32:38.924">And if your instincts tell you that<br/>what you're doing is wrong,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:38.924" end="00:32:41.857">then you mustn't do it because<br/>you're gonna make a bad job of it.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:41.857" end="00:32:44.429">I think that makes sense in anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:44.429" end="00:32:47.519">- [Client] It takes a long time to grow<br/>out, surely if somebody complains</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:49.093">you're really in trouble.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:49.093" end="00:32:54.044">- Uhmm, that's true, I mean, I think that<br/>people who are trying</p>
      <p begin="00:32:54.044" end="00:32:57.776">to do something a little different<br/>more often go out on a limb.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:57.796" end="00:33:00.740">If you're not trying to be safe<br/>all the time, on the other hand,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00.740" end="00:33:03.402">you're going to be more progressive<br/>and get more done.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:03.402" end="00:33:04.828">I think it works that way.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:04.828" end="00:33:09.726">- His creativity was at epic level.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:09.726" end="00:33:13.211">It was just -- everything he did,<br/>every section he thought</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.211" end="00:33:17.009">he was like a piece of art in motion.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:17.009" end="00:33:21.332">- It's like listening to music<br/>or you know having a great meal.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21.332" end="00:33:24.111">You know, you know, or seeing Vidal work.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:24.111" end="00:33:30.156">There was something magic about<br/>how Vidal was because he would dance.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:30.156" end="00:33:33.892">- Most people when they cut hair,<br/>they cut with this comb and scissors.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:33.892" end="00:33:36.296">Vidal cut with his whole body.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:36.296" end="00:33:37.741">- He would move.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37.741" end="00:33:39.993">He would sweat, he would make faces.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39.993" end="00:33:42.892">He would cut hair with snip, snip, snip!</p>
      <p begin="00:33:42.892" end="00:33:48.291">- Vidal was in his patent leather<br/>slippers, with his tight trousers.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:48.291" end="00:33:50.148">He was dancing around the chair.</p>

      <p begin="00:36:12.132" end="00:36:16.437">So he would pick the hair up<br/>[mocking Vidal].</p>
      <p begin="00:36:16.437" end="00:36:20.047">And he'd go over this haircut, and<br/>he'll say, "You've gotta get it right,"</p>

      <p begin="00:36:32.095" end="00:36:34.699">He has this kind of whispering thing.</p>

      <p begin="00:37:18.790" end="00:37:20.325">We took over the 2nd floor.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20.325" end="00:37:23.269">And I started to carve<br/>into this head of hair.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:23.269" end="00:37:27.793">And I saw by bringing<br/>the back up slightly.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:27.793" end="00:37:33.145">And keeping the length of the sides.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:33.145" end="00:37:34.674">Not four feet.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:34.674" end="00:37:36.953">But keeping length of the sides,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.953" end="00:37:41.681">You get a great angle from the side<br/>and she could shake it.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:41.681" end="00:37:43.041">It would fall in.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43.041" end="00:37:45.110">Well, she was petrified.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.110" end="00:37:50.341">She played chess with her manager<br/>while all this was -- she couldn't look.</p>

      <p begin="00:37:59.641" end="00:38:01.742">So Terry gets on the line.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:01.742" end="00:38:04.512">Terry, I think we got something.</p>

      <p begin="00:38:10.162" end="00:38:12.429">He said, "Yes."</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12.429" end="00:38:16.730">And the architectural sense<br/>of what we were doing,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:16.730" end="00:38:18.491">making a statement.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:18.491" end="00:38:20.578">That's what matters.</p>

      <p begin="00:38:22.378" end="00:38:24.783">And got it off perfectly.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:24.783" end="00:38:28.235">I mean that picture went to<br/>American Vogue, to English Vogue,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28.235" end="00:38:30.286">to Italian Vogue.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:30.286" end="00:38:32.561">It went first to all the Vogue's<br/>then the papers picked it up.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32.561" end="00:38:37.595">I knew then, we are on to something.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40.979" end="00:38:44.811">- [man talking] I think the five-point,<br/>It was part of the most famous haircut,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44.811" end="00:38:45.808">the most photographed.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:45.808" end="00:38:49.576">The model in the five-point haircut<br/>is Grace Coddington,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:49.576" end="00:38:53.085">who went on to become Creative Director<br/>at American Vogue,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:53.085" end="00:38:54.613">and has been for a long time.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54.613" end="00:38:57.920">- [Grace] At that time, I had hair<br/>a little bit longer than it is now.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:03.643">Vidal was like, super smooth<br/>and he had this gentle voice</p>
      <p begin="00:39:03.643" end="00:39:06.683">and-uhm-he sort of sat me down.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:06.683" end="00:39:10.701">And I guess he liked my hair<br/>because he started cutting it and...</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.701" end="00:39:14.008">Where there great joy for a moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:14.008" end="00:39:16.862">Especially, you know when the<br/>five-point cut really worked.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:16.862" end="00:39:21.153">And Clare Rendlesham gave it<br/>a whole middle of quaint in two- ages.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22.290" end="00:39:30.506">And -- those exciting moments but the lead<br/>up to it could be terribly frustrating.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.583" end="00:39:40.375">Five-point cut for me was the epitome<br/>of nine years of work that led up to it.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:40.375" end="00:39:49.692">It was the last cut of geometry<br/>that in essence covered the whole head</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49.692" end="00:39:55.903">because you have to create the points,<br/>here, depending on bone structure</p>
      <p begin="00:39:55.903" end="00:40:00.477">where it was on the individual character<br/>working on</p>
      <p begin="00:40:00.477" end="00:40:04.813">and you send the point in the back<br/>of the head and the two --</p>
      <p begin="00:40:04.813" end="00:40:06.946">so that you actually have five points.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06.946" end="00:40:12.301">- Then I remember feeling the back and<br/>feeling that you know it's cut right out</p>
      <p begin="00:40:12.301" end="00:40:14.915">into -- into the hairline.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:14.915" end="00:40:16.909">That was pretty revolutionary.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:16.909" end="00:40:20.842">And it's kinda finished and he said<br/>"Stand up, okay. Shake it.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:20.842" end="00:40:25.251">and it was shhhh...you know,<br/>and it was extraordinary.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:25.251" end="00:40:30.159">- The thing about it was,<br/>that the hair itself when it was brushed</p>
      <p begin="00:40:30.159" end="00:40:35.413">anyway or you put your fingers<br/>through it had to fall back perfectly.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35.413" end="00:40:40.784">Five-point cut was the essential<br/>geometric shape.</p>

      <p begin="00:40:53.406" end="00:40:56.392">And they're kinda of synonymous really<br/>with that moment.</p>

      <p begin="00:41:13.258" end="00:41:16.939">The interesting about Mary and Vidal<br/>was that they collaborated.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:16.939" end="00:41:19.860">She was walking down Bond Street and<br/>she happen to look at her little window</p>
