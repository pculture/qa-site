      <p>and in so many ways. I thought about,<br/>at one point in time,</p>
      <p>hanging myself from the flagpole,</p>
      <p>with a sign on me saying exactly<br/>what happened, to make him feel bad.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] I was going to overdose <br/>on pain medication</p>
      <p>and sleeping medication <br/>and hope that I would fall asleep</p>
      <p>and my body would just shut down,<br/>or do something.</p>
      <p>When I went to the doctor, <br/>I had been feeling sick,</p>
      <p>and dizzy and nauseated,<br/>and they took my urine</p>
      <p>and they told me <br/>that I was pregnant.</p>
      <p>And it was like, there's a life in there,</p>
      <p>and maybe her life <br/>will be better than mine,</p>
      <p>and I've got to make sure of that. <br/>So, she's very special.</p>
      <p>[Brigadier Wilma Vaught] Sometimes <br/>it takes a different kind of action</p>
      <p>to cause change to come, <br/>and sometimes that's a lawsuit.</p>
      <p>[Susan Burke] I grew up on military bases. <br/>My dad was career army.</p>
      <p>When I was a child, <br/>when we answered the phone,</p>
      <p>we would have to say,<br/>"Colonel Burke's quarters,"</p>
      <p>and because of that,</p>
      <p>I have the understanding of the<br/>level of control</p>
      <p>that perhaps most <br/>in the civilian life don't have.</p>
      <p>The Feres Doctrine<br/>is a judicial doctrine</p>
      <p>that was developed by<br/>the Supreme Court that says,</p>
      <p>although the United States <br/>is going to allow people</p>
      <p>that are hurt by the government,<br/>to sue, just as you could sue a company,</p>
      <p>congress could not possibly have meant<br/>to include the military in that.</p>
      <p>Now Congress did not actually say that,<br/>rather it's a judicial interpretation</p>
      <p>of what they must have meant. <br/>If you're in the military,</p>
      <p>you cannot sue for something <br/>that happens to you</p>
      <p>that's incident to your military service.</p>
      <p>If military doctors amputate the wrong limb,<br/>you're out of luck.</p>
      <p>You can not sue for that harm<br/>that's been done to you,</p>
      <p>so we filed a law suit in federal court<br/>on behalf of 16 men and women,</p>
      <p>seeking to bring<br/>former Secretary Rumsfeld</p>
      <p>and Secretary Gates to justice.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] I heard about the lawsuit <br/>and decided to become a part of it</p>
      <p>because I never wanted <br/>another woman</p>
      <p>to go through what I went through.</p>
      <p>[Susan Burke] The law suit alleges <br/>that they have overseen</p>
      <p>a system that has deprived the<br/>rape survivors their constitutional rights,</p>
      <p>specifically we alleged<br/>that they deprived them</p>
      <p>of their substance of due process, <br/>their procedural due process,</p>
      <p>equal protection<br/>and first amendment rights.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] It made me sick <br/>to see everybody's stories.</p>
      <p>How they kind of closely tie together.</p>
      <p>It's consistent, like what<br/>the military does to us.</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] All the things that they've <br/>put in place are all pretty much intended</p>
      <p>to help women deal<br/>with being raped better,</p>
      <p>that's what they're about.</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] I joined the military <br/>halfway through</p>
      <p>my senior year of high school, <br/>wanting to serve my country</p>
      <p>and do new things <br/>and challenge myself in a different way.</p>
      <p>I was in the army for about 7 or 8 years <br/>before anything happened to me.</p>
      <p>I was raped by another CID agent<br/>who was senior to me.</p>
      <p>I was contacted by an agent<br/>with Fort Riley CID,</p>
      <p>who said theywere investigating <br/>the suspect as a serial rapist</p>
      <p>who had raped several military <br/>law enforcement women.</p>
      <p>I thought, you know, there was <br/>no way he wouldn't be convicted.</p>
      <p>If I have a difficult time with anything,</p>
      <p>it's about the fact that I had <br/>an almost ten-year career</p>
      <p>that I was very invested in, and I <br/>gave it all up to report a sex offender</p>
      <p>who was not even put to justice<br/>or put on the registry,</p>
      <p>and he's probably doing <br/>the same thing right now.</p>
      <p>[Sarah Albertson] <br/>I had one female lieutenant</p>
      <p>pull me aside and tell me she had heard<br/>about her case</p>
      <p>and she thought she could talk to me <br/>from one female marine to another,</p>
      <p>and she said,<br/>"Well what he did, was capitalize</p>
      <p>on an opportunity <br/>that you presented him.</p>
      <p>That's not the same thing as rape,<br/>you need to know that.</p>
      <p>A month after it happened, they made me<br/>go on a hike with him,</p>
      <p>and I tried to make everyone <br/>advocate for me not to go</p>
      <p>because I just couldn't deal<br/>with seeing him,</p>
      <p>so their solution to that <br/>was to put him in front of me,</p>
      <p>so that I could see him the whole time, <br/>so that I could know where he was</p>
      <p>and know that he <br/>wasn't able to do anything</p>
      <p>because he was standing <br/>right in front of me.</p>
      <p>And I remember thinking the entire time<br/>we were up on the hills,</p>
      <p>up at Camp Pendleton,<br/>if only it was steeper,</p>
      <p>I would have jumped.</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] There's no way out of it, <br/>I mean if you think of it,</p>
      <p>the only way out of it <br/>is suicide or AWOL.</p>
      <p>Those are your only options.<br/>Suicide, AWOL or deal with it.</p>
      <p>[Regina Vasquez] Right now, <br/>I'm just barely appreciating</p>
      <p>learning how to appreciate <br/>being a woman again.</p>
      <p>That's 11 years, <br/>and I'm trying to have fun with it,</p>
      <p>not forcing myself to have fun. <br/>I'm trying really hard not to cry</p>
      <p>but it just pisses me off.</p>
      <p>Watching you girls having to go<br/>through what I have</p>
      <p>it makes me want to explode.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] Being here, me wanting to <br/>commit suicide, I'm not alone.</p>
      <p>Me being hit and raped, I'm not alone. <br/>Everything.</p>
      <p>The way that they treated me, the way <br/>that they made me feel, I'm not alone.</p>
      <p>And we have all of you guys, with all <br/>of your knowledge and everything</p>
      <p>you guys are going to stand right up, <br/>you know, that's awesome.</p>
      <p>That's all I'm saying.</p>
      <p>[Brigadier Wilma Vaught] I think the women<br/>who are coming forward</p>
      <p>in this law suit are very courageous,</p>
      <p>because they're putting their names<br/>out there for criticism</p>
      <p>they're putting their names out there <br/>in history</p>
      <p>as they were the ones who got raped,</p>
      <p>and that's not anything you want<br/>to go through life with.</p>
      <p>[Capt. Anu Bhagwati] Today I stand<br/>in solidarity</p>
      <p>with the courageous women and men<br/>who have served in our armed forces.</p>
      <p>The inspirational plaintiffs <br/>you see before you are a small handful</p>
      <p>of the tens of thousands <br/>of troops and veterans</p>
      <p>who have been sexually brutalized <br/>by their fellow service members</p>
      <p>while defending our nation. <br/>It is time to finally acknowledge</p>
      <p>that our military's judicial system<br/>is broken when it comes to these cases.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] My name is Kori Cioca</p>
      <p>and in my case, my command<br/>was unwilling to help me.</p>
      <p>I went for help many times with my<br/>petty officers and I was denied help,</p>
      <p>even with other men saying,<br/>"Please get her away from him.",</p>
      <p>and it was still allowed.</p>
      <p>[Sarah Albertson] My name is <br/>Sarah Albertson.</p>
      <p>People were telling me,<br/>"Don't go to the public because</p>
      <p>it will make the military look bad."</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] I really feel like it is<br/>my social responsibility</p>
      <p>to speak out about this issue, <br/>especially considering my</p>
      <p>investigative experience and especially <br/>because the military justice system</p>
      <p>allows so many offenders<br/>to escape justice.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] She's actually starting<br/>to play with her toys.</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] Imaginative playing.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] It's all the stuff<br/>that you teach them</p>
      <p>when they play, you know. <br/>It's really cool.</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] I miss my baby.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] I do, too.</p>
      <p>Thank you for having us.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Chellie Pingree] Sure.</p>
      <p>Thanks for being willing to fill me<br/>in a little bit on the experiences.</p>
      <p>[Regina Vazquez] My name is<br/>Regina Vazquez and I served honorably</p>
      <p>in the United States Marine Corps<br/>for four years.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] My name is Kori Cioca</p>
      <p>and I served in<br/>the United States Coast Guard.</p>
      <p>I was harassed <br/>and sexually assaulted.</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] I was administratively <br/>discharged with no benefits</p>
      <p>after nine and a half years of service.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Louise Slaughter] Women <br/>should not have to bear that burden.</p>
      <p>That is not part of what we should have <br/>to be doing to be doing our jobs.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Mike Turner] We're talking <br/>about criminal activity.</p>
      <p>We're talking about a vicious attack <br/>that is criminal. It is an assault.</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] Almost none of the cases <br/>made it to court&#8208;martial,</p>
      <p>and out of the ones that do, <br/>almost none of them result in conviction.</p>
      <p>[Loretta Sanchez] It seems to me <br/>all the times</p>
      <p>that I've looked at these things</p>
      <p>that the command is the one <br/>who has such so much discretion.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] I think the advocate<br/>should actually be civilians.</p>
      <p>Not ones that work in the military.</p>
      <p>I think we should have actual units,<br/>civilian units.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Jackie Speiere] It absolutely tears<br/>my inside to think</p>
      <p>that this has been going on <br/>as long as it's been going on</p>
      <p>and we've never addressed it.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Ted Poe]<br/>All people in the military must know,</p>
      <p>if you're a perpetrator of sexual assault</p>
      <p>against someone else in the military,<br/>we'll be to you.</p>
      <p>You're going to be held accountable.</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] As a CID agent, <br/>I found it tremendously frustrating</p>
      <p>when I would demonstrate that <br/>an offender had committed an offense,</p>
      <p>and taking it to a commander <br/>and having a commander</p>
      <p>being the deciding authority.</p>
      <p>You know, I don't think commanders <br/>are capable</p>
      <p>of making an objective decision.</p>
      <p>I do not think it should be in their hands.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Niki Tsongas] So you would suggest <br/>taking the discretion away from them?</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] Yes, absolutely.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Niki Tsongas] <br/>Congresswoman Davis and I</p>
      <p>are both on the <br/>armed services committee.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Susan Davis] There are <br/>a number of issues</p>
      <p>that you've raised <br/>that makes me want to go back</p>
      <p>and particularly take another look.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Loretta Sanchez] On an <br/>emotional basis,</p>
      <p>what happens after a crime like<br/>that has been committed</p>
      <p>is a difficult thing to go through,<br/>and don't think I don't know. I know.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Chellie Pingree] The fact <br/>that you're willing to tell us</p>
      <p>your stories first hand,<br/>makes it much easier for us to go back</p>
      <p>and to say you know these are policies<br/>we have to change.</p>
      <p>It's a big deal what you're doing.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] You rarely find people<br/>who stand up for us,</p>
      <p>and just thank you so much <br/>for everything that you do.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Ted Poe] Last year, <br/>the military received over 3,000 reports</p>
      <p>of sexual assault involving <br/>other members in the service.</p>
      <p>This week, 17 veterans are saying<br/>the military ignored their cases</p>
      <p>of sexual assault<br/>while they were on active duty.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Jackie Speiere] Today I'm going <br/>to talk about seaman Kori Cioca</p>
      <p>who served in the Coast Guard<br/>from August 2005 to June 2007.</p>
      <p>She now suffers from PTSD <br/>and an abnormal EEG</p>
      <p>due to nerve damage in her face.</p>
      <p>Cioca later told the press, <br/>"It's like they didn't care.</p>
      <p>It wasn't important, <br/>I wasn't important."</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] So, we're eating <br/>at Bob Evans'</p>
      <p>and I overhear a girl <br/>talking about getting ready</p>
      <p>to go into the military,<br/>so I go over there and try to talk to her.</p>
      <p>Has anybody told you what to<br/>watch for or anything?</p>
      <p>[Waitress] My boyfriend's in the navy.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] So, he knows <br/>how tough it is for women.</p>
      <p>[Waitress] Yeah, he's been in <br/>for a couple of months now.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] So, how does he feel <br/>about you joining?</p>
      <p>Like, isn't he scared that the men <br/>will do something?</p>
      <p>[Waitress] He's a little scared <br/>but he knows I can take care of myself.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] Oh I thought so too,<br/>so be careful.</p>
      <p>I definitely let her know that maybe<br/>she should reconsider college</p>
      <p>and getting a degree.<br/>It'll save her some of the trouble.</p>
      <p>I wish someone would have told me that.</p>
      <p>You try to take care okay? <br/>You can still back out.</p>
      <p>You can be a civilian worker.</p>
      <p>[Wairess] Yeah, thank you. <br/>I'm not signed yet.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] Okay, well, just be careful.</p>
      <p>[Maiette Wells] People always ask me, <br/>"Was it worth it going in?"</p>
      <p>The idea of it is honorable. <br/>Serving your country is great.</p>
      <p>There are good people in it,<br/>and then there are people</p>
      <p>who will end up ruining your life.</p>
      <p>[Lt. Ariana Klay] Just the other day,<br/>I saw a girl running along the road.</p>
      <p>She looked like she<br/>was about high school age.</p>
      <p>She was wearing a USMC T&#8208;shirt, <br/>and I thought that, if she joins,</p>
      <p>then she's going to have to accept rape <br/>and destruction of her life.</p>
      <p>I cannot in good faith, I cannot recommend<br/>anyone to join with the way</p>
      <p>the organization is set up now.<br/>I would not wish that on anyone.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Chellie Pingree] You can't ask<br/>women to serve</p>
      <p>and then say, "Oh by the way, if you get<br/>in one of these horrendous situations,</p>
      <p>we won't be there to back you up <br/>or to help you."</p>
      <p>[Rep. Loretta Sanchez] When I would do <br/>nominations for the air force academy,</p>
      <p>it was difficult to talk to parents <br/>and say,</p>
      <p>"Don't worry, she's not going to get raped."</p>
      <p>[Christina Jones] No. I would tell<br/>my daughter not to join the military.</p>
      <p>They have good things to offer <br/>but a rape is not one of them.</p>
      <p>[Miette Wells] Not in my lifetime. <br/>She's not joining, no.</p>
      <p>[Rob McDonald] I would be terrified <br/>if my daughter wanted to join the military.</p>
      <p>I would have a serious long talk <br/>and hope that the one thing</p>
      <p>is that's what she'd listen to.</p>
      <p>[Brigadier Gen. Loree Sutton]<br/>Losing even one soldier,</p>
      <p>needlessly, because of military sexual<br/>trauma, is one too many.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] I'm going to get the mail. <br/>Fingers crossed. Here's my fate.</p>
      <p>[Rob McDonald] What does it say?</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] Effective October 20th 2009. <br/>My overall combined rating is 70%.</p>
      <p>Wait. Service connection for anxiety<br/>is denied,</p>
      <p>service connection for disk placement</p>
      <p>and bilateral disk displacement<br/>is denied.</p>
      <p>Those motherfuckers, man. <br/>Oh, my god.</p>
      <p>My face doesn't have any disks in it, <br/>that's what the x&#8208;rays show.</p>
      <p>[Rob McDonald] How can you deny <br/>medical help when there's x&#8208;rays?</p>
      <p>If you do not agree with our decision <br/>you should write us and tell us why.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca]<br/>'Cause you're an asshole.</p>
      <p>[Rob McDonald] And you<br/>should identify specific issues.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] You're an idiot.</p>
      <p>[Rob McDonald] The evidence<br/>that was reviewed showed that</p>
      <p>you served whatever, which is less than <br/>minimum active duty requirements</p>
      <p>for disability pension.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't your choice.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] They're going <br/>to punish me for what they did,</p>
      <p>because I was short two months <br/>of two years. I know.</p>
      <p>I feel the same way, Shea.</p>
      <p>[Dr. Kaye Whitley] It's nice to see you again <br/>and thank you for coming.</p>
      <p>You have been provided highlights <br/>of the numbers of the report</p>
      <p>and I'm going to walk you<br/>through those slides,</p>
      <p>then I'm going to play a short <br/>public service announcement</p>
      <p>and then we can entertain questions.</p>
      <p>I think the prevention aspect <br/>of sexual assault</p>
      <p>goes back in some ways to risk reduction.</p>
      <p>*[Kirby] What is risk reduction? *</p>
      <p>[Dr. Kaye Whitley] Risk reductions <br/>are ideas like telling women to--</p>
      <p>if they're going to go somewhere, <br/>always have a buddy with them.</p>
      <p>*[Kirby] Are there other examples<br/>of risk reduction? *</p>
      <p>[Dr. Kaye Whitley] I'm not familiar, <br/>but that's out of my area of expertise.</p>
      <p>$$ August 1, 2011, <br/>Major General Mary Kay Hertog</p>
      <p>replaces Kaye Whitley as the Director <br/>of the Sexual Assault and Prevention Office. $$</p>
      <p>[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] Well,<br/>I want to continue where Dr. Whitley left off.</p>
      <p>Looking at where our focus is and that's <br/>on prevention as well as response,</p>
      <p>we've really done a very good job there <br/>and the credit goes to Dr. Whitley</p>
      <p>and her staff that has been working this <br/>the past five to years years.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Mike Turner] I don't think<br/>the Department of Defense</p>
      <p>has really yet embraced that they have<br/>a sexual assault problem</p>
      <p>that its not just an issue <br/>of a cultural environment</p>
      <p>or that the people at risk <br/>of sexual assault.</p>
      <p>The system itself does not value<br/>the rights of victims</p>
      <p>and doesn't provide them<br/>adequate protection.</p>
      <p>[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] You know, <br/>I have heard the accusations as well,</p>
      <p>that commanders are sweeping this <br/>under the carpet.</p>
      <p>Now, what I would say to the people <br/>that have come forward to you is that,</p>
      <p>if you feel that your commander is <br/>ignoring what you have asked them to do,</p>
      <p>if they are not taking care of you<br/>within that chain of command,</p>
      <p>you need to go to the DOD,</p>
      <p>the Department of Defense Inspector General.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Jackie Speier] The GAO, <br/>General Accounting Office,</p>
      <p>just did a study, a report and guess what,<br/>not one, not one case,</p>
      <p>of more than 2,500 has been reviewed</p>
      <p>and investigated<br/>by the inspector general,</p>
      <p>and when asked about that,<br/>the inspector general said,</p>
      <p>"Well, we have other higher priorities."</p>
      <p>[Susan Burke] What you really want<br/>is you want there to be a system akin</p>
      <p>to a civilian system <br/>where you go to the police</p>
      <p>and the crime is prosecuted <br/>by an impartial judicial system.</p>
      <p>[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] <br/>As a commander, you have no favorites.</p>
      <p>You are equally to take care <br/>of every single person</p>
      <p>in your organization.<br/>That's what command is all about.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Susan Burke] These are<br/>human beings just like everyone else.</p>
      <p>You cannot be impartial when you <br/>are involved with people in other settings.</p>
      <p>[Admiral Anthony Kurta] I would take <br/>exception with your characterization</p>
      <p>that the disposition of the case <br/>is based on the relationship</p>
      <p>between the commander<br/>and the alleged perpetrator.</p>
      <p>$$ 33% of female soldiers<br/>didn't report their rape</p>
      <p>because the person to report to <br/>was a friend of the rapist. $$</p>
      <p>[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] <br/>I'm going to speak to you</p>
      <p>with my former commander's hat on.</p>
      <p>There is absolutely <br/>no conflict of interest.</p>
      <p>You do what the right thing is to do.</p>
      <p>You have other avenues and if you feel like you <br/>have not been taken care adequately</p>
      <p>by your commander,<br/>go up through your congressman,</p>
      <p>or congresswoman, <br/>file a complaint that way.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Susan Burke] You can't go to your congressman<br/>to obtain justice for being raped,</p>
      <p>I mean, imagine how silly that is,<br/>imagine if you told civilians that,</p>
      <p>"Oh jeez, sorry you were raped, <br/>go talk to your congressman."</p>
      <p>$$ Many of our closest NATO allies <br/>no longer allow commanders</p>
      <p>to determine the prosecution <br/>of sexual assault cases. $$</p>
      <p>*[Amy] If you could say something <br/>to this guy,*</p>
      <p>what would you want to say to him?</p>
      <p>[Jessica Hinves] I don't know.<br/>I don't think it's affected his life at all.</p>
      <p>And people in my old squadron <br/>that I've talked to,</p>
      <p>they don't see an effect on him at all,<br/>and that hurts</p>
      <p>because it's a struggle every day <br/>and it's completely changed who I am.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] I'm really hoping he falls off <br/>a coast guard boat</p>
      <p>and they never find him.<br/>I'm really hoping for that.</p>
      <p>Or there's a poor mishap <br/>and got chopped up by the prop.</p>
      <p>[Rob McDonald] That would be great.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] That would be great.</p>
      <p>[Rob McDonald] That would be <br/>an exciting day.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] It would.<br/>I'd probably celebrate.</p>
      <p>[Trina McDonald] I hope this <br/>reaches them too, you know.</p>
      <p>I hope that somewhere<br/>someone sees my face,</p>
      <p>you know, wherever it is, and goes,</p>
      <p>"I know them.", <br/>and they're talking about me</p>
      <p>because they know what they did.</p>
      <p>And then all they'll have to mutter <br/>is to some friend that goes,</p>
      <p>"Hey weren't we stationed with her?"<br/>and then it can't be a secret anymore.</p>
      <p>So hopefully they have to deal with it too,</p>
      <p>you know, <br/>in some way shape or form.</p>
      <p>[Helen Benedict] Most rapists<br/>are repetitive criminals.</p>
      <p>It's a kind of crime<br/>that has an obsessive quality</p>
      <p>so people do it again and again.</p>
      <p>So the tragedy of that is<br/>that every one of these guys</p>
      <p>who gets off freely, will be doing it <br/>to other women, again and again,</p>
      <p>often for years and years and years.</p>
      <p>[Russell Strand] The average sex offender <br/>in their lifetime has about 300 victims,</p>
      <p>and the vast majority of sex offenders<br/>will never be caught.</p>
      <p>[Myla Haider] A lot of civilians see it <br/>as being a military problem,</p>
      <p>but it really isn't. Because 5% or less <br/>of reported offenders are convicted,</p>
      <p>so almost none of them wind up<br/>on the sex offender registry.</p>
      <p>[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] <br/>There is no military sex offender list</p>
      <p>that I'm aware of but, if you're convicted<br/>in court, a felony conviction</p>
      <p>of sex offense of a sex offense,<br/>you're going to go on the national list.</p>
      <p>*[Kirby] For any sex offense whatsoever? *</p>
      <p>[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] Correct.</p>
      <p>[Stace Nelson] That is not the case.<br/>It depends on what level conviction they got.</p>
      <p>If they received over a year,<br/>then that's considered a felony.</p>
      <p>But a lot of these cases are plead down, <br/>so that they're not felonies.</p>
      <p>The military doesn't like<br/>to prosecute people</p>
      <p>and keep them as felony convictions.</p>
      <p>[Russell Strand] I often ask myself <br/>the question, "Why would they stop?",</p>
      <p>and if there's nothing to stop them<br/>like incarceration,</p>
      <p>or some other major life change, <br/>they're going to continue.</p>
      <p>[Stace Nelson] If you run <br/>a sexual predator</p>
      <p>through the judicial system</p>
      <p>and then you slap him on <br/>the hand all you've done,</p>
      <p>is you've done the equivalent of the <br/>catch and release program.</p>
      <p>You've caught them, <br/>you've educated them,</p>
      <p>and now you've released them back<br/>into hometown America.</p>
      <p>He now knows a lot more<br/>about the law enforcement,</p>
      <p>the judicial system, than he did <br/>when he first started,</p>
      <p>which makes him a much more<br/>capable criminal,</p>
      <p>and a much more dangerous criminal.</p>
      <p>[Capt. Anu Bhagwati] They go on to<br/>literally prey on women and men</p>
      <p>in our neighborhoods<br/>across the United States.</p>
      <p>If we don't care about women and men <br/>in the military, then we should hopefully care</p>
      <p>about women and men, girls and boys<br/>in our neighborhood back home.</p>
      <p>$$ In December 2011, the Court dismissed<br/>the survivor's lawsuit ruling that rape is an</p>
      <p>occupational hazard of military service.<br/>An appeal has been filed. $$</p>
      <p>[Helen Benedict] The thing that broke <br/>my heart the most about this story,</p>
      <p>was the young women who went in <br/>with such idealism,</p>
      <p>I want to serve my country, <br/>I want to give back.</p>
      <p>To see a young person's hope and idealism <br/>crushed in that brutal way,</p>
      <p>I think we owe our young people<br/>more than that.</p>
      <p>[Rep. Chellie Pingree] Increasingly,<br/>women are becoming</p>
      <p>some of the best&#8208;trained officials<br/>that we have in the military.</p>
      <p>These are great soldiers <br/>and we can't afford to lose them.</p>
      <p>[Sara Albertson] Yeah, I'm happy<br/>I never have to wear that again.</p>
      <p>[Paula Coughlin] People deeply believe<br/>in their hearts to serve their country.</p>
      <p>They should be given that chance,<br/>with respect.</p>
      <p>You know, it's part of really <br/>our American way.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] Do you think we deserve<br/>a purple heart</p>
      <p>because we were wounded<br/>in a time of war?</p>
      <p>[Regina Vasquez] They're never going <br/>to give us one.</p>
      <p>[Kori Cioca] I know, but I'm just saying <br/>maybe there should be a ribbon</p>
      <p>for women who have survived it.</p>
      <p>[Dennis Laich] We have a good army,<br/>a good military, but not a great one</p>
      <p>and this is the kind of issue that keeps <br/>our military from being great.</p>
      <p>[Brigadier Gen. Loree Sutton] We can <br/>view this as a shared challenge.</p>
      <p>It's not just a woman's issue, <br/>it's not just something</p>
      <p>the military has to deal with,<br/>but it's society.</p>
      <p>We're all in this together. <br/>It's our national duty.</p>
