this virus or halt it in its tracks.

- You're just simply carrying the virus,
is that correct?

450
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:15,807
- I have a few very minor symptoms
and my immune system is virtually shot.

Dextran Sulfate legally, I'm taking it

--for I don't know anything

00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:28,077
about Dextran Sulfate, 
and neither do you--

456
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,416
- Well, I'll tell you this,
it's an over-the-counter drug in Japan

457
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:31,421
and has been for 20 years, 
over-the-counter.

458
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:33,534
- <i>[Pat] Over-the-counter in Japan? </i>
- Yes.

459
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:36,388
- [Tom] But if the FDA says--
- <i>[Pat] Mr. Staley--</i>

460
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:37,795
- I'm only asking 
that they be released after--

461
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:42,221
after there's a minimal amount 
of efficacy, not a 100% test.

462
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:46,062

the pink triangle on your shirt,

463
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:48,306
I gather that means you're a homosexual.

464
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,057
- Yes.

465
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,887
- <i>Looking in the camera,</i>
what would you tell some kids,

466
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:53,137
say, you had a younger brother,
twenty-one years old,

467
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:56,249
who also might have homosexual tendencies,

468
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:58,830
what would you tell him if you want him
to live a long life?

469
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,146
- Use a condom, and also to use
a lubricant, by the way,

470
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:04,057
that has the medicine--

471
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:06,357
- [Pat] And actually 
this is <i>Russian roulette.</i>

472
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:09,889
- It is not Russian roulette.
It is Russian roulette to not give people

473
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:14,130
this information when human nature
dictates that they're gonna go out there

474
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,137
and they're gonna have sex anywhere. 
- You mean celibacy is impossible?

475
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:18,329
- It's not just gonna work.
People aren’t gonna do it

00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:20,305
and lots of people are gonna die.

477
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:24,699
Now, would you rather have a lot of people
cheating under the celibacy

478
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:27,892
with thousands of people dying
or would you rather save those lives?

479
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:29,715
and let them have sex.

480
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:31,568

were all that great.

603
00:39:22,668 --> 00:39:25,385

- [Emilio] At Merck, HIV was an important
scientific target.

607
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,221
HIV of course is a virus.

608
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:49,997
In order for the virus to infect
an uninfected cell,

609
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:54,307
it needs to construct itself
in a particular way.

610
00:39:55,004 --> 00:39:59,876
<i>First, the viral RNA needs</i>
to transform itself into a DNA copy,

611
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:02,320
<i>in order to knit itself into</i>

612
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,320
<i>the nuclear DNA </i>
of the newly infected cell.

613
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,192
<i>This occurs via process called,</i>
reversed transcription.

614
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:15,088
<i>AZT and DDI were both</i>
originally developed to try to inhibit

615
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:18,313
<i>that process of establishing infection.</i>

616
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:21,869
<i>A number of other researchers</i>
began to focus on another portion

617
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,804
<i>of the viral life cycle,</i>
after the cell is already infected.

618
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:31,506
One of the steps that it takes is that
it makes a viral protein.

619
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:36,187
It has to snip that viral protein
in very specific places.

620
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:41,920
<i>The resulting pieces self-assemble</i>
to make the viral particle.

621
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,782
<i>And what does the snipping</i>
and what in fact controls the snipping,

622
00:40:45,782 --> 00:40:48,848
<i>is a viral protein called,</i>
the protease.

623
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:51,389
<i>If you genetically modified </i>
the viral protease,

624
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:53,089
<i>so that it can no longer snip--</i>

625
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:56,764
<i>The virus no longer has the ability</i>
to make those component pieces

626
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:58,696
<i>that it need to make in order</i>
to self-assemble

627
00:40:58,696 --> 00:41:01,605
<i>and make an infectious viral particle.</i>

628
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,206
- [Joseph] We solved the structure
of HIV protease

629
00:41:05,206 --> 00:41:08,924
in 1989, and published it pretty quickly.

630
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:13,437
I think we saw the structure and within
a few weeks, it was in the literature.

631
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,276
- And then the question became,
"Alright, can we prove it?

632
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:17,934
Can we prove it 
that that is in fact the case?

633
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,996
And most importantly, can we prove that

634
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:24,703
if you inhibit that protease,
if you knock out its activity,

635
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:29,192
that the virus can no longer replicate,
and therefore make new progeny

636
00:41:29,192 --> 00:41:31,563
viral particles that would
then go on and establish

637

00:47:58,646 --> 00:48:04,556
<i>but it's my understanding that </i>
thousands of people died from pneumonia

742
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:07,361
<i>because there was no priority </i>
within the government,

743
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:10,139
<i>or within the medical system as a whole,</i>

744
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:14,455
<i>to push the known preventive treatments</i>
for a long time.

745
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:17,476
<i>Now, those thousands of people are dead.</i>

746
00:48:17,476 --> 00:48:18,951
<i>It would seem to me that someone</i>

747
00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:24,138
who was within the government, 
while that took place as you work,

748
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:27,232
must have wrung your conscience 
of these deaths.

749
00:48:27,232 --> 00:48:29,512
- That is a tough one.

750
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:31,168
- No, it really is.

751
00:48:31,168 --> 00:48:34,956
It's inexcusable that 
an academic priority should ever,

752
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:38,157
ever come before the health of the people
that you're working with.

753
00:48:38,157 --> 00:48:41,958
<i>There's no questions about that,</i>
but the reality of the situation is,

754
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:49,569
there was a great reluctance
among the community of everything

755
00:48:49,569 --> 00:48:53,496
from the scientists to the congress
saying that

756
00:48:53,496 --> 00:48:58,980
what we should be doing
is not telling investigators what to do

757
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,236
but we should allow them to do
what they feel is the most important.

758
00:49:03,236 --> 00:49:04,385
Now, that sounds awful

759
00:49:04,385 --> 00:49:08,799
when you're putting into the context
of what we're talking about here.

760
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:11,241
But the whole world isn't in this room.

research priorities are defined.

773
00:49:51,062 --> 00:49:55,379

But the NIH is only testing old the drugs.

00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:56,744
Drugs that we already have.

- Hi! I'm Jimmy Johnson,

00:50:01,386 --> 00:50:05,772
And right now, I'm observing and

Why do you support this action?

stupidity, incompetence, and greed.

790
00:50:33,385 --> 00:50:36,451
Those are the three major driving force 
behind what's going on here,

791

and why there are no treatments

[THUMP!]

807
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:56,874
- If anything the mood after the NIH
was even bleaker than the mood before.

808
00:51:56,874 --> 00:51:58,330
Because we had no indication

809
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:01,830
that they were gonna change 
or respond to our demands.

810
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:05,391
And we had in fact had a meeting with them
in Bethesda, after the NIH action.

811
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:08,351
That indicated that there was
total resistance to putting people

812
00:52:08,351 --> 00:52:10,495
from the community 
on the research committees,

813
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:12,544
to let in the ACT UP observers 
attend the meetings,

814
00:52:12,544 --> 00:52:15,271
and to open up the meetings 
so that they weren't secret anymore.

815
00:52:15,395 --> 00:52:17,518
So why should Science
be shrowded in secrecy?

816
00:52:17,518 --> 00:52:20,429
It's supposed to be based on
a free exchange of ideas.

817
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:24,789
And so, it was very important
to stage in San Francisco,

818
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:28,241
before again the global community of
scientist and people working on AIDS,

819
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:32,812
why we had been at the NIH.
Why the U.S. systems wasn’t working out.

820
00:52:32,812 --> 00:52:34,825
And to reach the people directly

821
00:52:34,825 --> 00:52:38,225
that we had reached symbolically 
through the NIH action.

at the international AIDS conference

824
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:01,789
Hundreds more are angrily
protesting a government policy

825

<i>I will need a great deal of help</i>
from all of you.

Can we all, before it's too late,
begin to understand each other.

Will we realize that we share
similar motivations.

835
00:53:45,298 --> 00:53:48,876
During the upcoming days, 
ACT UP New York will be handing out

our AIDS treatment agenda,
which includes a list of 99 drugs

837
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,768

we are being constantly told to butt out.

840
00:54:06,671 --> 00:54:11,940
On my side, the level of anger
and frustration is reaching such a point

841
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,730
that attitudes claiming that all of you 
are uncaring and in it for greed

<i>the more people who were dying.</i>

1038

<i>Once a week we met,</i>

1039
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:31,421
<i>and at that meeting, a lot of people came </i>
who were just terrified

1040
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:34,518
<i>they weren’t gonna be alive</i>
even the next week.

1041
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:37,105
<i>What can we do?</i>
How can we get there?

1042
01:07:37,105 --> 01:07:39,718
- <i>[Jim] I think ACT UPs anger turned in</i>

1043
01:07:39,718 --> 01:07:43,681
<i>after having been directed out so long. </i>

1044
01:07:43,681 --> 01:07:48,046
- <i>In it's first few years,</i>
Treatment and Data pretty much

1045
01:07:48,262 --> 01:07:52,561
<i>got everything it wanted</i>
from the floor of ACT UP.

1046
01:07:52,561 --> 01:07:58,097
<i>But as Treatment and Data was becoming</i>
more and more technical,

1047
01:07:58,097 --> 01:08:02,120
<i>there were a lot of people in the</i>
general membership of ACT UP

1048
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:07,960
They saw that as an elite and that
maybe it would be better if

1049
01:08:08,941 --> 01:08:11,632
that elite was pulled in a bit.

1050
01:08:12,073 --> 01:08:18,035
- There was a fear I think that we were
getting too close to the people in power.

1051
01:08:18,035 --> 01:08:21,417
That we would compromise 
our own principles

1052
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:23,618
and the people who were more interested

1053
01:08:23,618 --> 01:08:27,240
in the social issues became
uncomfortable with that.

1054
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:32,542
- I remember this very decisive moment 
where there was a proposal for moratorium

1055
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:37,038
on meeting with drug companies 
for six months.

1056
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,011
And there was a huge and impassioned
debate over and someone said,

1057
01:08:41,011 --> 01:08:44,413
a woman, who is not HIV-positive said,

1058
01:08:44,413 --> 01:08:47,029
"Well, it's not like 
it's the rest of your life."

1059
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:51,705
And for a lot of people in the room,
it was the rest of their lives.

01:08:51,705 --> 01:08:54,495
[crowd chanting]

1061

- <i>There were inevitable splits </i>
in priorities.

1062
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:00,085
- You know it quite well.
- <i>[male voice] I know. </i>

1063
01:09:00,085 --> 01:09:03,816
- And it was completely left out of the
NIH research agenda.

1064
01:09:03,816 --> 01:09:06,451
- <i>[male voice] I agree. </i>

1065
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:11,270
- <i>I remember a lot of dirty tricks</i>
that happened and a lot of fear

1066
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:16,055
<i>within the organization that various</i>
factions had done this to each other.

1067
01:09:16,055 --> 01:09:20,862
- Mark Harrington. Mark Harrington.
There's a video camera in here now.

1068
01:09:20,862 --> 01:09:22,906
Would you like to take an oath

1069
01:09:22,906 --> 01:09:25,366
that you will not write nasty 
anonymous letters to people?

1070
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:29,057
- I've been getting some
hate letters too, but those are unsigned.

1071
01:09:29,057 --> 01:09:30,479
I don't ever-- I don't ever--

1072
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,880
- <i>So you keep on writing </i>
nasty letters to people?

1073
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,488
- There were a lot of charges in the midst
of that of sabotage and threats.

1074
01:09:38,488 --> 01:09:41,890
- [David Barr] Our last speaker 
is Larry Kramer.

1075
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:45,321
- <i>[male voice] Why don’t you answer</i>
the charges?

1076
01:09:45,321 --> 01:09:47,617

the chance to speak, alright?

1077
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:49,042

1080

- <i>[Bill] You can't just lick his ass </i>
before he talks!

1081
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,263
- <i>[male voice] Shut the fuck up </i>
and let him answer.

1082
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,447
- Look! There are a lot of people 
in the audience,

1083
01:10:03,447 --> 01:10:05,103
who wanna ask and talk about treatment.

1084
01:10:05,103 --> 01:10:08,870
And I think it's important that
you allow that to happen.

1085
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,289
-<i>[Bill] Oh, are you gonna take away </i>
free speech now?

1086

1088

the same point George Bush --

1089
01:10:19,441 --> 01:10:23,908
- PLAGUE! We are in the middle of a
fucking plague!

1090
01:10:23,908 --> 01:10:26,621
and you behave like this!

PLAGUE!

Forty million infected people
is a fucking plague!

1093

We are in the worst shape
we have ever, ever, ever been in!

1094
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:57,130
All those pills we're shoveling down
our throats! Forget it!

1095
01:10:58,109 --> 01:11:01,180
ACT UP has been taken over 
by a lunatic fringe

1096
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:03,833
that can't get together!
Nobody agrees with anything!

1097
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:07,912
All we can do is field a couple of hundred
people at a demonstration!

1098
01:11:07,912 --> 01:11:12,364
That's not gonna make anybody
pay attention!

1099
01:11:12,364 --> 01:11:15,190
Not until we get millions out there!

1100
01:11:16,407 --> 01:11:19,832
We can't do that!
All we do is pick at each other,

1101
01:11:19,832 --> 01:11:24,418
and yell at each other!
And I say to you, in year 10,

1102
01:11:24,818 --> 01:11:31,931
the same thing I said to you in 1981
when there were 41 cases.

1103
01:11:33,298 --> 01:11:41,278
Until we get our acts together,
all of us--we are as good as dead.

1104
01:11:45,256 --> 01:11:47,675
- <i>In the end,</i>
the Treatment and Data guys,

1105
01:11:47,675 --> 01:11:51,171
<i>Peter, Garance, Mark</i>
and some others split off

1106

<i>and formed their own</i>
separate organization.

1107
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,040
- <i>TAG was one of the little</i>
mercury balls that flew off

1108
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:04,588
the main body of ACT UP, a more
think tank-typed project came about.

1109
01:12:05,424 --> 01:12:09,655
- <i>Mr. Harrington, a TAG member,</i>
educated at the Harvard College.

1110
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:13,651
<i>And he has worked for a long time</i>
on experimental treatments

1111
01:12:13,651 --> 01:12:16,647
<i>for the disease</i>
and also the basic science

1112
01:12:16,647 --> 01:12:20,872
and Mr. Gonsalvez was born
in Long Island

1113
01:12:20,872 --> 01:12:24,632
and attended Tufts University,
also a TAG member.

1114
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:30,560
I guess I can do nothing better than to
turn this conference over to my speakers.

1115
01:12:30,776 --> 01:12:35,740
- <i>I noticed that you're both sitting</i>
up there in suits and ties.

1116
01:12:35,755 --> 01:12:40,873
<i>Do you feel that your approach</i>
is better than circling

1117
01:12:40,873 --> 01:12:44,405
<i>NIH buildings and so forth?</i>

1118
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:50,673
- I think that we like to keep our options
open, but it's silly to risk arrest

1119
01:12:50,673 --> 01:12:54,433
and the hassles that are tended upon
and if you can get serious attention

1120
01:12:54,433 --> 01:12:57,327
and negotiations going
with other measures.

1121
01:12:58,306 --> 01:13:02,159
- We've just released a report,
a critique of all the NIH's AIDS programs.

1122
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:05,919
- The research is spread out over
12 agencies. There's no coordination.

1123
01:13:05,919 --> 01:13:09,254
There's a lot of duplications.
There's no leadership.

1124
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:11,843
- The budget is shrinking and shrinking
as cases mount

1125
01:13:11,843 --> 01:13:14,819
and the President needs to be blamed
as well as the Congress.

1126
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:18,356
Who cut the entire NIH budget
by 150 million two weeks ago.

1127
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:21,892
- Our recommendations, I think,
are gonna require some legislation

1128
01:13:21,892 --> 01:13:25,608
and so we have to go 
to our friends on the hill

1129
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:29,385
and see what wonders 
they could work for us.

1131
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:43,092
- We had this one particular compound that
looked like it may have had the potency

1132
01:13:43,092 --> 01:13:46,173
and the physical properties 
that we wanted,

1133
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:48,173
and it could be a possible drug.

1134
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,637
- He said, "You know, let's put this in
HIV-infected individuals

1135
01:13:50,637 --> 01:13:52,794
and let's see what happens".

1136
01:13:52,794 --> 01:13:56,337
<i>So we went into a HIV-infected individuals</i>
with this drug called Crixivan.

1137
01:13:56,337 --> 01:13:58,939
<i>And you could see </i>
a very substantial drug.

1138
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:00,501
<i>Just with one protease inhibitor,</i>

1139
01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:02,501
<i>you could see very substantial </i>
drop in virus load.

1140
01:14:02,501 --> 01:14:05,501
So that was the first week. 
The second week was very disappointing.

1141
01:14:05,501 --> 01:14:08,346
Because what we saw
in the second week was in fact,

1142
01:14:08,346 --> 01:14:11,303
virus load coming right back up again.

1143
01:14:11,303 --> 01:14:12,603
One exception...

1144
01:14:12,603 --> 01:14:18,909
- There was one patient that--
patient #143, I believe, was his number,

1145
01:14:19,202 --> 01:14:22,093
that the virus went down
and stayed down.

1146
01:14:22,093 --> 01:14:24,272
- That told us that it was possible.

1147
01:14:24,614 --> 01:14:26,780
If it can happen in one, 
then by definition,

1148
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:30,961
it can happen in everyone. You just need 
to figure out how to do it.

1149
01:14:30,961 --> 01:14:32,634
That puts you 
in a completely different place,

1150
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,025
and in a completely different 
state of mind.

1151
01:14:35,025 --> 01:14:36,332
So then the question became,

1152
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:39,993
"Okay, now what do we need to do
in order to make it possible?"

01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:23,539
Dr. Kessler, how excited should we get
about this new family of drugs,

1326
01:31:23,539 --> 01:31:25,408
these protease inhibitors?

1327
01:31:25,408 --> 01:31:29,497
- I don't wanna over-promise,
but these are the most potent drugs

1328
01:31:29,497 --> 01:31:32,287
we've seen against the virus.

1329
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:36,178
- I know that you are pushing
for faster FDA approval of these drugs,

1330
01:31:36,178 --> 01:31:39,310
I know that the application has just gone
for the first of these drugs to the FDA,

1331
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:40,594
it's still gonna take six months.

1332
01:31:40,594 --> 01:31:44,789
- We will turn around that application
as quick as ever.

1333
01:31:44,789 --> 01:31:47,725
We are proving drugs
in a matter of months these days.

1334
01:31:47,725 --> 01:31:49,729
- But you were telling me, 
that's six months, right?

1335
01:31:49,729 --> 01:31:51,129
That's as quick as possible.

1336
01:31:51,129 --> 01:31:53,273
- We may be able to do it
even a little quicker.

1337
01:31:53,273 --> 01:31:56,659
- <i>[newsman] A split has developed between </i>
those who want rapid approval

1338
01:31:56,659 --> 01:32:01,390
<i>based on early indicators of success,</i>
and the Treatment Action Group, or TAG.

1339
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:05,868
<i>TAG has asked the FDA to reconsider</i>
the accelerated approval process.

1340
01:32:06,022 --> 01:32:07,342
- <i>[Peter] We we told the FDA,</i>

1341
01:32:07,342 --> 01:32:11,455
<i>"No, the company has asked you</i>
to approve that drug too soon.

1342
01:32:11,455 --> 01:32:13,831
<i>They need a little bit more data first.</i>

1343
01:32:14,047 --> 01:32:18,011
- <i>[newsman] TAG is asking the FDA </i>
to take a closer look at Saquinavir,

1344
01:32:18,011 --> 01:32:21,215
<i>the first protease inhibitor</i>
to seek approval.

1345
01:32:21,215 --> 01:32:25,176
- <i>We need to make sure we don't repeat</i>
the mistake we made with AZT and DDI.

1346
01:32:25,176 --> 01:32:28,450
<i>This is a new class of drugs.</i>
We need to know if it works.

1347
01:32:29,726 --> 01:32:35,256
- <i>The battle over early approval</i>
of Saquinavir was a really pivotal moment

1348
01:32:35,256 --> 01:32:40,964
<i>for treatment activism and we took</i>
such shit for it from within.

1349
01:32:40,964 --> 01:32:43,787
- There are a lot of people who do agree
that there are problems,

1350
01:32:43,787 --> 01:32:47,465
series of problems the way drug testing
and drug trials are run.

1351
01:32:47,465 --> 01:32:50,446
But there are many of us who feel that
halting--

1352
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:55,585
accelerated approval is not necessarily
the answer.

1353
01:32:55,585 --> 01:32:58,355
- <i>[Bill] Tenet made their proposal</i>
for this large simple trial

1354
01:32:58,355 --> 01:33:03,419
of 18,000 people that they wanna put
in a placebo-controlled trial,

1355
01:33:03,419 --> 01:33:05,881
where one-third will get placebo.

1356
01:33:05,881 --> 01:33:09,297
They pushed this idea on the FDA
at a secret meeting,

1357
01:33:09,297 --> 01:33:11,453
which was not announced to the community.

1358
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:14,474
<i>This is something we have fought</i>
hard and long for.

1359
01:33:14,474 --> 01:33:18,230
We've been arrested to get
accelerated approval through.

1360
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:20,253
- It's the behavior that
I have a problem with.

1361
01:33:20,253 --> 01:33:23,113
It's the work they're doing
that I have a problem with,

1362
01:33:23,113 --> 01:33:25,192
and this is what I am gonna fight.

1363
01:33:25,192 --> 01:33:27,692
I'm not interested 
in mud wrestling with the boys.

1364
01:33:27,692 --> 01:33:29,819
I am absolutely enraged 
that there are people

1365
01:33:29,819 --> 01:33:32,819
who have appointed themselves
a elitist representatives,

1366
01:33:32,819 --> 01:33:36,621
and represent themselves 
as a single voice of this epidemic.

1367
01:33:36,621 --> 01:33:39,223
I am gonna fight them.
My patients are gonna fight them.

1368
01:33:39,223 --> 01:33:42,235
And you God damn will go fight them!

1369
01:33:48,197 --> 01:33:50,615
- Currently, there's this big discussion
on accelerated approval

1370
01:33:50,615 --> 01:33:53,388
and last week on the floor.____

1371
01:33:53,388 --> 01:33:56,857
So we just wanted to give you
sort of the TAG perspective

1372
01:33:56,857 --> 01:33:59,775
and give you a sense of our proposal
around pre-AIDS drug development

1373
01:33:59,775 --> 01:34:03,350
so we can start from a baseline 
common understanding and knowledge.

1374
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:06,542
this proposal is not about taking
expanded access away,

1375
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:09,793
taking accelerated approval away.
This is about adding something.

1376
01:34:09,793 --> 01:34:11,512
This is about figuring out 
how do we get

1377
01:34:11,512 --> 01:34:14,012
information about how to actually 
use these drugs.

1378
01:34:14,012 --> 01:34:17,402
We need more people when you have
a less powerful drug.

1379
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:21,084
If we give them the penicillin
we could do it to 20 people.

1380
01:34:21,084 --> 01:34:24,022
So we put together a large
simple trial that tried to synthesize

1381
01:34:24,022 --> 01:34:26,695
expanded access in large simple trial.

1382
01:34:26,695 --> 01:34:31,458
And what we did is we presented it 
to Merck. We presented it to the FDA.

1383
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:34,309
We wanted to start a community discussion.

1384
01:34:34,309 --> 01:34:38,756
- I just wanted to thank Greg and Derek
for coming to tell us about this.

1385
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:40,317
[applause]

1386
01:34:40,317 --> 01:34:44,219
- because we hadn’t heard anything
until we read about it in Barrons.

1387
01:34:44,219 --> 01:34:46,763
- If you wanted to hear the proposal
you could have heard it 40 times.

1388
01:34:46,763 --> 01:34:48,385
<i>It's been talked about all over. </i>

1389
01:34:48,401 --> 01:34:50,354
- <i>Dr. Conley wants to speak. </i>

1390
01:34:50,354 --> 01:34:52,949
- TAG is talking about getting
accurate information.

1391
01:34:52,949 --> 01:34:55,692
ACT UP is talking 
about making drug available.

1392
01:34:55,692 --> 01:34:57,185
There should be a way to mesh those two.

1393
01:34:57,185 --> 01:35:00,217
It's really not one or the other.
These two groups are really

1394
01:35:00,217 --> 01:35:02,117
talking pass one another.

1395
01:35:02,117 --> 01:35:05,143
Try not to scream, try not to go for
each other's throats.

1396
01:35:05,143 --> 01:35:08,948
But just talk, because the difference is
really can be breached.

- They elevated themselves by their own
self education about these things.

And then it became very, very clear that
you weren’t gonna mess with these people

because they knew exactly
what you were talking

and you weren’t cut in corners.

was combination therapy.

with Crixivan plus AZT plus 3TC.

1426

- The activist proposed a study design,
the industry used it,

1427
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,872
it got the drug approved in six months.

1428

it was like, 
"We did it! We did something."

- It was too much to take it 
at that point.

1438
01:38:39,728 --> 01:38:41,685
It wasn’t until we started 
putting the drugs

1439
01:38:41,685 --> 01:38:46,358
in our bodies. And we all went home 
and started--

1440
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:50,128
went straight on that regimen
that had been on that slide,

1441

including Crixivan 
and two nucleoside analogues.

triple-drug combination.

<i>and if you need your clinical trial,</i>
you could just go to these hospitals

<i>that were not filling up the way</i>
they were filling up with people with HIV.

melting back into their skin.

1450

that was a phenomenal feeling.

- It worked.
You know, we did something remarkable.

1455
01:39:37,015 --> 01:39:43,188
- So that breakthrough that we thought
was gonna happen in '88 or'89

1456
01:39:43,204 --> 01:39:46,809
if we just work fast enough.
You know, it did happen...

1457
01:39:50,883 --> 01:39:56,258
but not until '96 and so...
you know, a lot of people died,

And there's probably

01:40:19,518 --> 01:40:22,518
a lot of complicated reasons why

1463
01:40:22,518 --> 01:40:27,630
but I still find it very difficult
to plan for the future and/or accept

1464
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:33,868
that I will have long life, 
which is unfortunate

1465
01:40:33,868 --> 01:40:36,868
because I've had a long life

1466
01:40:36,868 --> 01:40:40,334
and I've been living with AIDS 
for 20 years.

1467
01:40:41,241 --> 01:40:44,484
But it's hard for me to relax into life.

1468
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:51,921
- I know lots of us went through really
difficult times after--

01:40:54,258 --> 01:40:57,784
trying to figure out what do I do now?
