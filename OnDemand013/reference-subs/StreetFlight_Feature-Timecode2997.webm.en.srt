*He apologizes and says*
*he'll talk to the Mayor.*

307
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,579
*But my followup phone calls*
*and faxes go unanswered.*

308
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:11,791
*And I soon discover*

309
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,625
*that I'm not the only one having trouble
for spending too much time*

310
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,142
*with Cory Booker.*

311
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:17,651
- *[Jimmy Mitchell] I opened this place up 
in '97.*

312
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:22,200
I never had any problem until 
Cory Booker came to my house one night.

313
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,678
He wanted the people in the community
to get to know him, that didn't know him.

314
00:13:26,678 --> 00:13:31,218
So, I suggested, I have a coffee klatsch
at my house,

315
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:33,343
invite 15 or 20 people over.

316
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:39,619
So I had one, one Sunday night.
Like I said, that Monday, police came,

317
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,162
said that I wasn't legal.

318
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:44,057
And they closed my business down.

319
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,897
-You can go to any place in the City,

320
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:47,461
and you can find a violation.

321
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:50,329
- *[narrator] Pablo Fonseca 
used to be the Head of Code Enforcement *

322
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,534
*for the City of Newark.*

323
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:55,034
- If you're in this city,
you have be very careful.

324
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,544
you know, if you take on Sharpe James.

325
00:13:58,544 --> 00:14:01,476
You know, everything is at his power.

326
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:02,444
It's at his behest.

327
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,726
He can make your life impossible.

328
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:07,614
[speaking foreign language]

329
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,387
- *[narrator] He was also Sharpe James' 
campaign manager*

330
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:12,151
*in the Latino community.*

331
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,060
- [Pablo] Two years ago, 
I supported a candidate

332
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,824
Sharpe James did not like
and did not back.

333
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,365
And even though I was protected
by civil service,

334
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:23,360
he brought me up on charges
and demoted me.

335
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,791
From supervising a four million dollar budget,

336
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,234
to supervising to people
in a sanitation garage.

337
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,341
That's a reality check on politics.

338
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:33,775
That's politics 101.

339
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:35,914
And it was, you know,

340
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:38,747
"WOW! What the hell!"

341
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:44,123
I sued the administration and won. 
And I joined the Booker team.

342
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:48,123
- *[narrator] Jimmy Mitchell joined*
*the Booker campaign too.*

343
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:49,623
*As Cory's driver.*

344
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,458
*But for most people,*
*their businesses come first.*

345
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,561
- They sent Code Enforcement
down to Bergen street

346
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,630
*to basically threaten folks and they say,*

347
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,872
"If you put up a Cory Booker sign,
you'll facing consequences."

348
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:03,342
And having Code Enforcement
deliver that message,

349
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:06,840
you know, it's pretty persuasive.

350
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,374
- *[narrator] Over the next few weeks,*

351
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,134
*I meet a policeman
who's support for Booker*

352
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:11,944
*got him transferred to night patrol*

353
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,048
*in a dangerous neighborhood.*

354
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,817
*A minister who's church was threatened*
*by Code Enforcement,*

355
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,887
*after he criticized the Mayor.*

356
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,727
*A woman who fears she'll lose*
*her public housing,*

357
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:24,060
*if she hangs a Booker sign
in her window.*

358
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,195
- People have children.

359
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:27,627
People have houses and mortgages,

360
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,736
and rent to pay, and food to buy.

361
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:34,534
Why are you firing somebody
because they don't wanna vote for you?

362
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,381
That's their God-given right.

363
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:39,763
They're born in America,

364
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:42,654
you have the right to vote
for who you want to.

365
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,103
That's what it's all about.

366
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:46,078
And when you take that from somebody,

367
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,710
and the Lord doesn't stand up for it
and do something about it,

368
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,690
there's something seriously wrong.

369
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,595
- [Pablo] Just found this schedule,
like tonight's fundraiser,

370
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:56,565
it shouldn't have Jimmy Wright's
name on it.

371
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,979
Because if somebody picks this up,

372
00:15:57,979 --> 00:15:58,923
God,

373
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:02,867
*Jimmy Wright's ass is gonna be at 
cell block, 24 hours a day.*

374
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,071
- *[male voice] Right.*
- *[Pablo] These are like people*

375
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,501
*who are putting a lot on the line for us.*

376
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:11,734
That if Sharpe has any idea,
you know, he will crush these people.

377
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,410
[beep, beep, beep]

378
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,744
- Drug dealers don't own this city.

379
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:19,913
We do.

380
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:23,752
- I don't like that. 
"Drug dealers don't own this city, we do."

381
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:25,871
-Drug dealers don't own this city.
We do.

382
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:28,459
- *[narrator] The polls show 
that Cory's biggest challenge*

383
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:29,640
*is name recognition.*

384
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:34,585
*So he's outside his building,*
*trying to create a Booker brand.*

385
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:38,568
- [Hiver] I thought we're just bringing
a camcorder out.

386
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,630
-*[Cory] JUNIOR!*

387
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,591
-*[Junior] What do you want?*

388
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:44,431
- [Cory] Can I have 
a cup of coffee, Junior?

389
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:49,113
- What you guys want?
I just woke up--another day.

390
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:51,451
- Okay. We got a shot here, Junior.
Tell me how I do.

391
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,346
-*[male voice] ACTION!*

392
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:57,550
-I'm Cory Booker. It's time that we put--

393
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,552
Ahhh!

394
00:16:58,552 --> 00:16:59,309
I apologize.

395
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,626
-*[female] It's alright. 
We'll take two.*

396
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,291
I apologize.

397
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,292
I'm Cory Booker. And I'm--

398
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:09,133
- [female] Okay. Here we go!
Quiet please!

399
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:15,834
[campaigning female voice playing on TV]

400
00:17:18,928 --> 00:17:21,499
- *[narrator] Sharpe James 
is pushing his story as well.*

401
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:25,111
*He grew up in Newark,*

402
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,649
*served in the army,*

403
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:28,621
*and taught gym at a local high school.*

404
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:33,318
*In 1970, at the age of 34,*
*he was elected to the City Council.*

405
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:37,524
*He served 16 years*
*and then running as a reformer.*

406
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,165
*He was elected mayor.*

407
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,868
*But in the 90's,
corruption scandals plagued his office.*

408
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,366
*Taking down his closest Aides
including his Chief of Police.*

409
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,778
*and his Chief of Staff, who was caught
with bags of money under the floorboards.*

410
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,572
*Sharpe weathered the storm though,*

411
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,680
*he was funny and an energetic booster
for the city.*

412
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,578
*New building went up in the downtown.*

413
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:01,417
*A performing arts center,*

414
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:02,987
*a minor league baseball stadium.*

415
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:08,956
*And Sharpe James gained a reputation*
*for creating a renaissance in Newark.*

[crowd cheering]

424
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:30,229
- *[Sharpe] This is a great day for Newark.*

425
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,456
We heard cheers when it came down.

426
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,915
Because what will go up 
will be part of a new Newark.

427
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,256
And a new America.

428
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:39,456
*And new dreams and new hopes.*

429
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,223
- What the city is doing 
is destroying home for low-income people,

430
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:47,426
and displacing them and not providing
places for them to live.

431
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,234
In the last 10 years,
10,200 homes have been destroyed,

432
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:55,538
and only 2500 homes have been replaced.

433
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,810
- [female] Cory Booker does not have
a vested interest in this city.

434
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,445
He doesn't own anything.

435
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:01,440
He's a Johnny-Come-Lately.

436
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:05,887
He doesn't understand the politics 
of this town.

437
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:10,417
And just because you come in
and some golden boy,

438
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:14,188
and you happen to get lucky
and win one election,

439
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:17,289
does not mean that you've got a handle
on what's going on.

440
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:20,726
People that live here
and have a vested interest in our city

441
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,229
know that Sharpe James is doing
a great job for this city.

442
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,868
-Sharpe James is trying to get credit
for something that he ain't even do,

443
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:27,996
he ain't nothing.

444
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:28,703
You know what I'm saying?

445
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:30,135
If he was right here?
I'll tell him in his face.

446
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:34,606
-Okay. Just don't blame this on Sharpe
because I know what's already here.

447
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,775
I don't know what I'm getting
if Booker gets in.

448
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,752
- Why you wanna blame it on Sharpe?
Cory's a councilman, if he can do it--

449
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:44,555
-...right in our neighborhood. 
Sharpe James, Sharpe James,

00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:47,686
what did Sharpe James do?
What did Sharpe James do?

- Yes! Mr. Simon?

00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,316
This is Caroline Booker.

457
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:11,046
I'm the mother of Cory Booker.

458

- *[narrator] Cory's parents have come to town*
*for the rest of the campaign.*

- *[Cory] My dad was born very poor*
*to a single parent in the south.*

464
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,466
You know, he had a tough, tough childhood.

465
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:37,306
I mean, you have to imagine
what it was like in '36 to be born

466
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:39,406
when they called it an illegitimate child.

467

*Really a self-made man*

*and really what I'm doing*
*is a result of my parents' guidance.*

469
00:20:45,716 --> 00:20:46,718
A lot of people ask me,

470
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:49,722
"Who is this boy with a Rhode scholarship
and a Yale Law?"

471
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:51,917
"And why would he wanna come to Newark?"

472
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,457
My father grew up in North Carolina.

473
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,992
And he still has physical scars on his body 
from being carved

474
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,761
by the White's Citizen Council 
in that town for being

475
00:20:58,793 --> 00:20:59,426
in the wrong side of town after dark.

476
00:20:59,864 --> 00:21:02,796
In '61, the civil movement 
started in North Carolina,

477
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,737
My father was one of the first 
people on the stools

478
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:08,507
being kicked, bruised rib,
being hurt basically in that civil movement.

479
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:09,902
Back in the later 60s,

480
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:13,472
my parents were the first African-Americans
in the entire northeastern seaboard

481
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:14,707
to be hired by IBM.

482
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:15,778
My mom, was first.

483
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:17,709
My dad soon became the first 
black salesman.

484
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,019
Has these awful stories about
making sales calls on people

485
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:20,880
and ripping up his cards,

486
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,950
saying, "You tell I.B.M. not to send 
any more nigger salesman out here."

487
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:26,908
My parents told me, "To he who much is given, 
much is expected."

488
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:30,023
And they expected their two children
to be a part of the struggle.

489
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:33,295
And I believe in my heart that
this Newark, New Jersey

490
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:35,627
and cities like it are frontiers
of the American dream.

491
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,530
And we as African-Americans
and we as Americans period,

492
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,836
have an obligation 
to fight for our communities.

765
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,500
- Did I dismiss you? 
Who do you think you yelling at?

766
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,931
Who do you think you yelling at?

767
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:28,507
-[reporter] Were you there?

768
00:34:28,507 --> 00:34:29,469
-*Who do you think you're yelling at?*

769
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,234
Hey! Young man!

770
00:34:30,374 --> 00:34:32,428
Who do you think you're yelling at
as a reporter?

771
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:34,139
Who you think you yelling at?

772
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,646
You better show some respect.

773
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:40,749
- Mayor James says that the only time
he went to club was when police raided it.

774
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,981
[phone ringing]

775
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:46,653
- You're here? 
Let me show something here a bit.

776
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,821
You got, "It wasn't me."

777
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,190
[telephone ringing]

778
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:53,730
- In that club?

779
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:54,659
- What?

780
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,602
- He saying it wasn't him in that club?

781
00:34:56,602 --> 00:34:57,762
- Yeah. Just read this.

782
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,768
- But did you see Channel 11 that night?

783
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:02,072
- Oh, when he got crazy?

784
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:04,872
- When he got up there,
and said that he was in there,

785
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:08,172
but to see what he could do about
closing it down.

786
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,841
[laughing]

787
00:35:10,613 --> 00:35:11,843
- *[narrator] Sharpe James made a speech*

788
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:14,912
*at a barbecue he hosted*
*for a housing project last night.*

789
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,792
- Oh, yeah! And he called Cory last night, "Baby Face".

790
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:21,791
- *[male voice] Sharpe did?*

791
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:22,694
- Yeah!

792
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:25,864
Baby Face is a snake, don't trust him.

793
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,428
I was so mad. 
I didn't know what in the world to do.

794
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:29,930
[woman mumbling]

795
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,294
-Yeah!

796
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,965
He had them all fooled last night.

797
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,867
[people talking]

798
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,402
-$$[female voice] Called Cory 
a white Republican, yes he did.$$

799
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,672
-[male voice] You were there?

800
00:35:39,672 --> 00:35:40,705
- Yeah, I live there.

801
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:41,573
- You heard him say it?

802
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,044
- Yes!

803
00:35:43,406 --> 00:35:47,515
*That's what came out in the mail-room today,*
White Republican.

804
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,719
He gave that out last night to everybody.

805
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,890
- [male voice] Unbelievable.

806
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,156
- *[narrator] They brush aside 
the Republican stuff*

807
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:57,796
*but the white comment stings.*

808
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:01,529
*And what it means to be black
is now becoming a major campaign issue*

809
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:02,257
*out in the streets.*

810
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:04,897
- The division, I mean--

811
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,143
and that's what I was telling people.

812
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:08,598
They were saying, "Oh, Cory's light skinned."

813
00:36:08,598 --> 00:36:09,860
"Oh, he's almost white."

814
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:12,006
I'm like, this is what has kept us,

815
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:15,776
all this time, separated and divided
amongst ourselves.

816
00:36:15,947 --> 00:36:18,717
*The racist comments that were coming*
*from the black people.*

817
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:22,304
An older lady walks up to my car and says,
"Who are you voting for?"

818
00:36:22,535 --> 00:36:24,756
"The white man or the black man?"

819
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:28,186
I said, "I'm voting for Cory Booker."

820
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:30,822
They're mad at Cory,

821
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,291
because his mother was able
to give him a good education.

822
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,960
Because he wasn't raised in the projects?

823
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,461
So what?

824
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:38,563
You know, he's still black.

825
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:43,342
If my mother had the opportunity
to raise me in a better environment,

826
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:46,271
and give me a good education,
I'm sure she would have done that.

827
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,584
You know, but you can't be mad at him
because he's making it.

828
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,742
You can't be mad at him
because he has a vision.

829
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:53,119
You know what I'm saying?

830
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,482
You can't be mad at that.

831
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,385
You know, you had to just say,

832
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:59,685
"You know what? Let's make it so
all our children can be that way."

833
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:02,825
Why play a hate on him
because he's doing well?

834
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:04,695
Stupid!

835
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,589
It's just stupid. Really stupid.

836
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:10,797
- *[narrator] Sharpe is quoted calling Cory,*
"A faggot white boy".

837
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:14,198
*And telling audiences*
*that he takes money from the Ku Klux Klan.*

838
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,338
*On the* Today Show,

839
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,909
*he says that Cory,*
*a Baptist, is actually Jewish.*

840
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:21,693
- *[Sharpe] He went to Stanford
and he's Jewish.*

841
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:27,153
He tells a story about his graduation,
where he couldn't date a white girl.

842
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:28,686
- *He also says of Cory,*

843
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:32,617
*"You have to learn to be African-American.
And we dont have time to train you."*

844
00:37:33,073 --> 00:37:35,720
*And all of this is just*
*when he's speaking on the record.*

845
00:37:35,928 --> 00:37:40,898
- We ask our black children get educated
and they do and we call them <i>White</i>.**

846
00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:44,798
That's sad.

847
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:46,669
It's truly sad.

848
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:50,569
And to believe that, 
it's not that Sharpe did that,

849
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,609
that's dirty, that's low.

850
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,639
Sharpe is a low individual.

851
00:37:55,379 --> 00:38:02,449
For them to believe it?
And they're talking about civil rights?

852
00:38:03,419 --> 00:38:07,619
These are people who have been through--
some of them have been through the 60s.

853
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,721
That's a disgrace to Martin Luther King,

854
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:16,260
to Malcolm X,

855
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,529
to <u></u><u></u><u></u>

856
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:26,709
And anybody and everybody who worked
like a demon to get us beyond that.

857
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:27,911
- And this is an attempt.

858
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:32,211
A really sad attempt by Sharpe James
to racialize his campaign.

859
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:35,851
And ignore--distract people
from what the real issues are,

860
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:39,791
safety, security, economic empowerment,
and good schools.

861
00:38:39,891 --> 00:38:41,891
The truth to the matter is
I'm an African American

862
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:44,361
who's benefited from the
legacy of struggle in our country.

863
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:48,032
I'm an African-American who benefited
from my parents' generation

864
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:49,801
who marched for me,

865
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:50,659
who sat in for me,

866
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:53,372
literally bled that southern soil
red for me.

867
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,132
I have been told by my family

868
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,237
never to forget where you came from
and the struggles

869
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:58,944
that got you to where you are.

870
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:01,015
And my grandfather who passed away
during this election,

871
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:02,935
the day I got my diploma from
Yale Law school,

872
00:39:02,935 --> 00:39:04,451
grabbed me by the arm and said,

873
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:07,244
"Dont you ever forget that the diploma
you are holding was paid for

874
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,816
in the blood, sweat and tears of your ancestors.

875
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:13,117
And if you wanna prove worthy
of that struggle,

876
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:14,652
then you must continue it.

877
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,226
If you wanna be proved worthy
of that legacy,

878
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:18,256
then you must roll up your sleeves
and get to work.

879
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,687
We're gonna make the changes, alright?

880
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:23,335
Thanks, guys. God Bless you.

881
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:24,996
My voice is shot.

882
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:29,006
- *[narrator] Cory is spending 
more hours everyday knocking on doors.*

883
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,810
- Oh, watch your head, watch your head,
don't hit your head.

884
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,379
Oh! You hit your head.

885
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:35,810
What's up big man?

886
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,808
-[kid] Fine.

887
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:39,377
- He promised that he can help mommy 
get a job so we can get out of here.

888
00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:42,918
What we're gonna do is

889
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:44,819
we're gonna definitely fight
to help people get more employment.

890
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,289
- We're gonna win this campaign
in the streets.

891
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,989
We're not gonna win this campaign
on T.V.

892
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,489
We're not gonna win this campaign
on radio.

893
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:51,929
We're gonna win this campaign in the streets.

894
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,862
- [announcer] Good morning
Ladies and gentlemen!

895
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:01,080
Let's get ready to rumble!

896
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:02,667
[crowd shouting]

897
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:06,006
IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE! 
IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE!

898
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:09,677
- *[narrator] The crowds at campaign events*
*is getting bigger and bigger.*

899
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,349
- [Cory] Now it's time that we pull together.

900
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:14,078
Black Newarker.

901
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:15,618
White Newarker.

902
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,486
Portuguese.

903
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:17,949
Brazilian.

904
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,120
*Puerto Rican.*

905
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,026
<i>Old.</i>

906
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,186
<i>Young.</i>

907
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:25,661
We need to be unified
because in unity give is strength.

908
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:27,892
There's an old African saying that says, 
"Sticks in a bundle can't be broken."

909
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:28,307
[crowd cheering]

910
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:39,776
- *[narrator] But the bigger the rally,*
*the bigger the bill.*

911
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:42,712
*And everything requires more fundraising.*

912
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:49,262
[car door slamming shut]

913
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:55,127
[crowd talking]

914
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:58,890
- You ain't seen this room?
Let me show you this room.

915
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:04,662
- *[Hiver] It's been described to me as*
The Card Room.

916
00:41:08,138 --> 00:41:09,771
Can you step in here Mr. Booker.

917
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,271
-You can step in Mr. Booker.

918
00:41:11,674 --> 00:41:15,573
- Can you imagine playing with
with three of your friends?

919
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:17,647
- In here?

920
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:18,242
- In here.

921
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,111
- Sure.

922
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:21,051
- Certain nights though.

923
00:41:21,051 --> 00:41:22,645
- Sure, you wanna play some cards?

924
00:41:23,288 --> 00:41:24,418
- Yeah.

925
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,882
- Roll the dice?

926
00:41:27,928 --> 00:41:29,954
-*[Cory] The people on this town
really have amazed me.*

927
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,757
And maybe you realize more
than any other place

928
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,292
the truth of what 
Martin Luther King said that,

929
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,762
"We are all caught in
an inescapable network of mutuality,

930
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:40,198
*tied in a common garment of destiny."*

931
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:43,373
That, "Injustice anywhere
is a threat to justice everywhere."

932
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,735
- [Cory] Jimmy?

933
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:45,311
- Yes, sir?

934
00:41:45,311 --> 00:41:46,906
- *[Cory] There are rich people in this world.*

935
00:41:46,906 --> 00:41:47,904
- You're telling me.

936
00:41:47,904 --> 00:41:49,205
- *[Cory] They live in some very large houses.*

937
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:53,179
- *[Hiver] I had to call my-- 
when I flushed the toilet*

938
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:55,383
*and it didn't make any noise?*

939
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:56,285
[male laughing]

940
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,547
- *[Cory] Left. I'm sorry. 
This way, this way.*

941
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,227
- *[Hiver] I said I got to call my girlfriend
and tell her about this.*

942
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,383
[male laughing]

943
00:42:02,383 --> 00:42:03,188
- *[Cory] What did Job say?*

944
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,975
*"Naked I came in to the world...*

945
00:42:04,975 --> 00:42:06,421
-*[narrator] Naked I came in to the world naked.*

946
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:08,359
*And naked I shall leave.*

947
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,463
-*[male voice] Does your toilet
make a sound?"*

948
00:42:10,463 --> 00:42:11,836
[Cory laughing]

949
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:14,301
-[female voice] *Hey there, Cory!"*

950
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:16,234
-[Cory] I did really well.

951
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,868
- *[male voice] Hey, did you see 
the total for today?*

952
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,673
- What was the total for today?

953
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,143
- *[male] Sixty four.*

954
00:42:21,714 --> 00:42:23,180
- *[narrator] That's $64,000.*

955
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:24,780
*for the day.*

956
00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:25,984
- *[Cory] Pretty damn good.*

957
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:30,080
- *[narrator] Cory's fundraising efforts 
has managed to surpass Sharpe's.*

958
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,657
*Their filings with the government
showed that *

959
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:35,220
*each side has raised between two 
and a half and three million dollars,*

960
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,421
*which should be a huge boost for Cory.*

961
00:42:37,562 --> 00:42:39,262
*It shows that he's a real competitor.*

962
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:42,593
*But Sharpe has managed to turn*
*this advantage into a disadvantage.*

963
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:44,192
*Everywhere he goes,*

964
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:47,432
*He's saying that Cory has raised*
*10 million dollars, not three.*

965
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,369
*And he's trying to buy the election.*

966
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:51,407
- Ten Million dollars can buy a lot of votes.

967
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,875
Why does Cory Booker, after four years 
in Newark, have 10 million dollars?

968
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:01,481
If money can buy an election,
then it will.

969
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:04,015
But what the people is saying in Newark,

970
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,050
- [together] Newark is not for sale!

971
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:06,889
- Booker can't buy this.

972
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:07,821
- *[male voice] Not for Sale!*

973
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:10,894
- [together] Newark is not for sale!

974
00:43:10,894 --> 00:43:14,094
- [Cory] Well, Sharpe has this amazing ability
to tell a lie so many times,

975
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:16,361
that people believes that it is the truth.

976
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:19,702
*If the mayor of city is saying this,*

977
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,333
you're threatening to put some <u></u><u></u> here.

978
00:43:22,626 --> 00:43:25,104
- *[narrator] Even I began to wonder whether
perhaps I was being spun*

979
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,339
*by the Booker folks.*

980
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:28,512
*So I confirmed by looking online.*

981
00:43:28,512 --> 00:43:31,642
*It's all public information
on a government website.*

982
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,711
- [Cory] So we don't have 10 million dollars?

983
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:36,350
- *[narrator] But it's not just a matter of*
*how much money there is.*

984
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,115
*It's also where it comes from.*

985
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:40,089
*An anonymous flyer goes out,*

986
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,822
*accusing Cory of conspiring with Jews
to take over the city.*

987
00:43:44,232 --> 00:43:48,407
*Sharpe tells reporters that Cory is 
propped up by white right-wing investors.*

988
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:52,834
- Because of the extreme root for white
right-wing Republican party

989
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,338
who is supporting him.

990
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:56,808
- *[narrator] His commercials and speeches
and mailings*

991
00:43:56,808 --> 00:43:58,536
*all push the message hard.*

992
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:00,539
- [Cory] I'm a tool for the Republic Party.

993
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,107
I confess it.

994
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,707
- [Jen] I thought you were a tool of the Jews.

995
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:07,546
- I'm a tool of the Jews, the Republican party,
Afghanistan, the Taliban.

996
00:44:07,918 --> 00:44:09,013
[laughing]

997
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,182
I am a member of the KKK.

998
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:13,388
I'm part of the CIA conspiracy.

999
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,054
- Oh, you wanna know what 
the newest one is?

1000
00:44:15,054 --> 00:44:16,255
- [Cory] What?
- You know what the newest one is?

1001
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,055
- I'm gay?

1002
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,690
-There's a media conspiracy
to elect Cory Booker.

1003
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:21,525
- I'm part of the media conspiracy.

*98.7 Kiss WRKS FM New York.*

1006
00:44:35,046 --> 00:44:37,998
And our guest, candidate for mayor
of the city of Newark, New Jersey,

1007
00:44:37,998 --> 00:44:39,011
Cory Booker.

1008
00:44:39,011 --> 00:44:40,419
He says he's a Democrat.

1009
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:44,389
*No matter what some of these people*

[Cory laughing]

1014
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,634
- *[DJ 2] What is this dalliance with Republicans?*

1015
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,399
That you know of course,
you say the word, "Republican"

1016
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,930
and black voters are ready to run.

1017
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:01,465
- [Cory] Well, let's just put it this way.

1018
00:45:01,504 --> 00:45:02,704
I'm a Democrat.

1019
00:45:02,804 --> 00:45:06,644
If there are some moderate Republicans
who have chosen to support me,

1020
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,048
*that's their prerogative.*

1021
00:45:08,048 --> 00:45:10,441
What my focus has been since
I've been a young man,

1022
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,509
is working to make sure
the Democratic Party

1023
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:13,829
is as strong as it can be,

1024
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:16,184
*so that the needs of*
*inner city communities are met.*

1025
00:45:16,515 --> 00:45:19,185
So I'm proud of my root 
in the Democrat Party.

1026
00:45:19,185 --> 00:45:23,470
And I'm tired, frankly, of Sharpe James
trying to cast this debate

1027
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,055
in terms of Republican and Democrat

1028
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,896
as opposed to what he should be casting 
in terms is,

1029
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:29,596
why does his city have a poverty rate
that's going up?

1030
00:45:29,696 --> 00:45:31,867
Why is his city have an unemployment rate going up?

1031
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:37,337
- But do you think it's spoken now 
to align yourself with extremist

1032
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:40,953
or far right people like J.C. Watts? 
I mean, you know...

1033
00:45:40,953 --> 00:45:43,417
- I'm sorry. I'm not sure 
what you're talking about.

1034
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:43,978
- Hold on a second--

1035
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:45,335
- I've never met J.C. Watts.

1036
00:45:45,335 --> 00:45:45,888
- Alright.

1037
00:45:45,888 --> 00:45:47,142
- Nor have aligned myself with him.

1038
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:48,752
- Listen, I mean, you have had no sort
of alliances with them?

1039
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:49,782
- None, whatsoever.

1040
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,989
- Sort of the Republican handlers,
anybody coming to you, "I wanna bring you..."

1041
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:58,089
- These smear campaigns really concern me
because I've never met J.C. Watts.

1042
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,959
I've never met a lot of the people
he's talking about.

1043
00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:02,359
I've been a lifelong Democrat.

1044
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:03,413
And suddenly, here we are,

1045
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:05,868
wasting time talking about
Sharpe James' accusations.

1046
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:07,431
- Here's the problem though, Cory,

1047
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,001
and I think that people are confusing
your broad-based support,

1048
00:46:10,232 --> 00:46:13,641
I mean, I gather, just from looking
at the contributors

1049
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,877
and looking where the money's coming from,
you're getting a broad base of support.

1050
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,218
And you know what, Cory?
That scares people.

1051
00:46:20,371 --> 00:46:21,282
- Well, let me tell you this,

1052
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:23,466
this is what is almost comical about this,

1053
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:26,322
the majority of Sharpe James' supporters
are developers

1054
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,322
and people that have city contracts.

1055
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,722
And the majority of those are people
that don't live in the city of Newark.

1056
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:33,594
And the majority of those happen
to be white.

1057
00:46:33,594 --> 00:46:34,726
- *[DJ 2] Republicans?*

1058
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:36,296
- Many of them are Republicans as well.

1059
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:41,435
So, here's a man, who is allowing our city,
the most the precious resource that we have,

1060
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:42,651
our 600 million dollar budget,

1061
00:46:42,651 --> 00:46:45,676
87% of those contracts are being taken
by outsiders.

1062
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:49,506
- *[DJ] And we will be right back
with our guest, Cory Booker.*

1063
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,350
A Democratic candidate for mayor
of the city of Newark, New Jersey,

1064
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:54,581
after these messages.

1067
00:46:59,023 --> 00:46:59,854
[laughing]

1068
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:01,185
- I was...
- *We knew you can handle it.*

1069
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:02,520
- Now Im waking up. Before, I wasnt awake

1070
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:06,123
- *[Radio DJ] Look, I've given Cory a hard time*

- Today, I'm endorsing
Cory Booker for mayor of Newark,

1081
00:47:36,746 --> 00:47:40,899
because I believe he is Newark's best hope
for the future.

1082
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,429
Cory represents the best of the
Democratic Party,

1083
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:50,809
honored by both the DNC and the DLC

1084
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,617
and asked to speak at the
Democratic National Convention.

1085
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:58,675
So if anyone tells you Cory Booker 
is not a Democrat,

1086
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,979
they got a lot of people they got to argue with.

people lying to us and telling us,

1090
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:14,096
"We're gonna do this.

1091
00:48:14,096 --> 00:48:15,996
If you elect me, I'm gonna do this."

1092
00:48:15,997 --> 00:48:18,205
And then you get into office 
and you work part-time

1093
00:48:18,205 --> 00:48:20,028
and you don't do what you say you're gonna do

1094
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:21,813
And then our streets still look like they look,

1095
00:48:21,813 --> 00:48:23,183

1096

- Okay?

because I'm not into politics*

and now they're disappointed at the fact

1107
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:44,221
that some of the things 
that you have promised that you have not done--

1108
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:45,960
- *Specifically what?*

1109

- Okay. You said you live in Brick Towers.

1110

There is not proof that you have lived
in Brick Towers.

*what people are saying,*

but I'm simply saying, I'm asking you
to look at my record.

1119

And if you want to right now,

*I got dirty laundry on my floor.*

People say, "I'm tired of politicians
lying to them."

1125
00:49:17,761 --> 00:49:21,331
That's because we've had the same politicians there for 32 years.

Thirty-two years.

1127

we've been lied to for so long.

1164

32 of those years,

Washington D.C. with Marion Barry.

1175
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:33,823
I mean, how's a guy who gets busted
for what he's busted with get re-elected?

1176
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,760
And essentially, people begin
to feel defensive about,

either folks from the outside

1178

or other people going after 
somebody who they felt is their guy.

1179
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:47,404
- [Cory] Is this going to damage--I mean,
I had two seniors today tell me

1180
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:49,973
they were really respected the way
I was running this campaign

1181
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:54,082
and not running a negative campaign 
like Sharpe is--yada-yada-yada.

1182
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:57,287
So, now, I wanna make sure 
we dont have a backlash as a result of this

01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:04,683
Let us show our dignity

1666
01:18:04,714 --> 01:18:07,253
and our love for the city of Newark.

1667
01:18:07,423 --> 01:18:09,224
by not giving up our principle,

1668
01:18:09,254 --> 01:18:11,153
by not giving up our passion,

1669
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:14,990
by staying persistent in this cause
and in this fight.

1670
01:18:15,163 --> 01:18:16,825
I want all of you to know,

1671
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:18,263
who struggled so hard,

1672
01:18:18,263 --> 01:18:21,330
who put your faith in me and my leadership,

1673
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:24,865
that I have not yet begun to fight.

1674
01:18:25,774 --> 01:18:27,304
Thank you all! God Bless you!

1676
01:18:55,465 --> 01:18:58,935
- I've never had this kinda experience in my life,
where something bad happened

1677
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:02,170
or against my expectations
that didn't turn out to be better.

1678
01:19:03,859 --> 01:19:05,910
For the better for some reason.

1679
01:19:06,207 --> 01:19:09,447
You know, in my mind
I keep of thinking of a victory speech

1680
01:19:09,447 --> 01:19:11,919
and not having to wing a concession speech.

1681
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:14,791
But I wanted everybody to hold hands.

1682
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,628
And I wanted to talk about the different people

1683
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:18,421
that were holding hands that one moment,

1684
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:21,091
and what those people are
able to accomplish and achieve.

1685
01:19:21,091 --> 01:19:24,527
And the power they were able to bring to bear
wasn't the power of an individual.

1686
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:27,467
We're one race, one color, even the age groups,

1687
01:19:27,467 --> 01:19:31,335
I mean, there were teenagers,
kids that worked on the campaign to

1688
01:19:31,335 --> 01:19:32,835
And senior citizens.

1691
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:44,713
Feeling a bit, you know, embattled, 
but also feeling incredibly really good.

1692
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:47,916
We fought one hell of a fight
and I wish you could--

1693
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,160
all the things that were going on.

1694
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,822
It was just phenomenal.

1695
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,630
- *[Cory] And I've learned something.
I learned something.*

Real courage is like the famous poem 
by Maya Angelou, who says,

1697
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,104
"You may be writing me down in history

1698
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,541
with your bitter, twisted lies.

1699
01:20:10,541 --> 01:20:13,380
You may ground down in the very dirt

1700
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:17,312
but like dust, still I rise."
