00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:18,339
And I'm like "I cant, I'm in bed",
and he would then threaten me

152
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:23,433
I'd walk in from training 
and he'd be sleeping in my bed.

153
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,051
When we went to 
one of the higher‐ups

154
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:29,314
in the chain of command,
they were all like his drinking buddy

155
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:32,566
and they told me just because
I didn't like somebody,

156
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:36,953
they weren't going to switch me
away from this guy.

157
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:40,858
It was in the evening, around taps,
and he had unlocked the door

158
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:43,889
and he had come in,
and he had an erection

159
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,754
and he tried to get me to touch him.

160
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,333
I took my right hand and
I pushed him in the chest

161
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:54,498
and started to yell for the other guys
to try to kinda hear me, "Hey, hey, hey."

162
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:59,111
He hit me across
the left side of my face.

163
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:05,911
I remember holding the closet thinking, 
"What just happened?"

164
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:08,784
And my face hurts so bad.

165
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,090
And when we went
to the command about it,

166
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,092
me and this petty officer 
who saw my face,

167
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:22,249
they just let it wait cause they 
didn't want any problems going on.

168
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:28,361
A couple weeks later, 
I needed the key to do my cleanup

169
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,845
so I knocked on his door
and he said,

170
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,583
"Okay, yeah. come on in here. 
It's in here."

171
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,468
And I said, "No, no, no,
I'm gonna wait out here."

172
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,426
And he said screamed at me 
and he made me come in,

173
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:38,930
and he grabbed my arm

174
00:10:40,854 --> 00:11:04,443
[sobbing]

175
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:06,514
and he raped me at his birthing area.

176
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:12,908
[Jessica HInves] Everything came
to a complete change

177
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:15,022
the day that I was raped.

178
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:18,361
[Trina McDonald] I got there in February
and by April

179
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,757
I was drugged and raped
for the first time.

180
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:24,726
[Robin Lynn Lafayette] I had a cold 
or pneumonia-like symptoms

181
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:30,798
and so they sent me to get checked out. 
And, while I was waiting to be examined,

182
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:33,364
he came in and he helped himself.

183
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:34,861
[Jessica Hinves] He said he was
going to the bathroom

184
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,403
and he came into my room
and that's when he raped me.

185
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:41,917
[Hannah Sewell] The entire time
I was screaming and yelling

186
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:45,542
for help and for him to stop, 
nobody came to the door,

187
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:50,278
nobody came to help,
came to my rescue or anything.

188
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:56,354
[Trina McDonald] They made it very, 
very clear that if I said anything,

189
00:11:56,354 --> 00:11:59,997
they were going to kill me, you know, 
and then of course,

190
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:02,833
I didn't have anyone to go talk to
because the people that

191
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,370
were perpetrating me were the police.

192
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:12,457
[Hannah Sewell] It was my first time ever, 
and I've had a tough time

193
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:16,147
convincing myself that I'm still a virgin.

194
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:21,725
[Trina McDonald] If this is happening to me, 
you know, surely I'm not the only one,

195
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:27,080
in which I find out later, going through 
the claims process, that I wasn't.

196
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:35,605
$$ Over 20% of female veterans have been 
sexually assaulted while serving. $$

197
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:42,720
[Robin Khale] It's just after 3 am, I see 
a shadow of a human head over my body.

198
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,120
[Ayana Defour] Next thing you know, 
like I wake up and like he's on top of me.

199
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,659
[Christina Jones] He pushed my legs apart 
and put himself on top of me

200
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:52,322
and started pulling at my shirt.

201
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:57,130
[Debra Dickerson] And I wake up, 
and he's on top of me.

202
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,193
He's already penetrated me.

203
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:05,544
[Regina Vasquez] I was drugged. 
I remember the sounds, the smell.

204
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:09,801
[Lee Le Teff] He put his locked and loaded
45 at the base of my skull,

205
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:13,531
and gauged the bolt so that I knew 
that it was around chambered.

206
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:16,632
[Katie Webber] All I could do was continue 
to concentrate on breathing.

207
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:19,742
[Tia Christopher] He slammed my head 
against the concrete wall

208
00:13:19,742 --> 00:13:22,785
and very forcefully had sex with me.

209
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:26,641
[Jessica Brakey] I just went to my tent, 
pulled the sleeping bag over my head

210
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,617
and cried myself to sleep.

211
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:32,078
[Teah Bedney] So, within the 
two-week period,

212
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,117
he raped me five times.

213
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:40,550
[Valine Demos] When we got tested, 
I had Trich and gonorrhea

214
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,039
and I was pregnant.

215
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:53,879
[Kristen Miller] And he did it. 
He raped me.

216
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,214
[Amy Herdy] In 1991, 
in Congressional testimony,

217
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:59,648
it was estimated that 200,000 women
had been sexually assaulted so far

218
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:01,859
in the US Military. 
If you take into account that women

219
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:05,898
don't report because of
the extreme retaliation and that was,

220
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:08,159
you know, 
more than a decade ago.

221
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,291
I would say you could easily
double that number

222
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,709
and it's probably somewhere near about
half a million women have now been

223
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,636
sexually assaulted in the US military.

224
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:18,560
[Capt. Anu Bhagwati] Well, according to 
the Department of Defense,

225
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:26,629
3,230 women and men reported assault
in the last fiscal year, fiscal year 2009.

226
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:32,303
But they also admit, D.O.D itself, 
that 80% of sexual assault survivors

227
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:39,124
do not report. So if you do the math, 
16,150 service members

228
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:47,490
were assaulted,
which is an extraordinary number.

229
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,194
*[vial dropped]*

230
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,735
*[cluttering sound]*

231
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:57,535
- [Kori Cioca] We have more in the cars, Rob.

232
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,642
[cluttering sound]

233
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:00,880
There's some of it here, too.

234
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,522
This all was prescribed 
in the last three to four months.

235
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:06,274
This is <i>Proxatine</i>, this is <i>Seroquel,</i>
<i>Seroquel...</i>**

236
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:12,547
Citolopram, this is <i>Xanax.</i>

237
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:20,214
I'm tired of taking all these meds.
I just want the VA to fix my jaw.

238
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:23,328
I was having the most horrible
pain in my face,

239
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:27,406
so I went to the dentist because 
I thought it was my teeth

240
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:30,200
or something was wrong. 
The doctor came in after the X‐ rays

241
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,426
and asked me if I had been 
in a car accident.

242
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:35,822
When he hit me in my face,
he dislocated my jaw

243
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:39,418
and it sent both of my disks 
forward in my face so I don't have

244
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:43,078
any disks where they should be in my face.

245
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,554
They told me I'd probably need a
partial bone replacement.

246
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:49,361
From where my bone had been laying 
on my nerves for so long,

247
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:52,614
it's starting to actually disintegrate.

248
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:59,274
I've been on a soft diet for five years now.
I can't eat the foods that I used to eat.

249
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:09,485
Everything is mashed potatoes, Jell-o.

250
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:13,314
*[wind whistling]*

251
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:16,586
Well, I can go out 
during the summer time,

252
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:18,028
spring time... if it's warm. 
If it's too cold outside,

253
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:21,459
it's usually just Rob and Shea 
go outside.

254
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:26,404
When it's really cold, 
it's like my jaw would just lock up.

255
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:28,008
I just stand, watch from the window

256
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:35,545
and hear about the stories 
when they come in.

257
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:38,105
*[Man on VA] We are sorry, 
but due to a large volume of calls *

258
00:16:38,105 --> 00:16:43,920
*and unusually long wait times, counselors 
are unable to answer your call at this time. *

259
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,086
*[Woman on VA] Please stay on the line,
the calls will be answered*

260
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:47,863
*in the order received.*

261

*[Man on VA] 15 minutes could save
you hundreds on car insurance. *

262

*[Woman on VA] It's the Saint Louis 
holiday tradition. *

263
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,895
*[Colbie Caillat playing on background]*

264
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:04,369
*[Man on VA] Hey, this is Stan. *

265
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:07,636
[Kori Cioca] Hi Stan, I just wanted to check 
the status of my VA claim.

266
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:10,301
*[Stan] It's still on file on admissions, 
let me check.
*

267
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:11,609
[Kori Cioca] Okay--

268
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:12,801
It looks like it's about a year old now.

269
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:17,444
[Kori Cioca] Yes, it is. 
Okay it's still pending?

270
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:20,615
Did it say what status it was in?

271
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:26,160
*[Stan] Well, it looks like they've gathered 
all the information that they need *

272
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,089
*but it still hasn't moved to the rating board yet. 
*

273
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,792
[Kori Cioca] Okay.

274
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:32,722
*[Stan] Thank you for calling ma'am.
You have a good day. *

275
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:33,630
[Kori Cioca] You too. Thank you.

276
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,403
This is the stuff they prescribed me 
for migraines

277
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:36,282
even though I don't have migraines.

278
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:37,983
So, I was looking online
and there are actually other vets

279
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:39,385
at the age of like, 25 
and they would actually just die

280
00:17:39,385 --> 00:17:44,781
because their body wasn't processing

281
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:51,319
because the mixture of the Seroquel, 
the Gavapentin, the some kind of anxiety,

282
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,644
which was the Xanax 
and, there was something else,

283
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:57,638
an antidepressant. 
The mixtures of that stuff,

284
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:59,300
which is everything I have here that

285
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:22,483
other vets were taking
and they have died.

286
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:26,816
*[door shuts]*

287
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:28,177
- *Hey, baby girl. Hey, hey.* 
- *Sit. *

288
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:36,978
[Hannah Sewell] Both my dad 
and my brother are prior Navy

289
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,232
and now Army National Guards.

290
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:42,481
And it's kind of like it follows in the family 
and follows the footsteps.

291
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:46,437
I was excited and completely 
just hyped up about going.

292
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:53,573
All my family was proud of me.
My dad is my biggest hero.

293
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:56,348
[Sgt. Major Jerry Sewell] I told her, I said,
"You are going to be taken care of."

294
00:18:56,348 --> 00:19:02,587
And I guess that's one of the hard things
that I have to accept because

295
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:10,407
I told her that she would be. 
It was in February, we got a call.

296
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:13,634
$$ On February 1st 2008,
Hannah was locked in a hotel room

297
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:19,136
and raped by a fellow recruit. $$

298
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:20,666
[Hannah Sewell] Once he was done,

299
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:25,008
he rubbed his hand 
all over my entire body

300
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:30,093
and told me, he said,
"I own all of this."

301
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:34,157
And I was just absolutely scared,
didn't know what to do.

302
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:36,674
I called my dad.

303
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:38,925
[Sgt. Major Jerry Sewell] 
One of the first things she said is,

304
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:45,803
"Dad, I'm no longer a virgin."

305
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:55,894
And I said, "What happened?" 
And she said, "I was raped."

306
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,741
And I said,
"Hannah, you're a virgin because

307
00:19:57,741 --> 00:20:07,205
he took something from you
that you didn't give."

308
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:12,612
I said, "So, don't ever think you're not."

309
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:16,085
[Hannah Sewell] My main nerve 
in my spine was pinched in three places

310
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:18,195
and my hips were rotated.

311
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:23,198
I could barely walk. I had collapsed due
to muscle spasms in my back

312
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:30,817
because my back
was injured during the rape.

313
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:33,157
[Admiral Anthony Kurta] My title is
Director of Military Plans

314
00:20:33,157 --> 00:20:36,530
and Personnel policy for the Navy.

315
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,196
We have specifically trained
judge advocates.

316
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:43,665
Our Navy lawyers, in our naval criminal
investigative service,

317
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:46,623
those investigating are all specifically
trained in sexual assault.

318
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:49,296
Any report of a sexual assault 
is fully investigated

319
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:51,560
in the United States Navy.

320
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,934
[Sgt. Major Jerry Sewell] 
They didn't take care of it.

321
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,460
For a year and a half, 
they were tracking down witnesses.

322
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,568
They had all these students there 
and they could have locked them down

323
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:02,240
and said, "Hey you're on legal hold 
and not leaving till I get this statement."

324
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,420
And they didn't. Hannah went through 
three investigators.

325
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,510
It was like, "Okay I'm giving this case."
That's what it sort of felt like.

326
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,892
"Oh, alright I'm giving this case.
I'll take care of it.

327
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:15,741
Oh well this isn't even one.
I really don't have the time to deal with it."

328
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,996
[Captain Greg Rinckey] Females would
come up to their commander

329
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:21,235
or their NCOs and say that they were
either sexually assaulted or abused

330
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:23,758
and I don't think it was taken seriously.

331
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:26,985
I think a lot of times
a cursory investigation was done

332
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:30,324
and they were basically just told
to suck it up.

333
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:32,469
[Staff Sgt. Stace Nelson] I remember
bringing in a young service member

334
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:34,460
who had been brutally raped, 
and bringing her in to see her command,

335
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,834
and trying to make sure that this 
young girl was taken care of properly.

336
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:45,432
And this idiot, chewed her out for crying,
told her to stop crying over spilt milk.

337
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:48,255
[Captain Greg Rinckey] A lot of times,
the credibility of the witness

338
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:50,676
was called into account.
Had the potential victim,

339
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,089
had she made claims
like this in the past?

340
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,586
There was a lot of witch hunting going on.

341
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:59,473
[Maya Haider] I was ordered
to advise a victim of her rights

342
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:03,581
for false statement when I knew 
that she wasn't lying.

343
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,003
I was asked to bring her in 
and advise her of her rights,

344
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:08,347
like a criminal and interrogate her
for false statement,

345
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:11,258
"until I got the truth out of her."

346
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:14,908
If the woman makes a rape complaint,
they are always people asking

347
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:17,809
what she was doing there, 
what she was wearing,

348
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,984
whether she had a boyfriend or not.

349
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:22,792
[Miette Wells] If any rape cases came in, 
they were never given to women.

350
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:28,628
The men always took care of those 
because we were too sympathetic.

351
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:34,954
We couldn't see what was really going on
because we always took the woman's side.

352
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,228
[Maya Haider] I was told
I should have been a social worker.

353
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:39,892
I had no business being 
in the police field.

354
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:46,172
There was a lot of resistance there
toward the idea that victims should be

355
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:50,307
afforded some kind of sensitivity.
It was almost a laughing matter.

356
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:53,110
[Admiral Anthony Kurta] We have given
specific training and continual training

357
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,410
to our NCIS, 
Navy Criminal Investigative Service,

358
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:03,120
those investigators on how best to respond
and to investigate those crimes.

359
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:11,892
[Hannah Sewell] They told me
they lost my rape kit

360
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:23,056
and my nurse examiners report and the
pictures from the bruising on my arm.

361
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:24,281
*[Amy] They lost these things? *

362
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:25,964
[Hannah Sewell] That's what they told me, 
that they had lost them.

363
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:33,127
And me being me,
I decided to do a little digging

364
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:37,970
of my own and I spoke with 
NCIS headquartersin Washington DC,

365
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,871
and they have all the evidence.

366
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:44,068
*[Amy] So what does this mean? *

367
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:45,793
[Hannah Sewell] Because the case
is already closed,

368
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:52,305
there's nothing they can do.

369
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,032
[Susan Burke] What we hear
again and again

370
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,881
from soldiers who have been raped,

371
00:23:56,881 --> 00:24:01,889
as bad as it was being raped, 
what was as bad, if not worse,

372
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:05,856
was to receive professional retaliation

373
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:07,808
in their chosen career, 
merely because they were raped.

374
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:11,760
[Theresa Verderber-Phillips] 
When you report something,

375
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,494
you better be prepared 
for the repercussions.

376
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:18,959
[Debra Dickerson] If a man 
gets accused of rape, it's a set‐up.

377
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,506
The woman is lying.

378
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:23,009
[Rebecca Catagnus] I could choose
to report it, but if they found that

379
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:28,437
what I was saying wasn't to be truthful, 
then I would be reduced in rank.

380
00:24:28,437 --> 00:24:31,211
[Allison Gill] You could lose your rate, 
you could loose rank,

381
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:34,271
you could loose your school, 
if you file a false report.

382
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:37,929
So do you want to file a report? 
[Laughs]

383
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:40,436
[Christina Jones] Even with the rape kit 
and everything,

384
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:44,630
and my friend catching him raping me,
they still don't believe me.

385
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,127
[Tandy Fink] I reported it two 
different times to my squad leader

386
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:51,704
and he told me that
there was nothing he could do about it

387
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:53,479
'cause he didn't have any proof.

388
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:58,322
[Andrea Werner] They actually did 
charge me with adultery.

389
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,627
I wasn't married. He was.

390
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:04,028
[Tia Christopher] They took me 
before my lieutenant commander.

391
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:07,216
He says, "You think this is funny?"
I said, "What do you mean?"

392
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:09,136
He said, "You think this is all 
a joke to you?"

393
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:11,052
I said, "What do you mean?"

394
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:14,854
And he goes, "You're the third girl
to report rape this week.

395
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:23,733
Are you guys like, all in cahoots,
you think this is a game?"

396
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:26,725
*[Man on VA] We are sorry, 
but due to a large volume of calls *

397
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:31,545
*and unusually long wait times, *

398
00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:33,909
*counselors are unable 
to answer your call at this time. *

399
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,837
*[Woman on VA] Your name, please? *

400
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:38,157
[Kori Cioco] Kori Danielle McDonald.

401
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:40,481
*[Woman on VA] Okay, I show
that we've got a claim *

402
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:45,580
*open for non‐service‐connected 
disability pension, depression, TMJ, *

403
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,422
*bilateral disk condition,
PTSD, nerve‐damage.*

404
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:54,197
*It's at the rating board in Cleveland. *

405
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:57,334
[Kori Cioca] Okay, and how long 
does that usually take?

406
00:25:57,334 --> 00:26:00,537
*[Woman on VA] Anywhere
from 102 to 139 days. *

407
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:01,812
[Kori Cioca] Really?

408
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,047
*[Woman on VA] And that's just
an estimated time. *

409
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:08,898
[Kori Cioca] 139 days? 
I mean that's like--

410
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:10,994
I've already be waiting like 14 months.

411
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:14,915
What the fuck is going on up there? 
What the fuck is going on at the VA?

412
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:20,309
Like, my shit is new? 
And, it's 14 months?

413
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:26,278
I bet if we were there in person, 
they would have to do something.

414
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:28,491
[car starts]

415
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:30,464
[car revvs]

416
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,069
Are you ready? Say ready.
Where are we going?

417
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,563
[both] Where are we going?

418
00:26:32,563 --> 00:26:34,903
[chewing]

419
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:38,494
No, to the doctor. 
Why are we going to the doctor?

420
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:46,710
What hurts on mommy?
My face, that's right.

421
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,760
- "You're gonna want to get on 75 North."
- " On 75 North?"

422
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,086
- "Yup."

423
00:26:55,086 --> 00:26:58,193
This goes everywhere with me, 
and then this goes everywhere with me.

424
00:26:58,193 --> 00:27:03,721
You always have protection
with Jesus but sometimes

425
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:09,716
you need just a little bit more.

426
00:27:09,716 --> 00:27:22,452
[Rob McDonald]
In doctor's appointments,

427
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:26,293
I come to every one just in case
she gets worked up

428
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:30,226
and she's uneasy about men already.
So, I have my phone up on me,

429
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:35,253
she has, I tell her to have 
a text message or me on speed dial

430
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,591
if she needs to get out of there.

431
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:51,855
How did it go?

432
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:59,480
[Kori Cioca] It went good.
They, of course, ordered a back x‐ray

433
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,552
instead of a face x‐ray.
Here's some make‐up.

434
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:09,160
They should know 
what's wrong with me.

435
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,325
Like read my stuff 
and you'll see it's my face.

436
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:14,345
It's not my back, it's not my legs,
it's not my arms, it's my face.

437
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:17,401
[Rob McDonald] The people 
who need your proof don't even know

438
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,277
what your case is about, like 
I don't even know why we wasted

439
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:21,211
the gas money,
the trip, anything.

440
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:26,111
It was completely a waste of time.
What a good Veterans Day, right?

441
00:28:26,111 --> 00:28:29,016
[Rob McDonald] 
Yeah, it's a perfect way to spend it.

442
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:39,136
[Kori Cioca] Yeah, screw it.

443
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:47,675
[Rob McDonald] Alright, it's 
around midnight on October 24th,

444
00:28:47,675 --> 00:28:53,799
and Kori woke up, myself
and our baby.

445
00:28:53,799 --> 00:29:01,068
She woke up screaming
so it's been happening quite a bit.

446
00:29:01,068 --> 00:29:02,650
[crickets chirping]

447
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,249
- Okay, go go.

448
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:05,815
[leaves crunching]

449
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:08,058
- Oh!
- One more.

450
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:11,688
- I'm sorry I woke you up, 
but it's fun, right? You're having fun.

451
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:14,086
- Let's put more.
- Yeah, let's put more.

452
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,927
I think Kori almost likes it better
because it's quiet

453
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:33,857
and you don't really know
what to run into at midnight.

454
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,151
[Trina McDonald] Because it was 
in isolated duty station,

455
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:40,453
they kind of had their own world 
of things going on.

456
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:42,251
They were in charge 
and we were just kind of like, cattle.

457
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:46,235
The first time I was drugged 
and raped, I was in this room

458
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:49,755
with some of my friends
and I only had like one or two drinks.

459
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,049
I went and laid down.
It was like instantly,

460
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:58,835
I was not feeling well and it came 
to having a pillow over my head

461
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:04,139
and my friend raping me.

462
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:08,588
And that went on repeatedly. 
You had to call an operator

463
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:14,011
to get a line off base so they listen 
to your phone calls so they were screened

464
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:21,157
and I used to call my dad and begged him
to get me out of there.

465
00:30:21,157 --> 00:30:24,158
He would always ask me, 
you know, "Hon, well what's wrong?"

466
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:26,333
And I'm like,
"I can't tell you what's wrong,"

467
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:29,250
because the people who were listening
to our phone calls,

468
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,865
were the same people that could hurt me.

469
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:36,735
[Russell Strand] 
Most sex offenders are hunters.

470
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,202
Just like any hunter,
they study their prey,

471
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:40,543
they study their movements,

472
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:42,013
they study their behaviors,
they study the environment.

473
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:47,609
[Staff Sgt. Stace Nelson] You have rapists 
that prey on other human beings.

474
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:53,314
They stalk them, 
they wait until the victim

475
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:56,922
is at the most vulnerable point in time
to perpetrate their crimes.

476
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,746
[Myla Haider] A lot of times 
the victim is somebody

477
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:02,118
that the suspect is very familiar with

478
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:06,059
and they're very aware 
of what's going on.

479
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,533
[Russell Strand] Most sex offenders 
have this hidden persona

480
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,052
that nobody ever sees
other than the victim.

481
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:13,747
Therefore when they're caught
or when somebody reports,

482
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,183
people don't tend to believe that

483
00:31:15,183 --> 00:31:18,278
because they don't see
the typical sex offender.

484
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:19,584
[Captain Greg Rinckey] 
If it's an officer,

485
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:22,862
it's an officer that has habitually,
in the past, preyed on an enlisted.

486
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:25,511
They would do it once, 
they would get away with it,

487
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:26,625
and then they think,

488
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,569
"Wow this is pretty easy,
I'm going to try it again."

489
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:33,698
[Brigadier Gen. Lorre Sutton] Particularly
for a savvy perpetrator,

490
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:39,833
to work with within a relatively 
closed system, like the military,

491
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:48,173
it becomes a prime target rich
environment for a predator.

492
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:53,658
$$ A navy study found that 15 percent 
of incoming recruits

493
00:31:53,658 --> 00:32:00,071
attempted or committed rape
before entering the military.

494
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:08,001
Twice the percentage of the 
equivalent civilian population. $$

495
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:15,405
[Trina McDonald] When I was discharged, I moved to
Seattle where things got really bad.

496
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:19,225
I started to lose everything.

497
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:27,406
I was homeless, there was addiction,
I was selling drugs, packing gun.

498
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:32,021
[Helen Benedict] Forty percent of homeless 
female veterans have been raped

499
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:38,111
while they were serving. They spin into such
depression and abuse that they can't hold jobs,

500
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:47,542
they can't hold their lives together,
and they end up on the streets.

501
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:51,967
[Trina McDonald] My partner, Amy,
I met her a few years ago.

502
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:54,986
I was going and trying to do
some stuff at the gym.

503
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:59,338
[Amy Rosaaen‐McDonald] 
When I first saw Trina

504
00:32:59,338 --> 00:33:06,625
I was at the gym and I look over
and it was like the universe was like,

505
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:13,493
I was like, "Oh, there you are."

506
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:18,001
Well I knew there was something 
"special" about her for sure.

507
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:23,078
When we first started dating,
it was hard.

508
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:27,645
The biggest hurdle
was not taking PTSD personally.

509
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:46,164
It does get really stressful.

510
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:47,653
[Trina McDonald] If I've ever lived 
with anyone,

511
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:51,130
it's just been with that person.
So when I moved in,

512
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:57,112
it was like "Oh, my God", 
you know, it was Amy, three boys.

513
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:58,846
[Amy Rosaaen‐McDonald] 
I'm not just moving in with Amy,

514
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:01,016
I'm moving in with an entire family.

515
00:34:01,016 --> 00:34:04,420
[Trina McDonald] So, they were so used 
to such open space,

516
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:09,522
and with my PTSD, 
we had some moments.

517
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:13,167
[Tim and Mitch Rosaaen] I'm sort of sad
to have never known Trina beforehand

518
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:21,200
when she was sort of in her prime.
Now she's anxious and sad a lot.

519
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,068
$$ Women who have been raped 
in the military have a PTSD rate

520
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:30,513
higher than men 
who've been in combat. $$

521
00:34:30,513 --> 00:34:40,156
[Trina McDonald] A lot of times,
if we're out doing something,

522
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:44,917
you know, Mitch will be like, checking in 
like, "Oh, it's okay Trina. It's alright."

523
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:51,829
I'm appreciative of it, you know,
but it makes me really sad

524
00:34:51,829 --> 00:35:00,927
that here's this little 11‐year‐old boy 
that's watching out for my well‐being.

525
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:30,440
It hurts. I want it to go away, you know, 
and it doesn't go away.

526
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,236
[Russell Strand] I think that the men
that we attract in the military,

527
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:35,106
you know, we've got the army of one,
you know, be all you can be,

528
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:38,174
all those things we've had 
for so many years

529
00:35:38,174 --> 00:35:40,109
are very, very heavily masculine.

530
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:43,206
Masculinity cannot be victimized, 
because if you're a leader,

531
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:48,406
if you're a masculine person, 
and you're victimized, then you're weak.

532
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:53,426
The problem is anybody 
can be a victim of sexual assault.

533
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:57,516
[Michael Matthews] 
I joined the service in 1972.

534
00:35:57,516 --> 00:36:04,655
The military is a great way of life. 
I got to see the world, I got educated.

535
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:11,407
I loved the military. I was 19 
and I went to the chow hall alone,

536
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:14,246
and the next things I know, 
I was laying on the ground,

537
00:36:14,246 --> 00:36:17,853
and I was struck from behind,
and two guys were holding me down,

538
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:22,918
and one guy 
was pulling my pants down.

539
00:36:22,918 --> 00:36:29,373
And, you know, he was 
taking care of his business.

540
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:32,710
And you know I struggled, 
and I was being struck and hit

541
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:37,243
and told to shut up or they'd kill me.

542
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:42,170
And I see how it destroyed my life.
I mean, I've been married three times.

543
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:48,532
Luckily I have a wife right now who
I've been married to for 25 years.

544
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:49,578
[Jeri Lynn Matthews] 
You start wondering

545
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:52,496
and you start sort of, 
you know either coming up

546
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:55,121
with reasons why things 
are the way they are.

547
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:58,184
And for a long time, I kept thinking,

548
00:36:58,184 --> 00:37:02,762
I don't know, there's something else.

549
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,261
[Michael Matthews] I had never told 
anybody in over thirty years.

550
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:09,217
I decided to tell my wife.

551
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:12,605
It was the scariest moment of my life. 
I was going to tell my wife,

552
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:16,051
she was going to leave me, 
and I would be lost with out her.

553
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:20,155
I mean, honest to God,
I couldn't get up every morning

554
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:26,499
without my wife, you know.
And I told her.

555
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:30,259
[Jeri Lynn Matthews] I felt horrified, 
and I felt sad and I felt angry,

556
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:36,362
along the course of the evening, 
feelings just started to surface

557
00:37:36,362 --> 00:37:41,074
that were probably just simmering
for a very very long time.

558
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:43,828
And she put her arms around me

559
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,020
and we just sat there and sobbed.

560
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:54,121
It was like, this great weight
had been lifted off of me.

561
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:55,785
[Brigadier Gen. Loree Sutton] 
I think it's important to recognize

562
00:37:55,785 --> 00:38:00,253
that military sexual trauma 
is not limited to women,

563
00:38:00,253 --> 00:38:02,667
and in fact, 
when it comes to the absolute numbers,

564
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:07,332
because of the proportion of men,
in much larger numbers than women,

565
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:12,001
actually the numbers are even greater.

566
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:13,658
[Russell Strand] I think one of the 
last bits of research,

567
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,775
showed that about 1% of males 
had been victims of sexual assault

568
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:18,940
in the last year in the military.

569
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,772
That equals about 20,000.

570
00:38:20,772 --> 00:38:22,662
[Jeremiah Arbogast] You would get labeled 
as a 'buddy‐fucker'

571
00:38:22,662 --> 00:38:27,192
and that's not a nice term
to be related to.

572
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:30,295
So, it's just one of those things 
that you don't talk about

573
00:38:30,295 --> 00:38:33,629
or you don't bring to anyone's attention.
You kind of just keep to yourself.

574
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:37,789
[Amando Javier] It's really, really 
hard to forget.

575
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:42,949
You know up until now,
they live in my head,

576
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:47,230
I can hear them laugh,
I can see their faces,

577
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,877
I can see what they're doing to me.

578
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:58,459
[Brian Lewis] I felt scared 
and I was scared to tell my friends,

579
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:02,340
the people that really knew me 
the truth about what happened.

580
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,538
[Helen Benedict] The shame, 
as bad as it is for women

581
00:39:05,538 --> 00:39:09,548
is even worse for men, because
it's all tied in with homophobia.

582
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,948
[Susan Avila Smith] The people 
who are doing the raping are not gay.

583
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:16,020
That's not the problem. They're worried 
about gays in the military.

584
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,970
The gays are not the rapists.

585
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,588
They are heterosexual men
for the most part.

[Capt. Anu Bhagwati] This is not 
an issue of sexual orientation,

587
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,923
this is simply an issue of power
and violence.

588
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:27,735
Male sexual predators
for the large part, have targeted

whether that's men or women.

that there is evidence that another
woman has been sexually assaulted,

592
00:39:39,238 --> 00:39:41,317
the question I keep asking myself is,

tonight with Peter Jennings. *

598

[Peter Jennings] Good evening, we're going 
to begin tonight by putting a human face

599
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:03,821
on the worst case of sexual harassment 
in the navy's history.

600
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:07,918
At an annual Naval Aviators Convention
called, the Tailhook Convention,

601
00:40:07,918 --> 00:40:12,199
*Senior officers have known since 1985 
that the convention included *

*the so called, <i>gauntlet</i>, 
set up for the specific purpose <i>*</i>

603
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,920
of targeting and sexually molesting women.

604
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:22,234
[Paula Coughlin] I got off the elevator 
on the third floor.

605
00:40:22,234 --> 00:40:24,489
You could see maybe 200 men.

606
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:31,168
It was just a few steps into the hallway 
before they closed ranks all around me.

607
00:40:31,168 --> 00:40:35,628
And then it happened very quickly, 
from both sides and from behind,

608
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:39,327
many came in 
and started reaching in my shirt.

609
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:43,307
I was getting pushed down to the floor
and someone was reaching under my skirt

610
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,447
pulling my underwear off, and you know,

611
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:50,686
and it was about maybe 30 or 40 feet 
of 200 guys trying to pull my clothes off,

612
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:53,563
like I was a high valued target.

613
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,622
The next morning I met with 
my boss for breakfast

614
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,731
and I said,
"You know, what happened here?"

615
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:03,047
And he said, "Well that's what you get
for walking down

616
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:05,607
a hallway full of drunk aviators."

617
00:41:06,352 --> 00:41:09,776
And I said, "I don't think so. "

618
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:12,938
*[Peter Jennings] An investigation
was finally begun, *

619
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:17,397
*but 1500 interviews later, 
the Navy's inspector general reported *

620
00:41:17,397 --> 00:41:20,516
that his investigators
were being stone walled.

625
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:41,363

they had assaulted to another NCO.

[Reimer] That unacceptable conduct

serious problems of sexual assault 
at the academy, yet failed to take action.

642

- We don't intend to sweep this 
under the rag, we take it very seriously,

where the reaction 
of the Air Force Academy

648

seems to be to blame the victim.

*[Capt. Ben Klay] She would stay at work late 
and then she would drive home*

676
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,710

on some little sort of high

00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,829
and tell me how she loves her job.

She was this sweet person who 
was trying really hard in succeeding.

*[Ariana Klay] One of the first things 
I was told when I checked in was,*

680
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:19,144
"Don't where any makeup 
because the marines will all think

681
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:20,951
you're going to want to sleep with them."

682

[Elle Helmer] The atmosphere off the bat 
at Marine Barracks Washington was horrible.

had I performed to get my orders there.

"Female marines here are nothing
but objects for the marines to fuck."

688

[Active Duty Marine] So, the minute a female
shows up at my work,

689
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,503
she is immediately pounced on.

690

All of the new females get talked about, 
saying that they're having sex,

691

sleeping with so and so. 
Apparently I slept with all these men,

and I mean, I didn't.

693
00:45:58,352 --> 00:46:00,769
[Ariana Klay] It got progressively
worse and worse.

694
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:05,054
They determined that I welcomed the
sexual harassment by wearing

*my regulation length uniform skirt 
and running in running shorts.*

696

There were several junior female
marines that came up to me crying,

697
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:19,450
while I was there saying that 
they felt too humiliated to come to work.

going out and partying and drinking.

were mandatory to me.

She's like, "We do our best work 
at these events."

712
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:20,600
*[Elle Helmer] We went to various pubs 
and bars and the goal*

713
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,063
*was to do a shot at each one.

to the point of peeing in their pants*

716

This is the norm.

717
00:47:34,381 --> 00:47:38,429
*[Elle Helmer] At one bar, I had water, 
and I was ordered a shot anyway*

718
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:41,810
and was told I needed to take
two shots to make up for that.

$$ March 16, 2006. $$

*I left the bar to get a cab.*

721

My company commander followed me
and said,

722
00:47:49,134 --> 00:47:55,660
"I need to talk to you about some things." 
So we walked up the stairs in to his office.

and the next thing I realized was
I had woken up wearing his shorts

727
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,164
with all of my clothes off 
and in tremendous pain.

728
00:48:15,164 --> 00:48:18,469
I knew enough about me
that something wasn't right

729
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:20,704
and I had felt entirely violated.

730
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:25,347
$$ The day after the incident, 
NCIS opened an investigation.

731
00:48:25,347 --> 00:48:30,137
It was closed three days later 
with no action taken.

732
00:48:31,404 --> 00:48:33,614
Two days later, the base commander
initiated his own investigation. $$

733
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:36,634
The colonel at one point said,
"You know, Lieutenant Helmer,

734
00:48:36,634 --> 00:48:39,721
boys girls and alcohol just don't mix.

735
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:42,681
We'll never really know 
what happened inside that office.

736
00:48:42,681 --> 00:48:45,783
Only you and the major know
and he's not talking.

737
00:48:45,783 --> 00:48:49,646
So, at this point, the investigation 
is closed for a lack of evidence

738
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:52,882
and we've reopened a new investigation
against you

739
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:57,503
for conduct unbecoming of an officer
and public intoxication."

740
00:49:00,784 --> 00:49:04,042
[Active Duty Marine] I remember 
going to the bar,

741
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:07,115
and there were officers,
they were buying shots for us.

742
00:49:07,115 --> 00:49:11,686
After I had a couple of drinks,
that's all I remember.

743
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:16,461
$$ The same officer stalked and raped her 
on three separate occasions. $$

744
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:20,120
This officer bragged 
to his fellow officer friends

745
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:25,443
that he had 'bagged' me.
I got called up to a major's office

746
00:49:25,443 --> 00:49:30,104
and he charged me 
with fraternization and adultery.

747
00:49:30,148 --> 00:49:33,903
He was married, I wasn't,
and I was charged with adultery.

748
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:40,325
*[Ariana Klay] I told the battalion XO 
about the humiliation and the comments,*

749
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:44,109
and he said, "You know you should do 
what a marine officer should do

750
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:48,140
and that's to ignore it and move on."

751
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:54,979
[Ben Klay] I used to lie awake in bed, 
you know, wondering what I could do

752
00:49:54,979 --> 00:49:56,856
to help her get out.

753
00:49:56,856 --> 00:50:01,828
$$ After a weekly drinking event 
in August 2010, Ariana was raped

754
00:50:01,828 --> 00:50:03,697
by a senior officer 3and his friend. $$

755
00:50:03,697 --> 00:50:08,993
[Ariana Klay] He said that if I told anybody 
that he was going to have his friend Marve

756
00:50:08,993 --> 00:50:12,019
from Indiana kill me and throw me in a ditch,

757
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:15,081
because that's how they
took care of things in Indiana.

758
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:21,062
[Ben Klay] She went to war and 
gave nine years of her life,

759
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:26,743
and for them to take it 
and come back and say,

760
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:32,415
"Yes they called you a whore, 
yes they called you a slut,

761
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:35,378
yes they called you a walking mattress,
it's documented

762
00:50:35,378 --> 00:50:39,399
over and over and over again,
but you deserved it

763
00:50:39,399 --> 00:50:43,980
and when you complained about it,
you were welcoming it."

764
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:48,965
[Ariana Klay] The actions of my seniors 
both in the assault and in the ensuing

765
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:53,307
investigations have really destroyed me.

766
00:50:55,288 --> 00:51:00,063
[Capt. Ben Klay] When your wife
doesn't come home to--

767
00:51:02,543 --> 00:51:07,049
rummage through the house
searching for the suicide notes,

768
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:12,780
to call the police with one hand

769
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,329
while you're restraining her 
from killing herself with the other.

770
00:51:22,945 --> 00:51:25,684
*[Ariana Klay] I think the thing 
that makes me the most angry*

771
00:51:25,684 --> 00:51:28,219
*is not even the rape in itself,*

772
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:32,907
it's the commanders that were complicit 
in covering everything up that happened.

773
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:35,130
$$ The filmmakers contacted
five female marines

774
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:39,589
who were each assaulted by an officer 
while serving at Marine Barracks Washington.

775
00:51:42,568 --> 00:51:51,827
Four of the women were investigated 
or punished after they reported.

776
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:59,676
No officer was punished for any assault. $$

777
00:51:59,676 --> 00:52:03,303
*[Capt. Ben Klay] This is an organization
that gives commanders*

778
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:06,031
an unbelievable amount of power.

779
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:11,282
And I felt it, as a lieutenant in Iraq,
it's scary. You appoint the prosecution,

780
00:52:11,282 --> 00:52:13,320
you appoint the defense, 
you appoint the investigator,

781
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,312
you're in charge of the police force, 
you're in charge of the community.

782
00:52:17,611 --> 00:52:21,806
You own everything. You are judge,
you are jury, you are executioner.

783
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:25,622
[Susan Burke] Most Americans assume 
there is access to a system of justice,

784
00:52:25,622 --> 00:52:29,747
so that, for example if you're a civilian 
and you're raped, you can call the police

785
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,693
and then you have prosecutors,

786
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:34,532
either federal prosecutors, state 
prosecutors, local prosecutors,

787
00:52:34,532 --> 00:52:39,063
that bring the perpetrator to justice.
The problem with the military is that

788
00:52:39,063 --> 00:52:42,844
they instead have to go 
to their chain of command.

789
00:52:42,844 --> 00:52:45,534
[Admiral Anthony Kurta] Now in our 
system of military justice,

790
00:52:45,534 --> 00:52:52,173
it is the commander who's responsible
to the chain of command

791
00:52:52,173 --> 00:52:55,233
for how that investigation proceeds.

792
00:52:55,615 --> 00:52:58,216
[Stace Nelson] I know that there's been 
numerous times over my career that I

793
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:04,182
regretted that an individual commander 
had the total say so over a case.

794
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:09,570
Most of them don't have the training
or the education to determine

795
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,566
what's appropriate and
in serious felony investigations.

796
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:15,326
[Captain Greg Rinckey] The problem 
in the military is the convening authority

797
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:18,978
who is not legally trained, 
makes the final decision.

798
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:23,228
[Jessica Hinves] They had 
a change of command

799
00:53:23,228 --> 00:53:26,714
at my old squadron where the guy
that raped me was still stationed.

800
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:30,670
He had only been in command 
for four days,

801
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:34,290
and he made a decision 
over legal to stop the case.

802
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,313
[Capt. Anu Bhagwati] What I saw
was commanders,

803
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,074
and these are field grade officers,

804
00:53:38,074 --> 00:53:42,272
lieutenant colonels, 
colonels who have been in 20, 25 years,

805
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:48,875
they are career officers,
and they sweep cases under the rug.

806
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,175
[Major Gen. Dennis Laich] The last thing 
a company commander in the army

807
00:53:53,175 --> 00:53:57,926
wants to do, is make the phone call 
to his or her battalion commander to say

808
00:53:57,926 --> 00:54:02,001
I have had an allegation 
of a rape in my unit.

809
00:54:02,512 --> 00:54:06,325
This is viewed in many cases 
as a failure to command

810
00:54:06,325 --> 00:54:10,459
that will adversely then 
affect their career.

811
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:14,167
[Stace Nelson] Sometimes you would see 
a guy get four or five years for selling

812
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,483
a minor amount of drugs,
and then you would a guy

813
00:54:16,483 --> 00:54:19,249
get two weeks extra duty for rape.

814
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:24,633
[Susan Burke] The military hides behind 
this notion that it is really, really hard.

815
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:29,054
Almost impossible to prosecute rape.
*But when you look at prosecution rates*

816
00:54:29,054 --> 00:54:36,260
*in the 2010 Department of Defense reports, 
you begin with 2,410 unrestricted reports*

817
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,499
*and 748 restricted.*

818
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,992
*What this means is they've already
funneled 748 sexual assault victims*

819
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:48,447
*into a system that has absolutely 
no adjudication whatsoever.*

820
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:51,707
*Then you take the 2,410 
that have been reported,*

821
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:55,482
*of those they have identified
3,223 perpetrators.*

822
00:54:56,071 --> 00:54:58,173
*Now what happens 
once you send a perpetrator*

823
00:54:58,173 --> 00:55:01,352
*over to command?
Well, the command has just completely*

824
00:55:01,352 --> 00:55:04,442
*unfettered discretion to do 
whatever it is they want.*

825
00:55:04,442 --> 00:55:09,121
*And what is it that they do do? 
First off, they drop 910 of them,*

826
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:13,950
*they just don't do anything. Then of the 
1,025 that they actually take some action,*

827
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:18,805
*do they court martial them? No.
Only half of them, 529,*

828
00:55:18,805 --> 00:55:21,468
*actually got court-martialed.*

829
00:55:21,468 --> 00:55:25,493
*The rest, 256 were subjected to
Article 15 punishments,*

830
00:55:25,493 --> 00:55:28,176
*109 to administrative discharges,*

831
00:55:28,176 --> 00:55:32,124
*and 131 to "other adverse administrative
actions",*

832
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,092
*whatever the heck that means.*

833
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:37,355
*And then of the convictions
where they actually get jail time,*

834
00:55:37,355 --> 00:55:39,724
*when you work your way all the way 
through the numbers,*

835
00:55:39,724 --> 00:55:44,018
*what you're looking at, 
is that out of 3,223 perpetrators,*

836
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:48,010
*only 175 end up doing
any jail time whatsoever.*

837
00:55:48,662 --> 00:55:51,833
*[Louise Slaughter] I have been
in congress for seven terms now,*

838
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:55,938
and every single term, 
we have had meetings with D.O.D

839
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:59,986
and they come in and they confirmed
to us, "We're going to be serious,"

840
00:56:00,017 --> 00:56:04,376
"we're going to take care of this,
we're going to stop this, zero tolerance."

841
00:56:04,376 --> 00:56:10,734
But the rhetoric is not being turned 
into the reality of protecting our women,

842
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:13,965
and in some cases men in our military.

843
00:56:13,965 --> 00:56:16,104
[Susan Avila Smith] So then they're like, 
but we have this SARC

844
00:56:16,104 --> 00:56:18,432
and SAPRO program, it's like, 
"Oh great."

845
00:56:19,863 --> 00:56:21,901
*What does that do?*

846
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:25,876
*They can strongly suggest to the 
military to do something.*

847
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:30,895
*- As a band of brothers and sisters,
it is our personal duty*

848
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:32,825
*to prevent sexual assault*

849
00:56:32,825 --> 00:56:36,923
- They can't order them, they can't 
enforce it, they don't back it up.

850
00:56:36,923 --> 00:56:38,860
[Dr. Kaye Whitley] In April of this year, 
we will debut

851
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,489
a social marketing campaign
as part of our prevention strategy.

852
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:45,535
- *Preventing sexual assault
is part of my duty*

853
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:51,042
-* So when I saw my buddy's date was drunk
I told him, "Ask her when she's sober" *

854
00:56:51,382 --> 00:56:55,356
*[Capt. Anu Bhagwati] It's ludicrous,* 
it's 2011 and we have posters

855
00:56:55,356 --> 00:56:58,917
that say, "Wait until she's sober."
I mean, it's remarkable that

856
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:02,258
that's allowed to pass in today's military.

857
00:57:02,258 --> 00:57:05,271
[Dr. Kaye Whitley] Well, we've implemented 
training at each entry level

858
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:08,992
of military service from the moment 
they enter the service and basic training.

859
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,517
They are given that.

860
00:57:10,517 --> 00:57:15,024
*And, our campaign consists 
of a series of posters that are actually*

861
00:57:15,024 --> 00:57:18,381
*training tools and each of those posters
has a different focus.*

862
00:57:18,406 --> 00:57:23,006
[Capt. Anu Bhagwati] You cannot prevent 
sexual assault with pretty posters.

863
00:57:23,319 --> 00:57:27,122
Posters do not prevent sexual predators 
from preying upon women

864
00:57:27,122 --> 00:57:28,729
and men in the military.

865
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:31,315
We're talking about barging into rooms 
in the middle of the night.

866
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:34,204
No poster can prevent a criminal
from barging into your room.

867
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:35,950
These are violent people.

868
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,587
[Dr. Kaye Whitley] Well one of the things 
that we do in our prevention strategy

869
00:57:38,587 --> 00:57:43,635
is to focus on bystander intervention. 
And in that strategy and in that training

870
00:57:43,635 --> 00:57:46,702
we ask each soldier, sailor, 
airman and marine,

871
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:49,668
to be aware of what sexual assault is

It misses an opportunity to take real steps

895
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:02,762
towards preventing rape.
If they actually had systems

I have to initiate.

938
01:01:27,224 --> 01:01:28,431

939
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:31,091
sometimes I'll cringe 
and I'll just want him to--

940
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,297
he'll feel it, and then he'll get mad 
because he'll be like,

941
01:01:35,297 --> 01:01:37,089
"Why aren't you hugging me back
or whatever?"

and I don't fully understand now.

the hard part, I don't know--

949
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:07,021
I want to help you, but I don't know,
you know?

950
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:12,930

That's the thing, cause you can't.

951
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,868
*Sometimes I think, if when he's 
have sex with me,*

01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:19,082
is he thinking about me getting raped,
is he upset, is he, you know,

953

because I think about that, and never
does it not run through my head.

954
01:02:25,307 --> 01:02:29,076
*That's why I didn't want

were in my spot?

956
01:02:30,822 --> 01:02:35,129

I'm not saying I don't appreciate you,

957
01:02:35,864 --> 01:02:37,687
But it make me cry, baby,

958
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,755
this is why I don't talk about it Rob, 
because it does upset me.

959
01:02:42,911 --> 01:02:45,087
Like when we almost split up 
'cause of stuff,

960
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:48,398
and I feel like I'm responsible for it.

961
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:55,205
I don't know what I'd do if I lost Rob.
I'd be so lost.

962
01:02:56,307 --> 01:03:01,173
He's like my only supporter.
Like my own blood.

963
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:11,266
*- [Amy Herdy] I've interviewed women
in the civilian world,*

964
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:15,479
and rape is a very traumatizing thing 
to have happened,

965
01:03:15,479 --> 01:03:18,376
but I've never seen trauma
like I've seen from women

966
01:03:18,376 --> 01:03:22,006
who are veterans who have
suffered military sexual trauma.

967
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,582
- [Stace Nelson] I cannot remember
how many times

968
01:03:24,582 --> 01:03:26,584
a young female marine 
that had been raped

969
01:03:26,584 --> 01:03:29,353
or sexually assaulted had told me
that she looked at these guys

970
01:03:29,353 --> 01:03:32,206
as her brother, 
or the suspect as her brother.

971
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:38,621
- [Brigadier Gen. Loree Sutton] It's akin to 
what happens in a family with incest.

972
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:45,510
Because in the military, when we're 
functioning at our best in a cohesive unit,

973
01:03:46,324 --> 99:59:59,999
what brothers and sisters, you know,
the band of brothers and sisters,

974
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean we are family.
When that bond of trust is violated,

975
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the wound penetrates to the very most 
inner part of one's soul, one's psyche.

976
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] I have this folder that I keep.
I have all my boot camp letters in it,

977
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from my mom and my sister
and I was just going through it

978
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I was like, "What is this?", and I was
like, "Oh my god, my suicide letter."

979
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Mom, I'm sorry for the grief 
that you must feel.

980
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just because I'm gone physically
doesn't mean I won't be there spiritually.

981
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I truly feel that God will
take me without question,

982
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
even though I took my own life.
I've had the most broken thoughts,

983
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
dreams, and physical pain to remind me
of the horrific acts upon me

984
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that happened while on duty. A mother, 
brother, sister and husband should

985
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
never live knowing the acts upon me,
find peace in knowing that the body

986
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
left behind doesn't consume my soul.
I am free now, and not afraid.

987
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Ready to soar, Kori Danielle."

988
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Trina McDonald] 
I took a whole bottle of pills.

989
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And woke up strangely enough, 
I'm not sure why.

990
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
At that point in my life
I just wanted it to be over.

991
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think I was 20, 21 and then 
within the next year, I tried again.

992
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Michael Matthews] I went out 
into the garage,

993
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which was separate from the house,
and I turned the car on.

994
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I was going to sit in the car
and asphyxiate myself.

995
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we have this little poodle, 
Blondie,

996
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
she went out in the little doggy door
and she's scratching at the door,

997
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm like, "Shut up, Goddammit!
You're going to wake my wife up."

998
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I get out, shut the car off,
and I thought for a moment,

999
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe I'll just take her
in the garage with me,

1000
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I thought,
"Why would you kill a dog?"

1001
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then I thought, 
"Well why would you kill yourself?"

1002
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Hannah Sewell] I thought of it, 
so many times,

1003
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in so many ways. I thought about,
at one point in time,

1004
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hanging myself from the flagpole,

1005
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with a sign on me saying exactly
what happened, to make him feel bad.

1006
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] I was going to overdose 
on pain medication

1007
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and sleeping medication 
and hope that I would fall asleep

1008
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and my body would just shut down,
or do something.

1009
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When I went to the doctor, 
I had been feeling sick,

1010
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and dizzy and nauseated,
and they took my urine

1011
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they told me 
that I was pregnant.

1012
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it was like, there's a life in there,

1013
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and maybe her life 
will be better than mine,

1014
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I've got to make sure of that. 
So, she's very special.

1015
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Brigadier Wilma Vaught] Sometimes 
it takes a different kind of action

1016
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to cause change to come, 
and sometimes that's a lawsuit.

1017
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Susan Burke] I grew up on military bases. 
My dad was career army.

1018
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When I was a child, 
when we answered the phone,

1019
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we would have to say,
"Colonel Burke's quarters,"

1020
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and because of that,

1021
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I have the understanding of the
level of control

1022
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that perhaps most 
in the civilian life don't have.

1023
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Feres Doctrine
is a judicial doctrine

1024
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that was developed by
the Supreme Court that says,

1025
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
although the United States 
is going to allow people

1026
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that are hurt by the government,
to sue, just as you could sue a company,

1027
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
congress could not possibly have meant
to include the military in that.

1028
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now Congress did not actually say that,
rather it's a judicial interpretation

1029
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of what they must have meant. 
If you're in the military,

1030
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you cannot sue for something 
that happens to you

1031
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's incident to your military service.

1032
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If military doctors amputate the wrong limb,
you're out of luck.

1033
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can not sue for that harm
that's been done to you,

1034
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we filed a law suit in federal court
on behalf of 16 men and women,

1035
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
seeking to bring
former Secretary Rumsfeld

1036
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and Secretary Gates to justice.

1037
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] I heard about the lawsuit 
and decided to become a part of it

1038
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because I never wanted 
another woman

1039
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to go through what I went through.

1040
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Susan Burke] The law suit alleges 
that they have overseen

1041
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a system that has deprived the
rape survivors their constitutional rights,

1042
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
specifically we alleged
that they deprived them

1043
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of their substance of due process, 
their procedural due process,

1044
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal protection
and first amendment rights.

1045
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] It made me sick 
to see everybody's stories.

1046
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How they kind of closely tie together.

1047
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's consistent, like what
the military does to us.

1048
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] All the things that they've 
put in place are all pretty much intended

1049
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to help women deal
with being raped better,

1050
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's what they're about.

1051
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] I joined the military 
halfway through

1052
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my senior year of high school, 
wanting to serve my country

1053
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and do new things 
and challenge myself in a different way.

1054
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I was in the army for about 7 or 8 years 
before anything happened to me.

1055
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I was raped by another CID agent
who was senior to me.

1056
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I was contacted by an agent
with Fort Riley CID,

1057
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who said theywere investigating 
the suspect as a serial rapist

1058
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who had raped several military 
law enforcement women.

1059
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I thought, you know, there was 
no way he wouldn't be convicted.

1060
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I have a difficult time with anything,

1061
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's about the fact that I had 
an almost ten-year career

1062
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that I was very invested in, and I 
gave it all up to report a sex offender

1063
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who was not even put to justice
or put on the registry,

1064
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and he's probably doing 
the same thing right now.

1065
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Sarah Albertson] 
I had one female lieutenant

1066
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pull me aside and tell me she had heard
about her case

1067
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and she thought she could talk to me 
from one female marine to another,

1068
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and she said,
"Well what he did, was capitalize

1069
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on an opportunity 
that you presented him.

1070
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's not the same thing as rape,
you need to know that.

1071
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A month after it happened, they made me
go on a hike with him,

1072
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I tried to make everyone 
advocate for me not to go

1073
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because I just couldn't deal
with seeing him,

1074
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so their solution to that 
was to put him in front of me,

1075
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that I could see him the whole time, 
so that I could know where he was

1076
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and know that he 
wasn't able to do anything

1077
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because he was standing 
right in front of me.

1078
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I remember thinking the entire time
we were up on the hills,

1079
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
up at Camp Pendleton,
if only it was steeper,

1080
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I would have jumped.

1081
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] There's no way out of it, 
I mean if you think of it,

1082
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the only way out of it 
is suicide or AWOL.

1083
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Those are your only options.
Suicide, AWOL or deal with it.

1084
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Regina Vasquez] Right now, 
I'm just barely appreciating

1085
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
learning how to appreciate 
being a woman again.

1086
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's 11 years, 
and I'm trying to have fun with it,

1087
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not forcing myself to have fun. 
I'm trying really hard not to cry

1088
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it just pisses me off.

1089
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Watching you girls having to go
through what I have

1090
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it makes me want to explode.

1091
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] Being here, me wanting to 
commit suicide, I'm not alone.

1092
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Me being hit and raped, I'm not alone. 
Everything.

1093
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The way that they treated me, the way 
that they made me feel, I'm not alone.

1094
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we have all of you guys, with all 
of your knowledge and everything

1095
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you guys are going to stand right up, 
you know, that's awesome.

1096
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's all I'm saying.

1097
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Brigadier Wilma Vaught] I think the women
who are coming forward

1098
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in this law suit are very courageous,

1099
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because they're putting their names
out there for criticism

1100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they're putting their names out there 
in history

1101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as they were the ones who got raped,

1102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's not anything you want
to go through life with.

1103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Capt. Anu Bhagwati] Today I stand
in solidarity

1104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with the courageous women and men
who have served in our armed forces.

1105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The inspirational plaintiffs 
you see before you are a small handful

1106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the tens of thousands 
of troops and veterans

1107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who have been sexually brutalized 
by their fellow service members

1108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
while defending our nation. 
It is time to finally acknowledge

1109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that our military's judicial system
is broken when it comes to these cases.

1110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] My name is Kori Cioca

1111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in my case, my command
was unwilling to help me.

1112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I went for help many times with my
petty officers and I was denied help,

1113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
even with other men saying,
"Please get her away from him.",

1114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it was still allowed.

1115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Sarah Albertson] My name is 
Sarah Albertson.

1116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
People were telling me,
"Don't go to the public because

1117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it will make the military look bad."

1118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] I really feel like it is
my social responsibility

1119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to speak out about this issue, 
especially considering my

1120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
investigative experience and especially 
because the military justice system

1121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
allows so many offenders
to escape justice.

1122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] She's actually starting
to play with her toys.

1123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] Imaginative playing.

1124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] It's all the stuff
that you teach them

1125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when they play, you know. 
It's really cool.

1126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] I miss my baby.

1127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] I do, too.

1128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Thank you for having us.

1129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Chellie Pingree] Sure.

1130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Thanks for being willing to fill me
in a little bit on the experiences.

1131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Regina Vazquez] My name is
Regina Vazquez and I served honorably

1132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the United States Marine Corps
for four years.

1133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] My name is Kori Cioca

1134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I served in
the United States Coast Guard.

1135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I was harassed 
and sexually assaulted.

1136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] I was administratively 
discharged with no benefits

1137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
after nine and a half years of service.

1138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Louise Slaughter] Women 
should not have to bear that burden.

1139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is not part of what we should have 
to be doing to be doing our jobs.

1140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Mike Turner] We're talking 
about criminal activity.

1141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're talking about a vicious attack 
that is criminal. It is an assault.

1142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] Almost none of the cases 
made it to court‐martial,

1143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and out of the ones that do, 
almost none of them result in conviction.

1144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Loretta Sanchez] It seems to me 
all the times

1145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that I've looked at these things

1146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the command is the one 
who has such so much discretion.

1147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] I think the advocate
should actually be civilians.

1148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Not ones that work in the military.

1149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think we should have actual units,
civilian units.

1150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Jackie Speiere] It absolutely tears
my inside to think

1151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that this has been going on 
as long as it's been going on

1152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we've never addressed it.

1153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Ted Poe]
All people in the military must know,

1154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you're a perpetrator of sexual assault

1155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
against someone else in the military,
we'll be to you.

1156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You're going to be held accountable.

1157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] As a CID agent, 
I found it tremendously frustrating

1158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when I would demonstrate that 
an offender had committed an offense,

1159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and taking it to a commander 
and having a commander

1160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
being the deciding authority.

1161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know, I don't think commanders 
are capable

1162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of making an objective decision.

1163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I do not think it should be in their hands.

1164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Niki Tsongas] So you would suggest 
taking the discretion away from them?

1165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] Yes, absolutely.

1166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Niki Tsongas] 
Congresswoman Davis and I

1167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are both on the 
armed services committee.

1168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Susan Davis] There are 
a number of issues

1169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that you've raised 
that makes me want to go back

1170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and particularly take another look.

1171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Loretta Sanchez] On an 
emotional basis,

1172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what happens after a crime like
that has been committed

1173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is a difficult thing to go through,
and don't think I don't know. I know.

1174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Chellie Pingree] The fact 
that you're willing to tell us

1175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your stories first hand,
makes it much easier for us to go back

1176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and to say you know these are policies
we have to change.

1177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a big deal what you're doing.

1178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] You rarely find people
who stand up for us,

1179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and just thank you so much 
for everything that you do.

1180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Ted Poe] Last year, 
the military received over 3,000 reports

1181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of sexual assault involving 
other members in the service.

1182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This week, 17 veterans are saying
the military ignored their cases

1183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of sexual assault
while they were on active duty.

1184
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Jackie Speiere] Today I'm going 
to talk about seaman Kori Cioca

1185
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who served in the Coast Guard
from August 2005 to June 2007.

1186
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She now suffers from PTSD 
and an abnormal EEG

1187
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
due to nerve damage in her face.

1188
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Cioca later told the press, 
"It's like they didn't care.

1189
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It wasn't important, 
I wasn't important."

1190
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] So, we're eating 
at Bob Evans'

1191
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I overhear a girl 
talking about getting ready

1192
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to go into the military,
so I go over there and try to talk to her.

1193
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Has anybody told you what to
watch for or anything?

1194
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Waitress] My boyfriend's in the navy.

1195
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] So, he knows 
how tough it is for women.

1196
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Waitress] Yeah, he's been in 
for a couple of months now.

1197
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] So, how does he feel 
about you joining?

1198
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Like, isn't he scared that the men 
will do something?

1199
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Waitress] He's a little scared 
but he knows I can take care of myself.

1200
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] Oh I thought so too,
so be careful.

1201
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I definitely let her know that maybe
she should reconsider college

1202
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and getting a degree.
It'll save her some of the trouble.

1203
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I wish someone would have told me that.

1204
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You try to take care okay? 
You can still back out.

1205
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can be a civilian worker.

1206
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Wairess] Yeah, thank you. 
I'm not signed yet.

1207
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] Okay, well, just be careful.

1208
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Maiette Wells] People always ask me, 
"Was it worth it going in?"

1209
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The idea of it is honorable. 
Serving your country is great.

1210
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There are good people in it,
and then there are people

1211
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who will end up ruining your life.

1212
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Lt. Ariana Klay] Just the other day,
I saw a girl running along the road.

1213
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She looked like she
was about high school age.

1214
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She was wearing a USMC T‐shirt, 
and I thought that, if she joins,

1215
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then she's going to have to accept rape 
and destruction of her life.

1216
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I cannot in good faith, I cannot recommend
anyone to join with the way

1217
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the organization is set up now.
I would not wish that on anyone.

1218
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Chellie Pingree] You can't ask
women to serve

1219
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then say, "Oh by the way, if you get
in one of these horrendous situations,

1220
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we won't be there to back you up 
or to help you."

1221
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Loretta Sanchez] When I would do 
nominations for the air force academy,

1222
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it was difficult to talk to parents 
and say,

1223
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Don't worry, she's not going to get raped."

1224
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Christina Jones] No. I would tell
my daughter not to join the military.

1225
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They have good things to offer 
but a rape is not one of them.

1226
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Miette Wells] Not in my lifetime. 
She's not joining, no.

1227
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rob McDonald] I would be terrified 
if my daughter wanted to join the military.

1228
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I would have a serious long talk 
and hope that the one thing

1229
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is that's what she'd listen to.

1230
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Brigadier Gen. Loree Sutton]
Losing even one soldier,

1231
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
needlessly, because of military sexual
trauma, is one too many.

1232
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] I'm going to get the mail. 
Fingers crossed. Here's my fate.

1233
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rob McDonald] What does it say?

1234
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] Effective October 20th 2009. 
My overall combined rating is 70%.

1235
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Wait. Service connection for anxiety
is denied,

1236
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
service connection for disk placement

1237
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and bilateral disk displacement
is denied.

1238
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Those motherfuckers, man. 
Oh, my god.

1239
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My face doesn't have any disks in it, 
that's what the x‐rays show.

1240
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rob McDonald] How can you deny 
medical help when there's x‐rays?

1241
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you do not agree with our decision 
you should write us and tell us why.

1242
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca]
'Cause you're an asshole.

1243
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rob McDonald] And you
should identify specific issues.

1244
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] You're an idiot.

1245
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rob McDonald] The evidence
that was reviewed showed that

1246
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you served whatever, which is less than 
minimum active duty requirements

1247
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for disability pension.

1248
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it wasn't your choice.

1249
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] They're going 
to punish me for what they did,

1250
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because I was short two months 
of two years. I know.

1251
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I feel the same way, Shea.

1252
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Dr. Kaye Whitley] It's nice to see you again 
and thank you for coming.

1253
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You have been provided highlights 
of the numbers of the report

1254
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm going to walk you
through those slides,

1255
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then I'm going to play a short 
public service announcement

1256
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we can entertain questions.

1257
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think the prevention aspect 
of sexual assault

1258
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
goes back in some ways to risk reduction.

1259
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
*[Kirby] What is risk reduction? *

1260
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Dr. Kaye Whitley] Risk reductions 
are ideas like telling women to--

1261
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if they're going to go somewhere, 
always have a buddy with them.

1262
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
*[Kirby] Are there other examples
of risk reduction? *

1263
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Dr. Kaye Whitley] I'm not familiar, 
but that's out of my area of expertise.

1264
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
$$ August 1, 2011, 
Major General Mary Kay Hertog

1265
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
replaces Kaye Whitley as the Director 
of the Sexual Assault and Prevention Office. $$

1266
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] Well,
I want to continue where Dr. Whitley left off.

1267
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Looking at where our focus is and that's 
on prevention as well as response,

1268
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we've really done a very good job there 
and the credit goes to Dr. Whitley

1269
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and her staff that has been working this 
the past five to years years.

1270
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Mike Turner] I don't think
the Department of Defense

1271
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has really yet embraced that they have
a sexual assault problem

1272
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that its not just an issue 
of a cultural environment

1273
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or that the people at risk 
of sexual assault.

1274
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The system itself does not value
the rights of victims

1275
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and doesn't provide them
adequate protection.

1276
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] You know, 
I have heard the accusations as well,

1277
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that commanders are sweeping this 
under the carpet.

1278
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, what I would say to the people 
that have come forward to you is that,

1279
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you feel that your commander is 
ignoring what you have asked them to do,

1280
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if they are not taking care of you
within that chain of command,

1281
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you need to go to the DOD,

1282
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the Department of Defense Inspector General.

1283
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Jackie Speier] The GAO, 
General Accounting Office,

1284
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just did a study, a report and guess what,
not one, not one case,

1285
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of more than 2,500 has been reviewed

1286
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and investigated
by the inspector general,

1287
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and when asked about that,
the inspector general said,

1288
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Well, we have other higher priorities."

1289
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Susan Burke] What you really want
is you want there to be a system akin

1290
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to a civilian system 
where you go to the police

1291
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the crime is prosecuted 
by an impartial judicial system.

1292
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] 
As a commander, you have no favorites.

1293
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You are equally to take care 
of every single person

1294
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in your organization.
That's what command is all about.

1295
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Susan Burke] These are
human beings just like everyone else.

1296
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You cannot be impartial when you 
are involved with people in other settings.

1297
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Admiral Anthony Kurta] I would take 
exception with your characterization

1298
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the disposition of the case 
is based on the relationship

1299
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between the commander
and the alleged perpetrator.

1300
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
$$ 33% of female soldiers
didn't report their rape

1301
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because the person to report to 
was a friend of the rapist. $$

1302
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] 
I'm going to speak to you

1303
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with my former commander's hat on.

1304
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is absolutely 
no conflict of interest.

1305
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You do what the right thing is to do.

1306
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You have other avenues and if you feel like you 
have not been taken care adequately

1307
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by your commander,
go up through your congressman,

1308
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or congresswoman, 
file a complaint that way.

1309
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Susan Burke] You can't go to your congressman
to obtain justice for being raped,

1310
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean, imagine how silly that is,
imagine if you told civilians that,

1311
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Oh jeez, sorry you were raped, 
go talk to your congressman."

1312
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
$$ Many of our closest NATO allies 
no longer allow commanders

1313
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to determine the prosecution 
of sexual assault cases. $$

1314
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
*[Amy] If you could say something 
to this guy,*

1315
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what would you want to say to him?

1316
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Jessica Hinves] I don't know.
I don't think it's affected his life at all.

1317
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And people in my old squadron 
that I've talked to,

1318
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they don't see an effect on him at all,
and that hurts

1319
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because it's a struggle every day 
and it's completely changed who I am.

1320
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] I'm really hoping he falls off 
a coast guard boat

1321
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they never find him.
I'm really hoping for that.

1322
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or there's a poor mishap 
and got chopped up by the prop.

1323
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rob McDonald] That would be great.

1324
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] That would be great.

1325
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rob McDonald] That would be 
an exciting day.

1326
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] It would.
I'd probably celebrate.

1327
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Trina McDonald] I hope this 
reaches them too, you know.

1328
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I hope that somewhere
someone sees my face,

1329
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know, wherever it is, and goes,

1330
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"I know them.", 
and they're talking about me

1331
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because they know what they did.

1332
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then all they'll have to mutter 
is to some friend that goes,

1333
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Hey weren't we stationed with her?"
and then it can't be a secret anymore.

1334
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So hopefully they have to deal with it too,

1335
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know, 
in some way shape or form.

1336
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Helen Benedict] Most rapists
are repetitive criminals.

1337
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a kind of crime
that has an obsessive quality

1338
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so people do it again and again.

1339
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the tragedy of that is
that every one of these guys

1340
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who gets off freely, will be doing it 
to other women, again and again,

1341
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
often for years and years and years.

1342
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Russell Strand] The average sex offender 
in their lifetime has about 300 victims,

1343
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the vast majority of sex offenders
will never be caught.

1344
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Myla Haider] A lot of civilians see it 
as being a military problem,

1345
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it really isn't. Because 5% or less 
of reported offenders are convicted,

1346
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so almost none of them wind up
on the sex offender registry.

1347
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] 
There is no military sex offender list

1348
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that I'm aware of but, if you're convicted
in court, a felony conviction

1349
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of sex offense of a sex offense,
you're going to go on the national list.

1350
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
*[Kirby] For any sex offense whatsoever? *

1351
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Major Gen. Mary Kay Hertog] Correct.

1352
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Stace Nelson] That is not the case.
It depends on what level conviction they got.

1353
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If they received over a year,
then that's considered a felony.

1354
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But a lot of these cases are plead down, 
so that they're not felonies.

1355
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The military doesn't like
to prosecute people

1356
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and keep them as felony convictions.

1357
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Russell Strand] I often ask myself 
the question, "Why would they stop?",

1358
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if there's nothing to stop them
like incarceration,

1359
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or some other major life change, 
they're going to continue.

1360
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Stace Nelson] If you run 
a sexual predator

1361
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
through the judicial system

1362
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then you slap him on 
the hand all you've done,

1363
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is you've done the equivalent of the 
catch and release program.

1364
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You've caught them, 
you've educated them,

1365
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now you've released them back
into hometown America.

1366
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He now knows a lot more
about the law enforcement,

1367
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the judicial system, than he did 
when he first started,

1368
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which makes him a much more
capable criminal,

1369
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and a much more dangerous criminal.

1370
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Capt. Anu Bhagwati] They go on to
literally prey on women and men

1371
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in our neighborhoods
across the United States.

1372
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we don't care about women and men 
in the military, then we should hopefully care

1373
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about women and men, girls and boys
in our neighborhood back home.

1374
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
$$ In December 2011, the Court dismissed
the survivor's lawsuit ruling that rape is an

1375
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
occupational hazard of military service.
An appeal has been filed. $$

1376
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Helen Benedict] The thing that broke 
my heart the most about this story,

1377
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
was the young women who went in 
with such idealism,

1378
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to serve my country, 
I want to give back.

1379
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
To see a young person's hope and idealism 
crushed in that brutal way,

1380
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think we owe our young people
more than that.

1381
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Rep. Chellie Pingree] Increasingly,
women are becoming

1382
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some of the best‐trained officials
that we have in the military.

1383
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These are great soldiers 
and we can't afford to lose them.

1384
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Sara Albertson] Yeah, I'm happy
I never have to wear that again.

1385
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Paula Coughlin] People deeply believe
in their hearts to serve their country.

1386
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They should be given that chance,
with respect.

1387
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know, it's part of really 
our American way.

1388
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] Do you think we deserve
a purple heart

1389
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we were wounded
in a time of war?

1390
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Regina Vasquez] They're never going 
to give us one.

1391
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Kori Cioca] I know, but I'm just saying 
maybe there should be a ribbon

1392
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for women who have survived it.

1393
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Dennis Laich] We have a good army,
a good military, but not a great one

1394
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is the kind of issue that keeps 
our military from being great.

1395
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[Brigadier Gen. Loree Sutton] We can 
view this as a shared challenge.

1396
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's not just a woman's issue, 
it's not just something

1397
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the military has to deal with,
but it's society.

1398
